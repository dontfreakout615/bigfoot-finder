2,I was on the side of a hill with three bench flats. I was on the middle flat in my tree climber.   I was hunting by myself and heard two knocks on a tree to the west about almost to the hill top.  After about 45 seconds I heard another knock on a tree low  behind me.  I did not see anything or hear anything else.  I reported this before but called the tree knocks Bonks.   Also while hunting near Kimbrough  AL I heard one tree knock again. This was about 15 30 or 16 00 while I was in my tree climber. ,During Deer season and in a tree climber. ,Wilcox,1,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1131,no
3,I stopped my car to go to the bathroom because I had to go bad and in the woods next to the road there was a horrible hairy man-like creature. It walked toward me and snorted. I was so scared. It had what looked like a small limb or something in its hand. It came up to three feet of me  grunted and walked off. I ran back to the car and got away. I saw it standing in my rear view mirror as I drove away. It was at the edge of the road. I think this monster is dangerous. ,Washington County  on Alabama Highway 56  between Chatom and Wagarville.

4,This happened in 1988 in Nauvoo AL.  I was 14 years old. I was at home in my living room watching TV and my brother was outside working on a car. We were the only ones at home.  The front door was located in the living room. We never used this door because we had no steps to it and the door was about 4 feet from the ground. So we used the back door of the house. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when the door began to move and the door knob was turning. The only thing holding the door shut was a nail someone had nailed at the top of the wall and bent it over to hold the door shut. I first thought it was my brother but he knew we didn  t use the door. As the door was moving just a little I noticed at the bottom of the door where there was a gap  3 fingers slide under the door. My heart began to beat faster  I tried to move but I couldn  t at first. Then I wanted so bad to look out the window beside the door but I was too scared. These fingers were very long and the nails were long too and black. The hand like finger had hair on it dark brown. The hair was long. This only lasted for 3 min. When the fingers move out from the gap the door knob and the door stop moving. About 45 min. later my brother came inside and I asked him why he was trying to use the front door he said he hadn  t. I didn  t tell him what happened until sometime later. Because of fear he wouldn  t believe me and the fear of him using this to scare me later on. ,Wooden area.

5,A friend and I were fishing on Holt lake in tuscaloosa county on day after work.  It was a thursday about mid july of last year (1999).  We had gotten on the water about 6 30 and started fishing.  We put in at Rocky Branch and went up river towards the upper end lock.  Towards night fall we started fishing back toward the launch.  about 11 30 we were fishing a secluded part of the shoreline.  The nearest house was probably 2-3 miles down river.  We were fishing close to the bank when I heard something walking at the top of the hill.  I figured it was a deer and didn  t pay it any more attention.  As we proceeded down the bank the sound started down the hill towards us.  There were two distinct foot steps instead of four like a deer.  I thought I was hearing things so I looked back at my buddy and he was looking up the hill towards the sound.  We decided to go look for another fishing spot (because we were getting a little spooked)and started putting everthing up to make our run.  As we were doing that  whatever it was broke into a run towards us.  Before we could get the boat cranked the creature let out the most herendous snarl and growl I had ever heardand then hit the water after us.  We both love to hunt and spend alot of time outdoors but neither of us had ever heard anything like that  nor could we duplicate it when we would tell people of our encounter.  I hadn  t thought anything else about it until we got on this web site and heard the recording of the growl sound.  That was the closest thing I have heard to the sound we heard that night.  I  v read that usually there is a strong musty smell preceeding most encounters  but we didnt smell anything unusual. Perhaps this was due to the fact that we were in a cross wind with the creature.  We don  t know exactly what it was because we havent gotten up the nerve to go back and look around.  That was probably the last time I have been on the lake.  Everyone we told about this said we were crazy and were hearing things  but none of them will go back with me at night to look for it.  Due to the pale color of my face when I got home about 45min-1hrs later  my girlfriend will not even go the lake.

6,Not a good writer  but what happened to me and a friend  - we were walking down an old pulpwood road with his german shepherd  and got a strong smell like a goat and stopped my friend. I walked ahead about 20 ft and said it might be a big rattle snake  about that time I heard leaves rustling and it got louder and a tree about 6 inches around shook back and forth about 2 feet each way and I heard the leaves moving like something was running away. I pulled some branches back and there it was  about 20 feet running away on 2 legs at a very fast pace. It was about 8 feet tall and I could see its muscles in its legs moving and the whitish skin under the 3 inch black hair. Long arms no neck as plain as day. My friend never saw it and didn  t believe me. But it changed my life. Would like for someone to call me. Two weeks later in the dentist was an outdoors magazine with the Patterson film in it. ,We were right behind a large reservoir that held water for Russell Mills ,Tallapoosa,1,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1123,yes
7,When I was around 11 years old  I had a strange encounter in the field behind my house.  At that time  I believed I saw a crazy old man  but I now realize that is all I could rationalize it to be. I was walking alone at dusk with my dog.  This was not unusual as I loved to be outside- my parents often had to force me inside by calling me in for the night.  Well  from what I can remember of that particular night  I was picking up rocks in a ditch and looking at them.  I might have been looking for a certain kind of rock but I can  t remember exactly what I was doing.  It was definitely getting dark  but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer.  I remember holding a stick I was using to pry rocks out of the dirt.  It was very quiet and still and there wasn  t much wind.  As I was looking at the ground  I heard a noise in front of me and I looked up to see what it was  and that is when I saw him.  He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet  he was tall  but hunched and quietly staring right at me.  He wasn  t much taller than a normal man  but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching.  He looked like Rip Van Winkle to me  and that is what I thought of when I saw him.  He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area  but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body.  I remember the hair was thin at his face  the base of his neck  and upper torso  but thicker around his beard  lower torso and legs.  All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy.  Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters.  His feet were bare.  His face was very humanlike  but not quite normal as it had very exaggerated wrinkles- again  a reason I thought he was a crazy old man.  His head seemed normal  but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner.  He appeared gaunt and thin  but in just a moment I would realize he was not like an old man at all.  I screamed as loud as I could out of fear and I noticed my dog bolted towards the house while I was taking in the sight of this strange thing in front of me.  The shaggy old man let out a scream of his own when I screamed.  He was staring right at me screaming in a voice that sounded like a woman shrieking- he seemed very scared of me as well.  I turned to run for my house.  I looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me and I saw him run up the ditch in the other direction.  He was extremely agile and fast- he was definitely not Rip Van Winkle.  He ran in a full sprint  very quickly for someone so hunched. I think I caught the dog running back to the house  as I was so frightened.  I remember running into the kitchen and telling my Mom there was a crazy old Rip Van Winkle in the field.  I remember describing how he was old looking  hunched  naked  and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn  t cut it in 20 years.  I told her about how he had hair all over his body.  Needless to say  I wasn  t believed.  I became obsessed with what I called  the Shaggy old man  or  the Crazy old man .  I believed that he must have been an old deformed hermit.  I kept a notebook in which I drew many sketches of him.  I remember keeping the notebook secret from my family  hiding it out of fear of being ridiculed.  I wish I had those sketches now but sadly I  ve misplaced that notebook.  I remember I went back to the spot in the field looking for him on other occasions  but I never ran into him again.  I wasn  t aware enough to look for prints or anything like that  but I knew that he was out there somewhere and I wanted to prove he really existed to others. What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website.  I was just browsing their sightings index and I came across several sightings in the same county I lived in and all described white or grayish colored creatures.  Honestly  I didn  t realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time  or even for most of my life  and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation.  I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man  but rather a bigfoot.  When I think back on the sighting  it all makes sense in that light.  There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field  much less to be covered in grayish  white  shaggy tattered hair.  The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot  so the thought never entered my mind.  Also  I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot  and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger.  He looked a bit hungry to me  as he was not some hulking powerful creature  but he was still strong looking and extremely agile. ,Around Moody  Alabama. ,St. Clair,10,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1115,yes
8,I was coming home from work  turning off a major 4 lane hiway.  After aproximately 1/4 mile  near a new subdivision  I saw something moving very fast  as it ran across the hiway in front of my car. It appeared to be 8 to 10 feet tall  with reddish-brown looking hair. It didn  t look at me  but I noticed long hair from its arms  legs and also shoulders. It moved across the road  it appeared  in 4 to 5 strides running. ,Shelby Co. Road 43 north  off State Hwy 280.

9,1981--My first encounter (Sept.)  My girlfriend  her father and I were parked on the bank of the Chattahoochee river.  My girlfriend  s father was sitting on the hood of the car with his fishing pole in front of him.  He was night cat-fishing.  While we sat there  with the car lights shining across the river  my girlfriend and I were sitting in the front seat just making small-talk (honest)  when all of a sudden I heard the most horribly incredible scream coming from my right side.  To set the scene   Our car was parked about two feet from the water  on the bank.  Off to my right about 60 feet was where the foliage began. Very swampy  very thick  and very hard to walk through.  About 40 feet further up the bank (which can  t be seen from our car because of the foliage) is a huge oak tree.  I  d have to guess that the tree had about a 15 foot circumference - massive!  About 10 feet up the tree is a huge branch that went about 20 feet out over the river.  My friends and I would climb the tree and jump/dive into the river at least once every couple of weeks or so.  During one occasion  there were about 9 of us standing on this branch attempting to make it move - we barely made it do anything  let alone shake! Anyway  back to the car. As I heard the scream  my body instantly went into what I think was shock.  As I turned to my right s.l.o.w.l.y.. with all my hair standing straight-up  we heard the next sound~~~>  a chuuu..chuuu..chuuu..chuuuuuuu... (my feeble attempt to describe the sound of that huge branch I mentioned earlier that was shaking due to something GIGANTIC jumping off it into the water.  The splash that came next was equally as horrific.  All we did was just sit there in shock...waiting (I don  t know why)  staring at this point - straight ahead at the water.  My guess is that we were waiting for the thing to float into our headlights. We waited and waited and waited and all of a sudden an object - black - long - I would guess at least 9-10 feet  floated into our headlights and stopped. Please keep in mind that this action was deliberate  because it was floating downstream.  We stared at it forever it seemed.until it opened it  s eyes - two huge balls of red (reflecting off the headlights of our car I imagine) light and looked at us.  My girlfriend  s father at this point put the car into reverse  and we sped off.. extremely terrified. 1982--My second encounter (April)  My girfriend and I were driving back from our senior prom (Georgia - chattahoochee river border area).  Our high school was 37 miles down-river  way-out  in the boon docks.   Anyway  as we were driving back home  we came to a flat 2-mile section of road that had a  slippery-when-wet  sign. Because we were tired   sober   with road-hypnosis  the sign reflection caught our attention (she told me after).   As we came closer to the sign  something moved or reflected as we came closer - getting our attention. About 100 feet away  with our car lights fully shining on the it  we saw this massive  black creature leaning on the sign.  The top of the sign I guessed to be about 10 feet.  Whatever this creature was  all we could see was the top of the chest and down (about 10   of the creature!) we couldn  t see the head.  It just stood there - we could see the massive muscles - most in rippling detail  shiny-black fur  standing with intelligence if you can understand that term  etc.  We sped-up all the while screaming at each other - scared to death.  A mile down the road  my left-rear tire blew out.  I drove 7 miles to the first house with a light and called my father to come out and help us.  While at this home  we talked with a few of the people that were there (they were having a party).  We were told a couple of stories about a missing hunter  animals found gutted or with their head missing.  A lot of strange screams in the night  etc.  First  I must say beyond a shadow of any doubt that this was no hoax - the costume alone would have cost thousands and thousands of dollars to create.  Second  the people that live in the area are extremely poor.  As a matter of fact  the home that we drove-up to after our tire blew  had light seeping through the cracks in the siding of the house  while it sat on cinder blocks - very poor people! ,1981--Bank of the Chattahoochee River 1982--Highway 431N.  Roughly  the sighting occurred at Michael Tigner Dr.  about 3-4 miles North of Seale  AL.  Shouldn  t be too hard to find  since it was the only  yield  or  slippery when wet  sign on the right-hand side (heading North) ,Russell,1,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1113,yes
10,I had noted on my Limestone  Alabama Spring 1978 sighting report that I would eventually submit other sightings that involved myself  others I know or did know or had learned from talking with others. I did not know it would be this long to submit them  but I have since married  had a child  lived in three different locations  had five different jobs among other things since I last submitted that Limestone  Alabama sighting. This sighting/encounter below involved myself  and two freinds  it unexpectdly and without intent being my second. The event I relate here happened to me and two friends in April of 1994 while I was attending Troy State University  Troy. I was undertaking graduate studies at the time. I lived in a campus dorm and had become friends with several people in the dorm and about campus. One of these friends stayed in a room a few doors down. He dated a young woman that stayed in the International House across campus. I had been studying on that paticular night I write of and had become bored with it. My friend knocked on the door and came in. I for the most part had an  open door policy . The door may be open  but knock before you enter so I  ll know you are there. As Kevin and I talked we agreed to go pick up his girlfriend  Donna and go to  Lookout Mountain .  I had been out to the place once before during the day about a month earlier so I offered to drive. We left campus around 11 pm or so. We headed up Hyw. 231 north. About 8 miles from the Campus we turned west/northwest (left) onto Co. Rd. 17   As we got closer to the so-called Lookout Mountian we noticed fewer and fewer houses. After about 15 minutes of driving we had found it and proceeded to park just off the road. We got out of my vehicle and then walked up to the top of this large hill. The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember. It is supposedly the highest point in Pike County. The place seemed to be a well known and well used spot with open areas about the path to the top  besides one could see for several miles to the west  south and east from atop this hill. I recall seeing the rotating beacon that night at the Troy Airport several miles to the south. I knew we were not the first people to walk to the top and hang out nor were we going to be the last. Everything seemed cool. After about 15 to 20 minutes we three decided to head downhill toward the car and find something else to get into. I think we had decided we were going to go to Subway for a late night snack. Now here is where it got weird. Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck  like something was there and we were being watched. Seeing how we were out at night in the country plus having a lady with us  Kevin and I had decided not to be foolish. We had both brought along weapons. I had a Colt .38 stuffed in the back of my pants in its holster and a few extra rounds in my pocket plus a good sharp replica Samurai sword. (Yes  a sword). My friend had a Glock 9mm and an extra magazine of rounds. My friend was in the National Guard at the time. I pulled out the .38 before we got even midway downhill. I had looked over to where Kevin and Donna were to my right. He had already taken out his 9mm so I knew he also sensed something by then as well. It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps. As we moved along I notcied the steps were on both sides of us. By the time we had arrived midway downhill we were aware that there were five maybe six...somebodys or somethings out not far from us. I recall that there were two and I  m pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right. Kevin was closest to the ones on my right so I  m sure he had heard them much better. Also by this time our Donna had become almost hysterical. I  m sure her few screams did not help matters much. Kevin said that it might be some other people messing with us like Frat boys. We stopped breifly. He shouted a few warnings that whomever was there had better leave us alone or speak up  he was ready to open fire. No answers. Nothing. I remained quiet  listening. Now any person in their right mind (perhaps even in a drunken state of mind) would have said something in order to keep from being shot at  I would think  yet there were no answers  no response of any sort. Just slience. We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us  not trying to hide their footfalls. As we approached the bottom of the hill we ran for it   got into the my car as fast as we could   cranked it up quickly   backed up  and took off back the way we had came. I am not sure if whatever they were moved out into the dirt road behind us or not as we drove off. I looked back but  it was really too dark to tell. Aside from that the road was narrow and had trees along each side of it and I was being as careful as I possibly could so as not to run off this road. I don  t recommend under such cirmstances trying to drive out of such a place and look back at the same time. It took several minutes after we got back onto Hwy. 231 for Donna to calm down. I was shaken up but not too bad. I suppose the driving had something to do with it. I  m not sure how Kevin felt. I assume that his military training had taken over for a time back on that hill. We never saw what they were. Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet. At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots. I still feel that is what they were though I can never be 100% sure. Even so  what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior.  After a few months and leaving Grad school I eventually lost contact with those two friends. I  ve not been back to Lookout Mountain since even though I have traveled up and down that part of 231 near there many times. I  m sure with a little driving about those dirt roads off Co. Rd. 17 I can find that hill again. I  m just not too sure I  d want to find it once again at night.  ,The place of the sighting is in North/Northwestern Pike County at a place known by the name  Lookout Mountain . It is not a mountain at all  just a big hill. It is supposed to be the highest point in Pike County  at approx. 100 feet high. Go north on Hwy. 231 out of Troy. Turn left (west/northwest) onto Co. Rd. 17. The  mountain  is a few miles back. Somewhere down Co. Rd. 17 the pavement ends and it becomes a dirt road (if that dirt section has not since been paved) from what I recall. There are other dirt roads going off Co. Rd. 17. Lookout Mountain is just off one of those dirt roads on the left. I may have actually made a right turn somewhere off Co. Rd. 17 to get to Lookout Mountain. I don  t really remember. Besides it was only the second  and last time I had gone out to this place. ,Pike,15,Alabama ,AL,Spring ,1109,yes
11,We were riding along cherokee road in Prescot  a comunity near Moody Al.when rounding a curve we saw what looked like an ape man but humanlike exept for the hair which was all matted and black.it was about 7ft tall and had long arms my wife and I turned around but it was gone. ,there is a boys home about a half a mile on the right from were we saw this creature. ,St. Clair,10,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1115,yes
12,My husband  myself and my husbands friend were walking on a narrow trail to Salt Creek Falls near Talladega National Forest. I stopped on the trail when I smelled a foul smell. We did not see or hear anything at this time. We walked down to the falls the water was very low so we walked out onto the large rocks to sit  we sat talking for about 30 min. I heard a sound like trees moving then I heard nothing else so we were on our way out when we saw a very large footprint in the sandy creek bank. It was approx. 18 inches long and about 7 inches wide it had very pronounced toe prints. ,Salt creek falls close to Cheaha State Park ,Talladega,3,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1121,no
13,Every year me and a group of my friends camp in cheaha state park. Year before last  we where sitting outside our tent around the camp fire and it was about 11 00 at night. We where the ONLY ones in that camp site  so it was very quiet. We started to hear stange low noises almost like an old chainsaw trying to crank. Following that was a very high pitch humming noise. The sound was getting closer and closer. We took out our spot light and scanned the woods. What we saw was very disturbing....it appeared to be an up right figure  that was hairy and had a grey tent to its fure. It was standing behind a tree and was slightly hunching over  like it was hiding from us. We could see its back bowing out of the right side of the tree and its head coming out of the left. Theirs no doubt in my mind that it was an ape-like creature. It stood still for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then we decided to take the light off of it  to maybe see if it would move....about 10 seconds later we turned the light back on and it was gone! The next night we heard two seperate creatures but neither showed up. ,cheaha state park ,Talladega,3,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1121,yes
14,I heard my dogs barking and howling outside. I got my flashlight and opened my door to look out. As I was scanning the woods  my light caught two sets of eye shine. One was approx. seven to eight feet off the ground standing beside a tree. The other was around six feet off the ground standing on the other side of the tree. They were around 15 to 20 feet inside the wood line. It scared the crap out of me  every hair on my body stood on end. This sorta stuff has been going on for the past three years. My dogs start barking every night around 9 30 to 10 00 pm. ,Omitted to protect privacy. ,Talladega,3,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1121,yes
15,It was late June and I was driving home around 2 00 in the morning on a dirt road I use for a short cut from a friends house. It was dark  and cloudy I guess because there was no moon or stars out. I had just crossed over the creek and around a few curves when I saw something huge close to the side of the road. As I proceeded to get closer I turned on my brights. I realized this thing was standing on two feet  and kinda hairy  but looked as if it were humanlike. It looked to be 9 or 10 feet tall  larger that anything I wanted to stop for.  Its back was turned to me as if my lights were blinding it. This was like no human I had ever seen. I pushed the gas pedal as hard as I could  swung the car to the far left  and went around the thing as fast as I could. I never looked back  my heart was pounding because I was so frightened. It was enormous.   I had never really seen anything like that before. I had wondered if my mind was playing tricks on me because I was tired. I never mentioned this incident to anyone I just stopped traveling the road. Up until just a few weeks ago I wouldn  t ride down this road even in the daylight. The reason for me to go back was absolutely amazing. My father  made a discovery of his own. Large footprints  feces  and a trail into the woods not far from where I had seen this  thing . I mentioned my story (about that night) to my parents when they told me about the discovery they had made. I went to the place with them to help cast the prints  take pictures  and collect some of the feces. If it hadn  t been for their discovery  no one would have ever known what I had seen. I still don  t travel that road at night  but have become braver to do it during the day. ,Withheld at witness   request ,Tuscaloosa,4,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1125,yes
16,My husband and some others were preparing a field for planting when he noticed a pile of pooh in the field.  He walked over to it and stated that he wondered what might have made such a large pile. As he looked around for horse or cow tracks  another person walked over to look at it and said  Look at the size of these foot prints .  They all began looking around and found tracks coming out of a grassy area onto a dirt road. The tracks went about 20 feet then turned left into the freshly plowed field (plowed the day before).  They proceded about 30 feet into the field. There you could tell where it paused to squat repositioning it  s feet to do so and did it  s business. While in this position it dug up some turtle eggs in front of it and ate them leaving broken shell behind. The feces were the consistancy of horse droppings in that they were of high fiber content and contained undigested muscadines(a kind of wild grape). But the droppings weren  t in the shape of horse manure (round ballshaped piles) but were long and cylindrical like that of a dog or human. The  feces(2) were about 18-24 inches long and about 2 1/2-3 inches across. Rather large I must say.    The tracks then turned left again into an area of tall grass  small pines and other small trees that lined a field at the edge of the woods. I wasn  t able to follow them very far due to dead branchs  briars and undergrowth that blocked my progress. Plus I was wearing only sandals  shorts  and a tank top. Not prepared to trek through the woods. I took pictures of the  tracks and the feces with a yardstick for size comparison. I also took a specimen of the feces and turtle egg shells which are still in my freezer. I have a cast of a left and right foot. The right one broke trying to pick it up but is still n pretty good shape. The left one is completely intact.  They measure approx 18 inches long  8 inches wide at the toes and 4 1/2 inches at the heels. The stride measured 3 feet from the toe of one foot to the heel of the next step. Each foot has 5 toes. A humanlike large toe on the inside of the step and each toe following being smaller than the last. There is an arch to both  showing it is not flatfooted. I took these samples to the Univesity of Alabama and showed them to a professor who is an anthropology professor in forensics. I walked away disappointed to hear him insist that what I had were Bear tracks. But he had been on a bear trip since I had spoken to him a few days prior about my find. When I arrived at his office  before he even looked at the cast he was talking bears and showing me books and pictures of bears and bear tracks.  I tried to say Bears don  t have a Big toe  but he tried to make up reasons that these tracks of a  bear  had a big toe.  I realized this person was not going to believe what he was looking at was not a bear. It either frightened him to think it was a possible Bigfoot out there or he was embarassed to say he didn  t know what it was. Just a  Bear .  Well there is our encounter of a Track sighting.  When I was looking through the internet for sighting reports in the Alabama area I was excitedly surprised to find the one on your sight (report#245 Class A) which is in the same general area as ours. ,Withheld at witness request ,Tuscaloosa,4,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1125,yes
17,Was driving home at night about 9 00 pm. Turned on Bone Camp road from highway 171 and saw a large figure standing in the brush. As I turned on my brights it had taken off in the brush. This is the second time I  ve seen this thing and a friend of mine who lives on Bone Camp has also seen it as well as finding strange tree formations and randomly snapped limbs. ,Take 171 from Northport  and Bone Camp is a right turn about 3 miles up. ,Tuscaloosa,4,Alabama ,AL,Spring ,1125,yes
18,It was around the year of 1990 or so. I was about 10 years old and i was outside playing with my dog and the area behind her pen was very wooded at the time and as i looked up behind the pen  there was a very large creature standing right at the back of the fence of her pen. It stood there staring at me. It was solid white and had long hair covering it  s body. It stood to be about 7 to 9 feet tall as i can remember  judging now by the trees and fence. As i seen this  i turned and started running down the hill in our yard and my brother was putting a radio in his car and he said that i was as pale as a ghost when he seen me. I was very scared  not knowing what this thing was. When he looked where it was  it was no longer there. ,Near Strip Pits and Highway 118. ,Walker,13,Alabama ,AL,Spring ,1127,yes
19,Back in 1990 i was having predation problems on some property i was leasing. something was killing and eating my chickens i was raising. so me and my friend bj decided to doa little varmit hunting. we set up in some tall sage grass in the field behind my home about 300 meters away. it was late evening and we got into position to do some calling with a fawn distress call i had brought along. we called on and off for several minutes with no results. so we decided to wait until just before dark to try again. we got to sitting there just listening and noticed something was walking just inside the woodline directly in front of us about 150 meters away. it had the rhythm of something bipdial not fourlegged. we were upwind so i waited to see what or who it was. it got so dark that couln  t see mpre than 25-30 meters so we decided to call it quits for the day. when we got upbj shined his 6 cell light at the woodline and we caught a glimpse of something stepping back and stopped looking back where it had came  about then we hears the same series of sounds and the deer rather than go back ran within 20 feet of us in the opposite direction. over the next few months there were no more sounds so we put it in the back of our minds and forgot about it. deer season came and we decided not to hunt the area alone but to go ahead a the same stench as the night months before and the closer we got to the place where the deer had been it got worse. upon arriving the deer was gone you could see where it had lain but it was nowhere to be found. there were no drag marks in the leaves so whatever had moved it had lifted it from the ground and carried it. there are no known predators here larger than coyotes or bobcats. the deer weighed around 100-125lbs so whatever it was was large. this all occured 1 1/2miles southeast of nauvoo alabama on property owned by greg b. ,1 1/2miles southeast of Nauvoo Alabama. ,Walker,13,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1127,yes
20,I was driving south on Hwy. 45 just south of the Mississippi state line not very far into Alabama. I was driving my 18 wheeler and it was about 8 p.m. I had my brights on and a car was approaching so i dimmed the lights. After the car had passed by I turned the brights back on... I couldn  t believe at first what I saw. I had never heard of a blonde bigfoot but there it was. It was 7 feet tall or so and crossed a clearing in the woods that was at least 15 feet wide in two steps with a normal stride not running  just out for a stroll. It never looked my way. This took place in Fruitdale Alabama on a Friday night in February of 2008. I have learned that this creature has been seen for years close to this area. ,South on Hwy. 45 ,Washington,54,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1129,yes
21,I was driving home from work in the afternoon and completely preoccupied with thoughts of my struggles. When my eyes caught something. However my mind was still not focused other than I was waiting for movement of sorts. Itâ€™s second nature to keep a eye out for deer in this area. When I finally noticed that I was looking at  something unusual.  I saw a tall hairy animal walking off into the woods (on two feet) from the road. It had long blonde to light brown hair all over. I never saw the face. I kept my eyes focused on the woods where it walked into. When I reached that spot I was completely shocked at the size that creature was. It had to be at least 9 - 10 feet tall. The only thing I could think of was Bigfoot. Note  I have never been a believer of Bigfoot before but what I saw that day is something I canâ€™t stop thinking about. ,This location is just north of the â€œY.â€ This is the intersection of Hwy 45 and Hwy 17. It is a wooded area with only an older house that has been vacant as long as I can remember sitting just north of the sighting. There are no other buildings that I know of in the area. ,Washington,54,Alabama ,AL,Spring ,1129,yes
22,First  my friend Mike and I  along with two girls  were at the city park and heard it from bellow from the hill behind us. Three days later we went back again and this time I saw it. I thought it was a tall pole but it looked to be wavering in the breeze that was blowing. I called Mike over to look but it wasn  t there. Then it caught my eye. We saw it walking up the hill where we had heard it earlier. My second sighting was at our family farm  three miles away from the first sighting. I and my friend Bill rode out to the farm that evening to check on things since nobody lived in the house there. As we turned into the driveway the headlights swung  and there it stood  stepping over a 5 strand barb wire fence. It had its hands on the top wire and was swinging its leg over. Its eyes glowed in the light like an animals. We left in a hurry. ,In and around Aliceville  AL.  in Pickens County. Both my sightings were near Lubbub Creek  which runs into Dead River and from there to the Tombigbee River. ,Pickens,4,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1107,yes
23,My husband has described a hairy biped that has been seen by him on at least 2 occassions  and by his father on one occasion on Brindley Mountain in Morgan County Alabama. This biped is well known to residents of this side of the mountain. I have always been sceptible  thinking perhaps they are seeing bears or such. My husband is a seasoned outdoorsman however  and he rarely mistakes wildlife. In summer of 99  my husband was clearing land for a family member close to the bluff where sightings were reported off and on. I was sitting on a car watching him in a tree  (hes a tree surgeon). I happened to look off toward the tree line for no reason that I recall  and I saw perhaps several hundred feet off  a tall reddish manlike creature with no apparent neck  standing off in the shadows of the treeline. I looked up at my husband and gestured toward the area. Upon looking back  the creature was gone. My husbands nephew was also sitting next to me  and he saw the same thing I saw. I still to this day wonder what in the world I saw. I know bear  having seen many  and having travelled out west  and this was no bear. Since that incident  my husband was hunting  and he and his father saw from their tree posts the same creature. He would have to tell you the details. He has had I believe one other sighting  but there are many accounts within his family and surrounding neighbors on the bluff. I have heard screams late at night around 2 or 3 am  that no one can match them to any certain animal. They are very similar to sound files we have heard online. Very much like a bobcat/hounddog combo. It is like a howl scream very loud and drawn out. We continue to watch for further evidence  but have not had or heard of any activity for a couple of seasons to date. ,Off of Hiwaay 231South  out of Huntsville towards Arab.

24,My mother and I were en route to Mobile AL from Boothville  LA. It was approximately 2 A.m. We left Interstate 10 travelling north towards the Dawes community where my mother grew up and most of our family still reside.  We crossed the smaller of two bridges in close proximity to one another when we saw what we first thought must be a VERY large dog sitting in the opposite lane of the road. As we approached we saw the creature was sitting on haunches as a dog would but was face to face with us in the car ( an 80  s model pontiac parisienne). It showed no fear and did not so much as budge as we passed it  it did turn it  s head and watch us as we drove by. Unlike a dog the creature had a human like face that was the only part of its body not covered in long reddish brown hair. Even seated on its haunches the creature was about the height of an average man. It was more slender in build than the average  Bigfoot  we have seen portrayed in reports of sightings in the northern part of the US.  We don  t want to say this was a bigfoot but after watching a special on the history channel my mother and I agree that the similarities are enough to contact you and see what you think. We would like to add that local legends about the  Grand Bay Wolfman  are numerous and we heard stories about the   hairy  man monster   that likes to sit on bridges at night our entire lives  but up until we saw this thing for ourselves we never took them seriously. ,traveling north from the Grand Bay exit of I-10 towards Dawes Road  just over the small bridge ,Mobile,1,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1097,yes
25,A LONG STORY HERE. IT IS NOW MARCH 3  2007.  I LIVE IN GUNTERSVILLE ALABAMA. I HAVE SPOKE TO SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES JUST AS CONVERSATION. THE STORY IS THIS.  ABOUT 15YRS AGO  MY WIFE  AND TWO CHILDREN WERE LEAVING OUR HOME IN HONEYCOMB  JUST NORTH OF GUNTERSVILLE OFF OF HWY. 431 AT THE BOTTOM OF GRANT ALABAMA. WE WERE IN ROUTE TO WAL-MART. ABOUT 8-9PM PROBABLY MID SUMMER. A WELL LIT SEEMS FULL MOON NIGHT. WE LIVED 4MI. AROUND PAST THE LAKE IN HONEYCOMB. I WAS DRIVING MY OLD HOT-ROD A 1964 FORD. THERE ARE SOME PERSONS BY THE LAST NAME OF (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) WHO ALWAYS HAVE DOGS IN THE STREET AT THEIR HOUSE BY THE LAKE. THE ROAD WHITE ELEPHANT RD. RUN BY THE WATERS EDGE IN FRONT OF THEIR HOME. THE ROAD IS ABOUT 4FT OFF OF THE SHORE LINE. THE (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) S HAD TWO ST. BERNARD DOGS ALONG WITH THEIR OTHER DOGS. THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT DRIVING PAST I SAW IN THE WATER WALKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD AND SHORE A LARGE 8  SASQUACHE. I LOOKED BACK IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR  AND STILL TURNED AROUND TO LOOK THRU MY BACK GLASS. MY WIFE SAW MY DISMAY  AND QUICKLY ASK WHATâ€™S WRONG  SHE AT THAT TIME LOOKED BACK  I ALWAYS DRIVE SLOW BY THEIR HOUSE AS THE DOGS ARE ALWAYS IN THE ROAD  SO SHE HAD TIME TO LOOK  ALL SHE SAW WAS THE RIPPLES IN THE WATER  AS WE PASSED A FEW TREES. IT WAS A FULL MOON NIGHT  AND NO WIND-CALM WATERS. NOW WHAT I SAW WAS THE 8   SASQUATCH CARRYING ONE OF THE ST. BERNARD HEADS. I IN THE TIME THAT DROVE BY SLOWLY SAW THE BIGFOOT FROM THE KNEES UP  CARRYING THE HEAD OF THE DOG  SOME FLESH WAS HANGING FROM THE NECK AREA. THE HEAD WAS IN THE BIGFOOT  S LEFT HAND. HE WAS CARRYING IT FROM THE DOG HAIR AT THE TOP OF THE DOG HEAD. I SAID TO MY WIFE AT THAT TIME THAT IF ONE OF THOSE DOGS CAME UP MISSING THAT THE SASQUATCH WAS THE REASON WHY. HOWEVER BOTH DOGS CAME UP MISSING AND WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN AFTER THAT TIME. NOW STORY UP TO DATE.  TELLING THE STORY TO MANY PERSONS IN THE YEARS PASSING  AS PEOPLE TELL STORIES  I FINALLY TOLD THE GUYS AT THE TVA WHERE I WORK AS A CONTRACTOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT. MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) IS JUST KNOWING EACH OTHER FROM THE WINDOW OF OUR VEHICLE AS WE WOULD WAVE TO ONE ANOTHER  AS OUR CHILDREN ROAD THE SCHOOL BUSS WITH EACH OTHER. I FINALLY ONE DAY ABOUT 4YRS AGO ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS DOGS  AND TOLD HIM THE STORY  OF WHAT I SAW. HE SAID ONE OF THE DOGS DIED IN HUNTSVILLE ALABAMA AT HIS MOTHERS HOME  AND THE OTHER DIED AT HIS HOME IN HONEYCOMB AND HE BURIED IT BEHIND HIS HOUSE. NOW. I DIDN  T PUSH THE ISSUE OF LETTING ME DIG UP THE DOG  S CORPS AS IT WOULD BE KIND OF TACKY. BUT IF YOU GUYS WANT TO CONTACT ME AND SEND SOME INVESTIGATORS TO CHECK AND SEE IF MR. (NAME REMOVED BY INVESTIGATOR) WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DIG UP THE CORPS TO SEE IF ITS HEAD IS MISSING  YOU MAY GET SOME CLUES OR EVEN SOME HAIR FORM THE SASQUATCH. HOWEVER IF THE HEAD IS STILL ATTACHED  THEN I WAS HALLUCINATING THE WHOLE THING  AND MY WIFE WOULD JUST IMAGINED THE WATER RIPPLES TOO. I DONâ€™T DO DRUGS  OR SMOKE DOPE  AND DIDN  T AT THAT TIME EITHER.  THE ONLY THING RUNNING THRU MY VEINS IS GOOD WHOLESOME NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD.

26,I was walking home from fishing  taking a different trail. As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5 00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn  t long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn  t sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there  I just closed the door and didn  t say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon  my wife went to church at 6 00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later  I was laying on the couch watching TV  when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking  it looked at the ground. Understand this though  I had clear plastic on my window to keep heat in from winter.(Hadn  t taken it down yet.) When it got to the window  I had already laid back down on the couch  looking up and lay still. It looked down at me and kept walking  hopefully. I laid there for about as long as I could stand maybe a minute. Then I got off the couch by sliding on the floor  went and got my gun walked back in the living room and waited a minute  then went outside making all noise I could. I checked the back of the trailer  nothing there. Details of Bigfoot is as follows  he was about 7ft. tall maybe 7ft.3 . Solid black  no white or brown that I could see. Remember the plastic. His head was more rounded and not cone shaped. I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that. He was broad shouldered and thinner around the waist than what you usually see in the pictures and he walked more upright  not humped over like a gorilla. His hands hung around his thighs. The next morning around 10 00am.  I got up from bed as I worked 2rd. shift then. My wife told me a friend of mine had come down to see me. I asked what did he want. She said she only saw him as the top of his head went across the kitchen window. We had to set the trailer on 4 blocks high and 3 on the other end  which meant you could not see anyone walking in front of the trailer  not out the kitchen window anyway. I told her my friend was 6  4  and with a hat on you could not see him the way she had told me. We lived on rocky ground but I had one dusty dirt spot at the end of the trailer. Hoping he had walked in it. I checked and in the middle was a footprint. It was about 12 and a half inches long and 3 and half to 4 inches wide at the heel. Being dust it was only 1/4  deep. There were only 3 toes which I did not  understand at the time. I told some friends at work and one came to see it. The following Friday or Saturday night  he and a friend of his came over  no drinking sorry. And I told them the whole story. My friend was not hard to convince but his friend started talking big. So I told them let  s go outside. Joking around to see how brave he was when we heard two dogs about medium to small size started barking and chasing something on the other ridge behind my trailer. Which was not far at all  maybe 200yds. They chased it into the small valley about 50yds. south of us. When one dog quit barking  the other gave one more then it was quiet. Stunned  we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us. It stopped about 80yds. from us and started to hit a tree with something that sounded like a branch about 4 to 5 inches thick. Then it ran closer to about 40yds. and done the same thing again. By this time all bravery was gone. I went back in the trailer and got my gun. Come back out and asked if anything had happened. The brave guy thought he might had seen something in the shadows south of us  light was on of course. They took the gun away from me and I didn  t mind  thinking I had a way of escape. But we heard nothing else. My nearest neighbor is about 250 yds. away.( Mother-in-law) No one else for at least a mile. No reason to mess with us that I could even think of. That was the last I have seen or heard of him. ,Winchester Rd. out of Huntsville AL. to Buddy Williamson Rd.  North of Newmarket to Old Limestone Rd. ,Madison,38,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1089,yes
27,We was walking through the woods in Tuskegee  Alabama in the Tuskegee National Forest going duck hunting  while we were walking we stopped for a quick minute to rest and i looked up and seen something flash before my eyes  as we got to our destination at the swamp. We looked to our left and saw something walking accross the beaver dam. We do not believe it acknowledged our prescence. We would describe it as a tall  wide  black from head to toe creature walking upright on two legs trying to quickly get in to the woods. Also looked like as if he were carring a large object in one hand. It was time to go after that. The hunt was over. ,GO I85 to Auburn AL Exit 51 go south on 29 about 15-20 miles to Tuskegee National Forest hang right on dirtroad directly before onramp to hwy.80.Go straight up dirtroad hang second left go to top of hill and park in front of dirt mound on the right follow trail to swamp. ,Macon,11,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1087,yes
28,When I was about 8 or 10 yrs old  I saw a Bigfoot. It was on Green mountain near Huntsville  Ala. It was unpopulated then. Now there are million dollar homes there. I was on my way home from my uncle  s house on a gravel road. I was on one side of a hill. The road went down this hollow and back up the other side. In the ditch line was Bigfoot  about 8 ft. tall with arms that looked like they reached down past his knees. It was slightly leaned foward looking straight at me. It scared the daylights out of me. So I went back to my uncle  s house and told him. He got his shot gun and we went back. It was still there looking at us. Uncle threw up the gun to shoot and I told him we needed to get closer. So we went down the hill and as we did we lost sight.  When we got back up the other side it was gone.  ,In Huntsville. Just ask where Green Mountain is. ,Madison,38,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1089,yes
29,One evening my wife and I decided to go to my hunting club property to a place where we used to go sit and talk. We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing  and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact  so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream. I had parked my truck on the hilltop  and we sat on the tailgate facing the stream. Around 11 00 pm we heard a very loud snorting noise coming from the bottom of the hill  and the sound of brush moving and breaking. I thought that it was a wild hog  because they are plentiful in this area  so I told my wife to get in the truck  because I was afraid it would attack us. She got in the truck while I tried to find my flashlight and my gun. When she slammed the door  I heard a loud  low growl/grunt and it sounded like something large started running up the hill towards us. I was standing in the bed of my truck by now trying to shine my light down the hill  but the batteries were weak and I couldn  t see very far.There was a very bright moon out so I turned off my light  and could see a large shadow moving around about halfway up the hill towards us. I was listening to it move around and make the same growl/grunt noise. I could also hear what sounded like breathing noises. I then caught scent of a strange  musky  sour odor and heard more brush breaking and what sounded like stomping noises. I was certain by now that this was not a wild hog  but couldn  t figure out what it might be. So I told my wife to start my truck and rev the engine a few times and when she did  I heard what sounded like something crashing through the brush heading down hill and moving fast. We were both a little spooked by now so we left. As I pulled out onto the dirt road off the power line trail  I turned toward the bridge that crosses the small stream (the road roughly parallels the power line) a large number of deer ran at high speed across the road heading away from the stream. I tried to convince myself that it was just deer that I heard but couldn  t explain the shadow I saw. ,Moved to private investigatiors section. ,Lee,19,Alabama ,AL,Spring ,1081,yes
30,The creature had its back to the road and was squatted down picking at something in the grass or picking through the grass for something. Acted as though it wasn  t concerned with us passing by. ,On Waterloo Road going towards Waterloo  after you pass Gravelly Springs  you will pass a Church on the right side of the road. After that you will pass 2 houses I think and a small hill. This sighting took place just past that hill but was on the left side of the road. There was no mobile home there at that time   just a cow pasture. ,Lauderdale,6,Alabama ,AL,Spring ,1077,yes
31,This is NOT a joke  I  m well known here married to a funeral home director my brother n law is a law enforcement officer. I saw it clearly crossing the road right in front of me  I  m 6  4  so is my brother n law this creature was considerably taller than me probably 6  8  shuffling like an orangutan but more human-like but not like a man. It was covered in long hair maybe 4-6 inches long. It was not walking but not running... quickly shuffling. The most distinguishing feature was its arms  slump shouldered and its hands were below its knees. Now here is the deal  I don  t drink I don  t do drugs  I  m 55 yrs old as of May this year  have three grandbabies and two sons. I  m a christian and have NEVER  EVER  believed in bigfoot. I don  t know what this was but i do know this.... it was NOT human  no costume but not 100 percent animal. I SAW IT CLEARLY MYSELF.  Please take this seriously! I don  t care if you contact me personally or not but please check this thing out there is something out there i saw it myself. Is it  bigfoot  I  ve no idea but its something... thank you for your time ,Co. Rd 9 Lamar County Alabama ,Lamar,4,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1075,yes
32,In the early fall of 1979  my cousin and I were following some trails through the woods near my home.  These were trails that myself as well as the other neighborhood kids frequented often on bikes as well as foot.  It was a sunny day and warm.  After going approxiametly 60 yards into the woods I looked up onto a hill that was to the left of the trail that we were traveling on.  There standing  looking directly at us  among some small pine trees  was a very large being.  It was standing straight up on two legs  it was huge  at least 7ft tall  covered with medium brown hair.  It was standing as if frozen  I can still picture its arms and hands for some reason;  his hands were just like a man  s except larger and covered with hair.  It  s face was not totally covered with hair.  I froze in place and whispered to my cousin  what is that? .  She thought I had seen something on the ground she was not looking on the hill.  I just took off running as fast as I could toward the road  out of the woods.  When we were a good distance away I then told my cousin what I had seen and later we returned with a stick and large rock in hand but there was not sign of it.  There was also nothing on that hill that could have been construed as being anything like I saw. ,Just off Hwy 31  Warrior Exit ,Jefferson,56,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1073,yes
33,Saturday morning  12/1/2012  as I was getting my deer hunting gear out of the truck at around 4 30 a.m. and about to head down the trail in the dark I heard a tree knock not too far away. So Terri (my wife) and I went back there the next afternoon to do our own Bigfoot research and also so I could further investigate some good deer sign (a lot of food for Bigfoot) and mark a few locations for future deer hunting. We no sooner left the truck and started down the mountain on an old logging road and I glanced up and to the left and there he was a couple hundred yards away just standing there partially behind a tree watching us. We got a very eery feeling and as we were trying to figure out what to do next we looked back up there and it was gone. Needless to say our walk was over and we hurredly went back to the truck and got out of there. ,Skyline Wildlife Management Area  Buffalo Point ,Jackson,47,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1071,yes
34,My wife and me and our two children were coming home from my aunts house between 3 and 4 am. It was very foggy. We were within a couple miles from home when she spotted what she said was a very broad creature that stood on two legs and I became really excited when she said what stuck out to her the most was the figures cone shaped head and the way the hair shined when the lights hit it. I am still angry with myself because I was asleep on the passenger seat. She says the creature had its back to the road and disappeared when we went past it. She franticly explained to me what she saw when we got home and being the Bigfoot enthusiast I am jumped in my car and returned to the spot but didn  t see anything. ,west from Newville on CR 73 ,Henry,7,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1067,yes
35,Either December 25 or 26  2002. Franklin County Alabama Pine Forest/Hardwood Forest/Open field Between 4 00 and 5 00pm. I was hunting along a fenceline late that afternoon when some deer came running out of a pine thicket  down the netwire fence row  and jumped over to where I was.  I was roughly 75ft from the fence when this occurred.  My jack russell dog saw them and took aften them. He often follows me hunting as this place is next to my house.  After chasing them for about 10 mins he comes back towards me when he suddenly stops  looks towards the pine thicket  lets out a weird yelp and takes off towards the house visibly something wrong.  I stood there and heard a noise and the deer that had ran by came back by as if something had spooked them again.  As they came back up the hill I heard what appeared to be a large animal coming from the thicket.  I thought it was another deer that had separated from the herd and was coming back to join up.  As I watched something on two legs appeared roughly 100ft from my position from out of the thicket.  It came down the fence line and went over the fence in the direction of the deer.  I could clearly see that it was on two feet and did not pay me any attention.  I watched it for less than a minute before it disappeared down the hill from me. Numerous hunters have reported seeing something of this nature around here before.  I sent in a follow up the other day to tack on to this story but was notified that you never received this story.  My other account happened last week.  It goes as follows. July 1  2006 that around the hours of 11pm to 12am I walked out on my front porch to encounter weird noises that closely resemble those on your website.  The sounds came from directly in front of my house down in a hollow on my neighbors land.  They lasted for roughly 3 or 4 minutes. My three dogs became agitated and seemed quite frightened when the noise started.  I myself became somewhat afraid and proceeded back inside. I would also like to inform you on a change in email addresses.  As you can see my address now is [removed by editor].

36,My first sighting was in December 2012. It was about 12 midnight and I was on my way home. It was raining  not to hard but steady. I was going down the highway through the country side and on each side of the road up ahead were guard rails with woody swamps on each side. My headlights lit up the reflectors on the guard rails all the way down them. About mid way down the rail I saw a black space  almost like a gap in the rail. Once I got a little closer I realized it was some type of animal. It looked hairy  and as if it were standing over the rail crossing it. But before I got close enough to see  it had went into the woods. But it was big and I honestly didn  t really know what it was  so I didn  t think much of it until  about a week or so ago. I was leaving my house heading to work  it was about 8 30 or 9 in the morning.There was a very lite rain. I pulled out onto the highway (same one I had the first sighting on) and as soon as I pulled out about 200 to 300 yards I saw something weird looking on the side of the road  something out of place. As I started down the road it slowly walked out on the highway and took its time walking across the road  then stepped over the guard rail (same one as first sighting). It did this with ease. It walked down the ditch and into the woods. At this point it was about 150 yards in front of me. Its pretty open where it walked out so I got an okay look at it  but it was still a couple hundred yards out. Things that caught my attention were the way it seemed to walk. It had short legs and a longer upper body. Its head stuck up away from the shoulders. The arms hung beside it and hands were nearly touching the knees. It was all black. At first sight I was just like  that  s a man  but the closer I got the more I realize how different it looked. How much bigger it appeared. Plus it came from the woods  walked across the road into a swampy area. With no cars or anyone around. It just seemed out of place to me. That  s what made me focus on more detail. You could tell it didn  t have clothes on because it was just one slick figure. Not baggy from jackets/ pants/ etc. Not to mention it was rainy and around 30 degrees that morning. Whatever it was  I had never seen and I hunt all the time in the woods. But I will say it was defiantly not a bear or any human I  ve ever seen before. This thing was big and it gave you a chill just seeing it. I  m going back tomorrow to see if I can find any hair that may of caught the rail or any tracks  just anything that catches my eye. I want to believe they are really out there and seeing this was amazing.

37,When my aunt was about 11 or 12 years old  she was helping her older cousin (Jerry) in the field at her aunt  s house in an area called  Screamer  in Henry County  Alabama.  It was a hot day  and after some time Jerry grew very thirsty and asked my aunt to walk up the road to the house and get him a glass of water.  My aunt then walked through the field back toward the dirt road leading to her aunt  s house.  Upon reaching the dirt road  she saw two creatures standing on the other side of the road.  She stopped and began slowly backing up  then stopped again.  She stood there looking at them  and they looking at her  for a minute or so  long enough for her to get a good look at them.  They were only around 10 feet away from her at that point - she on one side of the dirt road and they on the other.  She described them as standing next to each other.  One was  in her estimation  around 5 feet tall and the other was slightly shorter  around 4 feet tall.  She said that she got the impression that they were young.  She said that they were  real hairy  and completely covered in dark brownish black hair  that they looked sort of like gorillas but with human looking faces with hair on them  human looking hands  and human looking feet.  She said their noses were free of hair and that the color of their noses was dark brown or black  as were their feet and hands.  They stood very still other than blinking  just looking at her.  Except for being covered in thick hair  their faces looked human with regular human-looking noses.  After a minute or so  she took off running as fast as she could back up to the house to get the water Jerry had requested.  She did not look back as she ran.  She got the water  and proceeded to walk back toward the field.  The creatures were not there anymore.  She never told anyone about this incident until just a couple of months ago because she was always afraid people would make fun of her. ,Specific instructions omitted for privacy reasons. ,Henry,7,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1067,yes
38,I was night fishing for catfish from a boat dock at the end of a dead end road adjacent to a wildlife refuge. It was middle of summer and the Mosquitoes were really bad so I decided to wait until after dark to go because they usually calm down after sunset. I had been fishing awhile with no luck when I started noticing something moving in the edge of the water  it was a river otter. I had never seen one before so I just sat and watched it for awhile. It was eating something maybe crawfish or muscles  I  m not sure but it was there for quite awhile. While watching it I started noticing large yellow eyes that I assumed was an owl. I would just catch a glimpse of them and when I would turn to look at them they would disappear. This went on for 30-45 minutes. All of a sudden the otter shot away from the bank and I saw something grey move from behind a bush to behind a cedar tree. The distance it covered was about 15 feet and it did it in a second and made no noise. I didn  t get a clear look it happened so quick  but whatever it was was big (if it was a side view like I assume from the direction of travel it was thick maybe 2 foot). Within 3-4 seconds after disappearing behind the cedar tree something big hit the water about 5 feet from the end if the dock where I was sitting and a fear came over me like nothing I  ve felt before. I grabbed my stuff  threw it in the truck and left as fast as I could. ,Clemons Road dead end at a boat ramp on a large peninsula on Guntersville lake in a wildlife refuge. ,Jackson,47,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1071,yes

40,On approx. January 5  2000  three friends and I decided to camp on one of my friend  s land.  We had two fourwheelers and a dog with us.  It was a rainy day and the ground of surrounding area was significantly wet.  We decided to camp anyway.  It stopped raining about dusk when my friend and I started to pitch the tent  while the other two went back to there house for some more supplies.  Mind you we were only camping about a mile from the road and one and a half miles from the landowner  s home.  About ten minutes after their departure me and my friend started hearing strange grunts  foul smell  and heavy footsteps. It went on for about ten minutes  with sounds getting closer and at random  as though the  animal  was trying to scare us or get us to make a move. It stopped when my friends arrived back and we dismissed as deer  spooked by our presence. We told of the incident to our friends and the landowner  s son explained that his dad had been experiencing  strange  occurences lately.  We went on with our camping and rode four-wheelers for about two hours. When we arrived back at camp  we decided to stay for the rest of the night. About ten minutes after arriving back  the same strange grunts and heavy steps began again. This time they were more aggitated and frequent. The sounds came within at least twenty yards of our camp. The area is heavily wooded so I could not see the animal at this time. The animal was across the creek at the beginning of the sounds and eventually jumped down into the creek  about a seven foot drop  and stayed there making grunts and heavy steps there for about five to ten minutes.  Being very frightened and defensive  I picked up about a ten pound rock and threw it in the vicinity of the animal below in the creek. I could not see the animal due to the foliage. It must have hit the animal because it gave a loud shriek and ran up the creek away from us  then jumping back up on the bank  a seven foot jump  and running back behind our campsite. It then proceeded to make very loud grunts and ran around the back of the campsite about twenty yards away in the woods out or our fire  s sight. It then stopped and we could hear it breathing heavily. Talking amongst ourselves and shouting at the animal  it then made the most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard. I would describe it as high-pitched and seemed to echo everywhere around us. I have heard bobcats and screech owls and can tell you this was not one.  We then proceeded to leave hasitly on our ATVs and went and got the father of my friend. He came back with us and stayed awhile with no occurences. He left and we somehow got ourselves to stay for the night. Nothing happened the rest of the night and we went to sleep. I awoke at 3am to the same grunts and heavy footsteps. This time they were very close. They lasted by my watch til 345am. Not awaking my friends in fear of the animal becoming aggressive  I laid there and listened to this animal. Afterwards  I laid there until sunrise and told my friends of the sounds and occurences of the night. They asked me due to my  as they described  pale face and rattled demeanor. We then went and looked for any evidence of the animal. We found locks of hair in the trees  approx. seven foot high  and numerous large footprints  similar to a humans  but with no arch and a very large great toe. We then proceeded to follow the footprints to where  amonst downed trees and foliage  we found where a large animal had been laying. We found hair there also. We continued to trail the animal  s leavings when came across the same sounds of footsteps. They were too scared to go over the hill and see the animal making the noise so they told me to. Reluctantly I did  and saw a large upright creature  approx. seven to eight feet tall  walking with its back to me. It was covered in hair  black to dark brown  and had an awful smell. It turned and alarmed by my presence ran away from me. I then turned and ran away from it towards my friends who I shouted to to run. They got up and ran and we ran back to our campsite and stayed there where I told them what I saw.  For a few months after that we heard the same grunts and shrieks down the creek where we camped that night. We frequently rode ATVs down there and an occurence was frequent. Occurences also happened at other places  two to three miles away from the area of occurence. A sighting was also reported at a park about a mile up the road from my house  three miles from the creek. We also found footprints in nearby rock quarry. My brother and I also saw a  brown  animal  who we thought to be a man at first  but  trailed him to find that could not have been a man  on hunting land a mile from our house. No occurences have happened in the past three years. But  I also don  t ride or camp as much  either. ,Near a creek that runs through the county called Phelps Creek. ,Lee,19,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1081,no
41,First of all I would like to say that I am a city girl and educated in medical science and not familiar with such things as Big Foot. I will say that I moved to Alabama 6 years ago  met and married my husband and he familiarized me with  the ways of the wild ...ie sounds  smells  woods  etc.  I learned as much about the outdoors as I could and visit them often to this day. The experience I am about to share occured in January 2007.  My husband belonged to a hunting club and we spent most of our free time enjoying waterfalls and creeks....looking at stars...sitting and talking  absolutely everything slips away when you go into the wild. We decided not to go to the hunting club this night  but to an old abandoned grave yard.  An elderly couple used to go there years ago and keep it clean from debris and weeds but since they died it is grown over. It seems to be such a peaceful place full of history and romance. We had been there often and this particular night my husband was  to say the least  enebriated  and we were just sitting in the car talking...the moon was very bright and the stars were all out.  I kept hearing branches breaking  to my left  I was in the driver seat of the car and my husband was in the passenger seat.  I thought it was probably a rabbit or another critter of the night...but I started to get a very creepy feeling...as if I was being watched...I felt this for a time before my husband asked me why I was looking to my left constantly.  I simply said I feel like I am being watched and shrugged it off.  The feeling did get stronger and I continued to look to my left into the surrounding woods to find out exactly what was giving me this eerie feeling.  This went on for quite a while...I also noticed a foul odor but could not pin point it  s source..I thought it was my husbands usual bout of  well to put it delicately  indigestion...I eventually saw a very tall figure and told my husband that someone was in the woods and he was standing between two tall pine trees...He thought I was crazy and laughed it off...I never stopped looking and saw this figure sway from side to side...from tree to tree..never approached...never made a sound.  I looked for about 5 or 10 minutes before I was just too scared to stay there anymore  so we left.  A similar experience happened to my husband 5 years ago right after I moved here. It is currently posted on this site. I have been encouraged by Mr. M. Collins to post my experience..throughout this experience my husband never witnessed what I saw. He says he could not see anything out in the dark because of the glare of the dashboard lights (we had the radio on low). I am not sure what exactly I did see...I just know that I have frequented these woods for years and have never felt like that before...I do not intimidate easily and I was extremely ready to leave that night. I have gone back to the graveyard  but not nearly as often as before the incident. I am always on guard there.  I know I saw something and I don  t believe it was a man. ,Take Hwy 29 East from Interstate 85  The area is near Halawakee Creek in Lee County  Alabama and is between Hwy 29 and Hwy 280 East. ,Lee,19,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1081,yes
42,The main sighting  as I wish to refer to it here  took place in Limestone county along Elk Creek. It occurred in the spring of 1978 or 79. I cannot seem to recall eactly since it has been many years ago. I  m in my early 30  s now but  at the time of the sighting I was 13 or 14. I was on an annual family visit to my Grandparents place in Athens. We had gone out to  the River  for a few days. I can  t recall what day it was but I do remember that is was in the early afternoon. I was a typical kid then so naturally I was doing kid stuff. I had a Frog gig and I was downat the boathouse pier throwing it into the shallow water trying to randomly hit something in the water. ( I did nail a Crappie but  I did not hurt it bad so I let it go). At the end of the slew was a swampy area. This area started approx. 175 to 250 yards from my Grandparents cabin. It was shallow water and several hardwood trees such as Oak or Dogwood  for example  growing within the swamp. The swamp went back perhaps a few miles. (No one in my family nor myself  except maybe my Grandfather  had ventured too far into that swamp). Along the sloping bank from the cabin to the swamp were 3 other cabins with piers. Across from the cabins is a gentle sloping pasture  next to it are a couple of cabins and boathouses. It seems that every time I was at the boathouse and I looked across the water there were always cows in the pasture. However  that day I just let the Crappy go and I happened to look out toward the swamp. As i did I noticed something emerge from the swamp  next to and below the pasture fence about 50 feet  and wade into the water of the slew. It was dark in color  black I think ( this I know because it was a sunny day)  it stood upright. It had waded into the water  knee  deep. I did not really pay attention at first thinking it was a Bear. However  I looked again a few seconds later and soon realized it was not a bear. It was tall  approx. 8 or 9 feet  well built  and very hairy. I could not make out any facial features due  to the distance  I did not notice a neck and the head was round shaped. The animal proceeded to look both ways  it then bent over at the waist and took its left arm and swung it into the water. I noticed the splash. The animal did this twice. It then stood up and looked straight in my direction. It stood there a few seconds then turned around and walked back into the swamp just like a person would. I stood there and just of shrugged my shoulders and went back to messing around. About 3 or 4 minutes later I looked back toward the swamp again and the creature came back out from the same spot that it had before. It waded  knee  deep into the water once again and did the exact same thing over that it had done before  including looking my direction once again. It then turned around and wandered back into the swamp in the same area it had come out of. It did not come back out again  for I stayed at the pier for about another hour and I keep looking that-a-way several times. To this day I am convinced that it was trying to catch fish. I never felt I was in any danger even though it was an odd experience. However  being at that age I did not want to go outside alone after dark for any reason including to use the bathroom. ( The cabin bathroom was in the basement and one had to get to it by going outside). It took me a few years too be comfortable there at night. In regards to that sighting there was something I noticed  there were no cattle to be seen in the pasture at the time of the sighting! The funny side to all this is that I had carried a pair of binoculars down to the pier with me and left them sitting next to me on the upper rail. Not once did it occur to me to pick them up and use them! A side note Two weeks earlier two boys had found large human like footprints in that region somewhere as reported in a local newspaper. About ten years ago my Grandmother sold the place. However  I was in Athens a couple of years ago so I drove out to  the River  too see the old place. No one was there so I took the liberty of walking downto the pier and boathouse. Except for a new paint job on the cabin and a refurbished boathouse nothing had changed over the years. The slew and swamp were still the same. I remained for an hour picking up fossils since the water was down  it being late summer. During that brief time I looked toward the swamp periodically remembering  wondering  and well  kind of hoping. ,The main sighting report I leave here happened in Limestone Co.

43,I WAS 17 YEARS OLD  IAM 24 NOW. IT WAS LATE SUMMER  AND MY GIRLFRIEND  S PARENTS HAD GONE OUT FOR THE NIGHT AND HAD ASKED ME TO STICK AROUND AND LOOK AFTER HER AND HER YOUNGER BROTHER. I LIVE 5 MILES WEST OF ELKMONT AL AND 1.5 MILES SOUTH OF THE ELK RIVER. I WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM AND HAD JUST GOT OFF THE COUCH WHERE ME AND HER LITTLE BROTHER WERE SITTING TO LOCK THE FRONT DOOR. I WENT TO THE BATHROOM. I CAME BACK OUT AND SOMETHING JIGGLED THE DOOR KNOB I HAD JUST LOCKED 1.5 MINUTES BEFORE I WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

AFTER THE CALL WAS MADE  I STEPPED OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH A FLASHLIGHT AND MY SHOT GUN TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION. THE MOON WAS FULL AND I NOTICED AN OBJECT STANDING IN THE FIELD BEHIND MY HOUSE. AT THE TIME THE WEEDS IN THE PASTURE HAD GROWN UP BECAUSE OUR TRACTOR WAS BROKE DOWN. I AM 6 FEET TALL AT THE TIME AND THE WEEDS WERE OVER MY HEAD. I SHINED MY LIGHT TOWARD WHAT I HAD SAW IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON AND SAW A CREATURE THAT TOOK THE SHAPE OF A HUMAN BUT WAS MUCH TALLER AND MUCH LARGER IN SIZE THAN A HUMAN. IT WAS AN OFF-WHITE COLOR AND HAD VERY LARGE AND WELL DEFINED MUSCLES. I DROPPED MY LIGHT TO DRAW AIM ON THE CREATURE  AND RAISED MY LIGHT TO FIND THE CREATURE GONE. I TOLD THE POLICE WHAT I HAD SEEN AND THEY TOLD ME THAT MY MIND WAS PLAYING TRICKS ON ME. I WAS VERY ANGRY AND WENT DOWN TO WHERE I HAD SEEN THE BEAST AFTER THE COPS HAD LEFT. THE WEEDS WERE AL MASHED DOWN. I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THIS WAS NOT THE LAST TIME I WOULD SEE THE CREATURE. I HAVE SAW IT AT HANNAH-WARD BRIDGE  AND HAVE SAW IT ON SULPHUR CREEK.

45,I was staying at the Marriott hotel 6th floor in Huntsville Alabama at the Space and Rocket Center-At 5 40am on Feb 24th 2009 I went on the balcony to drink my coffee as the room was too stuffy and hot.  I was out there just thinking and staring off at the woods when something caught my eye--after refocusing on it I realized there were legs  then arms  then I could clearly make out his face.  The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips  eye lids  etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect  was very muscular  and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side.  After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6  4  300 lbs.  I went back after 7am (light) -- I did notice what looked like scat --it took the form of explosive diarrhea and looked like a hundred birds had pooped in a small area--like in a shotgun pattern-heavy in the middle and lighter to the outside perimeter-I put a large handful in a Marriott laundry plastic bag--It looks like feces and digested berries and seeds. (It was dry although it had rained the night before)  One of the Marriott employee  s saw two large footprints --more like deep indention  s in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention  s--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not.  I am 100% positive of the above discription--I watched this clearly for 5-6 minutes! ,I was on 6th floor of Marriott Hotel facing the Rocket Center--(room 614)--creature was 30-35 yards from parking spaces where the loading docks and dumpster area is if you are facing hotel it will be the area to  the left where there is a walking trail ,Madison,38,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1089,yes

47,My son has convinced me to contact you. I will tell your organization of our encounters. On November 28 2008 I was visiting a friends house in Lacey  s Spring Alabama. His house is in a small middle class  neighborhood with mountains and woods that stretch for miles behind his home. I woke up to use the bathroom at about 4 00AM and had just laid back down when I began to hear loud vocalizations. The sounds where very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi recordings. I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside. About the time I started to fall asleep it started again the howls lasted about 3 minutes. Then stopped I thought that it might be my friend snoring in the back bedroom but I don  t believe this was so because the neighborhood dogs where barking throughout the area in response to the howls. At this point I knew something outside was making the noise. I wanted to go into the woods for a better listen  but walking into the woods with no one in the know and not prepared for self defense or to photograph or record the creature did not seem like a wise proposition. The howling started and stopped 3 more times and finally finished at dawn. I talked with my son about what I had heard and he and I have also had a encounter with this animal in the past. ,off Hwy 231 south of Tennessee River. ,Morgan,17,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1103,no
48,My sighting happened last summer. I was kayaking down a creek. It was about the middle of the day. I was comin down the creek. The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I  ve seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn  t bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance. So I couldn  t see it. ,In the valley off of Greenbrier Cove Rd. close to the Tennessee river ,Morgan,17,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1103,yes

50,I was born and raised in Aliceville  Al. about a guarter mile from the City Park. In 1958 I was 14 years old. I played in the woods South of the Park and swam in the creek nearly every day.One afternoon just before dark I had been down near the creek at a small pond.This was before the City built sewer lagoon on that property. At that time there was a twenty or so acre sage brush patch there where they had not cultivated for years.That afternoon while walking from the lake back across the west end of that field I saw something walking a path along the eastern end.At first I thought it to be a huge man. That five foot tall sagebrush was strikeing hin about the waste.It was in plaine sight for about fifty yards and turned and went back into the woods. It must have been 8 ft. tall and walked with it  s head slightly bent forward  very dark in color. I could tell it was the same color from waste to the top of it  s head.The longer I looked I knew it wasn  t human.I ran home and told my parents but I don  t think they believed me.I never went in those woods alone again until I was much older.When a friend sent me your site on the net and I saw Aliceville on it I had to tell my story. ,The eastern dike of the East Lagoon ,Pickens,4,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1107,yes
51,I was probably 13 or 14 at the time.  I was riding my bicycle down a wooded trail in a relatively populated part of town.  A bigfoot jumped out in front of me  I fell off my bike and he stood over me  and howled/growled not  feet away from me. He then turned and ran through the woods away from me.  He was between 7 and 8 feet tall more on the skinny side but still big. Not groomed kind of mangy looking.  Longer than average arms and thick through the shoulders to the top of the neck.  I know what I saw.  I  m 42 now and have been called crazy all my life because I openly admit what I saw.  The sound it made could not be recreated by a person. ,Take I-65 north to Brewton/Repton exit.  Turn right on Hwy 41. ,Escambia,3,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1053,yes
52,I was assigned to Ft Rucker  AL from Oct 1991 until Jan 1997 as a fire fighter. As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker  I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian â€œrelicâ€ hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields  creek washouts  and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours. My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts  an old pair of army boots  a belt with a canteen  a pouch (for any finds)  a large survival knife  ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking. This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East  North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe Â¾ of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though  as I immediately got instant chillsâ€¦goosebumps running my entire bodyâ€¦and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large â€œshadowâ€â€¦easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see meâ€¦and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didnâ€™t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explainâ€¦a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again  and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse  which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before. Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day. The first being this. In 2000â€¦I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis  WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. Butâ€¦he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too closeâ€¦just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow  low voice telling it â€œIâ€™m not here to hurt you  just calm down  I donâ€™t mean no trouble for youâ€. He said that usually after he spoke towards it  it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that â€œBigfootâ€ was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone. So that got me to thinking  maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot. The second reason I feel that I didnâ€™t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. Soâ€¦I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was realâ€¦and not something else. I havenâ€™t shared this story with very many peopleâ€¦but maybe this is the time to do it. ,I have looked at some satellite images of the area and cannot pinpoint the exact spot just the area within a few hundred yards.

53,On January 23rd 2013 between 4 30 and 5pm while deer hunting I heard what I thought was a coyote making noise behind me but then I heard foot steps  loud foot steps coming toward me that  s when I saw what I can say was a bigfoot coming up the draw to my left about 70 yards away it came out of the draw and turned left and went away from me. The next morning my father and I went back out to where I saw the creature. I climbed into my ladder stand and my father went to the draw where I saw the creature and walked the same path and the creature I saw was at least 2 feet taller then my father my stands father 6 feet 4. ,On the Cullman Morgan county line. ,Cullman,2,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1043,yes
54,I was outside one morning with my daughter and we were picking up pecans in the yard under the trees.  After about 30 minutes I heard the sound of pigs squealing  screaming.  I looked up and peered through the trees to the wooded back yard of our nearest neighbor.  They had some pigs in a pen at the back of their yard just on the edge of the woods.  I looked in that direction and saw standing there at the edge of their pen  a creature much bigger than a bear or a man.  It was at least about 8 to 10 ft. Tall and was holding one of the baby pigs in its arms.  Holding it close to its chest.  It was hairy like a bear but had a human type face.  I froze and it froze and we both stared at each other  then somehow I thought of my daughter and her safety and I immediately grabbed her and ran inside screaming at my husband to get his gun  there was a Bigfoot outside.  I was hysterical and afraid.  My fear caused him to grab his rifle and run out to investigate.  Of course it was gone.  To this day my husband tells me it was a bear.  But I know better.  I know the difference between the face of a bear and a person  or something like a person. ,Caution light at the junction of Hwy 55 and Hwy 84 in River Falls was the nearest landmark.

55,In 1979 and   80 I was living in my grandparent  s old homeplace on our family farm in Alabama.  The farm has about 300 acres of woods covering an area of deep hollows leading down to sloughs off of a river. In late summer and fall of   79 we had been having trouble with deer poachers and some cattle rustling on our farm  so I was spending a lot of time out at night and on my off days trying to catch them.  Several times at night and a couple of times during the day I had heard strange screams back in the woods towards the river.  The first time I heard them  I thought it might be a peacock or a screech owl  but it really didn  t sound like either  and it seemed to be much louder and more prolonged. I really didn  t think much of it until one night I was walking back to the house from the back of the farm at about 11 00pm.  It was a clear night with a bright half moon shining and I could see quite well.  I was skirting along the south edge of the woods about 1/2 mile due north of the house when suddenly I got a creeping feeling that I was being watched and/or was in danger.  My skin started crawling and the hair on the back of my neck and hands stood up.  At the same time my dog  a large doberman pinscher  started acting nervous and whining quietly and started looking back over his shoulder to our left towards the woodline. I eased the safety off on my rifle and increased my pace.  Right at that instant  something screamed right in the edge of the woods less than 35 yards behind and to the left of us.  The pitch and volume of the scream was incredible.  I could feel my chest vibrating from the loudness of the scream.  My dog and I both broke and ran to our right out into the pasture about 50 yards and I spun around and stopped with my rifle up to see if it was chasing us  but it wasn  t.  I stood there with my rifle up and whatever it was screamed at us five or six more times.  Also I could hear movement in the dry leaves where the sound was coming from  that sounded like a large person pacing back and forth.  I could also see the tops of some saplings and small trees sway and move as it bumped into them or pushed and pulled on them. The screams were longer lasting and a little lower pitched than what I had heard before.  I also know for sure that they weren  t bobcat screams.  I became aware of the sound of our cattle running away towards the southwest.  The woods got quiet but I knew it was standing there still watching me.  But I never saw anything.  I backed away for about 100yds and then broke into a jog back to the house  spinning around and stopping with my rifle up about every 50 yards or so to make sure it wasn  t following me. A few nights later  I was up late about 1 30am and getting ready for bed.  I came out of the bathroom into my bedroom and my dog was standing there staring towards the front of the house.  He was completely stiff  with the hair standing up on his back and neck and he was growling very low and menacingly.  It was the ONLY time I ever saw him do that and he was deadly serious.  I got a glimpse of a shadow move across the corner of my front bedroom window moving towards the west side of the house. The moon was shining right on the west wall of the house.  My dog turned towards the west and kept growling even more seriously.  Then I saw a large  sort of human shaped shadow move across both windows on the west side of the house.  The dog kept turning and growling and following the shadow.  Whatever it was  had to have been about 10 feet tall to cast a shadow that far up on the windows.  I was petrified with fear. I finally picked up my riot shotgun and chambered a round of buckshot.  My dog  at this time  was staring towards the north window of the spare bedroom and was still stiff and but not growling quite as bad.  I got up enough nerve to look out the bathroom window but saw nothing.  My yard was surrounded by a 3 ft high  hog-wire fence with two strands of barbed wire on top of it and locked steel gates  so whatever it was  stepped over the fence to get into and out of my yard.  The gates made a lot of noise if you tried to climb or open them  so it didn  t come or go through the gates. In the next few weeks  while I was walking through the woods near the river  in two different locations  I found several deer that had been killed.  At the time  I thought that poachers had done it  but they were all complete except for having their abdomens cut or torn open and the guts pulled out.  None of the meat was gone from any of them  other than what possums or coons had eaten  and most of them had broken legs.  Only one was a buck and it was a yearling spike.  One of the deer had been killed right where I found it.  There were broken limbs and saplings and hair all around it.  There were tufts of deer hair hung in the bark of two larger trees next to the carcass.  Some of the tufts were over 10 feet off the ground.  Both of the deer  s back legs were broken and twisted.  Even then I thought that it looked like something had grabbed that deer by the back legs and beaten it to death against the trees. I didn  t tell anyone about any of this.  My dad and other folks had told me that people had been hearing and seeing strange things along that part of the river for decades.  But I had a neighbor that had told about seeing a bigfoot on his property a few years earlier and everybody laughed at him. In early fall of 1980  my wife was bringing in the wash one night about 7 00pm.  I had fed the horses some oats about 30 minutes earlier and I was now in the kitchen and suddenly heard a scream outside.  I ran out and my wife was running in  scared nearly to death. Something was right outside the gate between the storage shed and tack room/stables screaming just like before.  The horses went running out of there wide open.  The fence and gate there is quite high because there is a corral there also.  I could hear it moving around but could only get a glimpse of it occasionally.  It was MUCH taller than the 6 ft fence there and it appeared to be black with maybe a little silver or grey mixed in.  There  s a steetlight in our yard on that side of the house  and when it moved though a patch of light  I could see the light glint off of its fur.  It was tall enough that it hit or shoved aside some tree limbs that I have to jump to be able to touch.  It screamed several more times and I could tell that it was becoming more agitated.  Between screams  I could hear it making a very eerie strange noise with an intermittent clicking sound that sounded like it was growling as it chewed or moved its mouth.   I ran back in the house and locked the doors. We moved shortly after that and I spent hardly any time on the farm until we moved back to the area in 1997.  My son  daughter and I and a couple of friends were coon hunting on the back of the farm near the river last year (November 1999) and the dogs were down on the east side of a ridge and we were waiting up on the top of the ridge for them to tree.  We started to hear the same screams as before about 600 yards to the west of us  in one of the areas where I had found dead deer before.  The screams lasted maybe 30 seconds to a minute and then stopped. We had tried to get the dogs to go in that direction earlier  and they wouldn  t and we tried again later  but they kept circling back around and going to the truck  and these are championship dogs.  I didn  t get to go back in the woods there until April of this year (2000).  I found fresh deer bones in the area where I had found several dead deer 20 years before. After finding your website and reading about the bigfoot killing deer  I now know that it hasn  t been poachers killing all of our deer.  I believe that I will probably find more evidence of activity because the deer population is increasing in our area. . ,East of Muscle Shoals.

56,At the end of January 2013 I was traveling north on Alabama Hwy 51 in northern Coffee County in a rural area approximately one mile south of the Dale County line just before dark. I estimate the time to be around 5 PM. As I approached a left curve I noticed a large dark mass in the road way. At this point I was within one hundred yards of it. Suddenly it moved to my right and in about three steps it was on the shoulder of the road facing me. It was a bipedal creature approximately nine feet tall with a shoulder span approaching four feet with the most intense yellow-green eyes I  ve ever seen spaced six to eight inches apart. In my headlights I could see it was covered in grey-brown hair. The face was ape like with dark brown-black leathery skin. The creature lifted its left arm  possibly to shield its eyes or perhaps anticipating being hit as I was about thirty feet from it. Then I was past it. It took several seconds for the significance of what had occurred to sink in. ,Alabama Hwy. 51 in northern Coffee county  in a rural area  approximately one mile south of the Dale county line ,Coffee,2,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1031,yes
57,About 7 years ago my wife and I were at a lake in the middle of the talledega national forrest in Alabama.The lake was sweet water lake.We were fishing in a small boat at the end of a slew early in the morning we were the only ones at the lake  I think it was on a wendsday and we were all alone. We heard somthing scream  it started out as a howl and turned into a long high pitched scream and it was so loud it echoed through the mountians. It made the hair stand up on the back of our necks.But that is not all. About a year before that My stepfather and I were hicking around the same lake we liked to fish at a spillway way on the backside of the lake and about 1/2 mile into the hike we crossed a fire brake about 20 feet wide  now keep in mind that we are a pretty good way back in the woods we have crossed rocks thorns and bryers and all kinds of rough ground. And right there across the dried mud in the fire brake is a set of foot prints dried into the mud.they were not huge they were about the size of a full grown man but they did look human  I just couldn  t understand why a man would be this far back in the woods without shoes on.And over the years there is one thing I have thought about a bigfoot would have to grow up  so maybe it was a young bigfoot ,From I 20 you get off at the Heflin exit and go through Heflin and get on hwy 78.

58,01192008 Suspicious knocking was heard about 3 00 am as my husband was camping with  Boy Scouts  on the side of a ridge SE of Henderson Peak about 200 yds from State Rd. 281.  (topozone.com map 33Â° 27.85  N  85Â° 52.21  W - across road from red #13 about 200 yds. ) This is just south of the Cheaha State Park line.  It was about 14 degrees with intermittent howling wind.  There were 3 sets of 2 knocks each about 100 yards north of the campsite described as â€œa piece of firewood hitting another.â€  It was very loud and the knocks  though themselves rhythmic  were spaced so that the wind died down before they occurred again.   These were not little limbs hitting each other and he was not able to determine if there were any responses because of the wind.   There were no campers north of them and the only other campers on the mountain that were encountered was another Boy Scout troop camping about 4 miles away directly on Lake Chinobee.  My husband is an avid bfro.net browser (and hopeful member of a future BFRO expedition  -) who awoke and immediately felt that this was consistent with other knocking activity.  Due to the inclement conditions and not wanting to scare the younger kids in camp  he did not have a chance to follow up.  Although he didnâ€™t mention the sounds the next morning  another adult did  and with careful  roundabout questioning all other factors for the sounds were excluded (trees falling  wind  limbs hitting each other due to the wind  etc).  I am typing this since he was â€œnot sureâ€ of the cause of the sounds and was reluctant to report something that may not have been genuine (since he wasnâ€™t able to go look for tracks). ,(topozone.com map 33Â° 27.85  N  85Â° 52.21  W - across road from red #13 about 200 yds. )  This is in the Talladega National Forest on the Pinhote Trail SE of McDill Point and NW of Odum Trail  on the SE side of Henderson Peak (as pointed out by the Troop Leader). ,Clay,22,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1027,no

60,I was driving home from Cedar Bluff high school on Hwy 9 towards my house. As I was coming down the road I caught a glimpse of something at the edge of the wood line. I put on my brakes to get a better view and that  s when I saw what it was. It was about 7 to 8 feet tall. Dark hairy color and was standing on 2 legs. It stood and stared at me a few seconds and then turned and walked back into the woods. It took 2 strides and it was gone. I was freaked out!!!! I knew when I saw it  that it was a sasquatch.

61,I myself have never seen a bigfoot. But  I have two reports that were told to me. These both occurred in Blount county  Alabama. The first sighting was in 1975 about 2 miles from the Chamblee Mill bridge. A friend of mine had just dropped me off after football practice. He was driving home on the road that crosses the bridge  this area is located in a triangle between Blountsville  Hanceville & Holly Pond. He saw a large black or brown hairy figure stepping out of the woods as he was coming around a curve. He was startled and almost wrecked his car. His story later appeared in the Cullman Times  a paper in Cullman  Alabama. He later told me that he never was more affraid in his life. He looked it right in the eye and it stepped back in the woods. The location he saw it at is about a mile from my childhood home. The second sighting occurred on Skyball mountain some 2-3 miles from this sighting. My brother was driving alone on the road that crosses Skyball mountain. The area has very few homes on the mountain. There are streches of the road that are 2-3 miles before a house is located. The time was late evening around 11 pm or later in August 1991 or 1992. He had just topped a small rise on the road and began to smell a strong odor (he had his window down). He looked to the right of the road and saw a large dark figure walking through the tall weeds that were beside the road. He first thought it was a horse but it stepped out on the road. He described it as 8 feet tall  large  hairy  no neck  coal black eyes and covered in dark  brown or black hair. He said it looked dead at him and he stopped his car. He thought about putting car in reverse but instead just sat there looking at it. He said it must of stood there a minute or longer. It smelled awful  it had long arms and large dark hair covered hands. It just walked off in to the woods on the other side of the road and he drove home. ,These both occurred in Blount county  Alabama.

62,It was a hot afternoon in august. I heard sirens in the distance. the local rescue squad was responding to an incident. curious about what was going on I decide to go and see. when we arrived  I found out that 2 bham men had went canoeing and had not been seen since. the sherrif wanted to call for a helo to search the river. I piped up and told them that in was not a good idea. the trees cause a tunnel affect over the river. the helo wouldn  t be able to see under the growth. on top of that the sun was starting to go down. he agreed and sent 6 men in 2 canoes down the river. 30-45 minutes passed and we were told that they had been found at a local bar in b  ham. my friend and I volunteered to pull the rescuers out of the river at a mid point near the road. we set off. the light was almost gone. as we made our way down the trail to a place where the stream and the cahaba meet my friend took off ahead of me. he knew the area better and i could see his light moving ahead of me. as I entered the bottoms where a bamboo thicket grew  I heard brush breaking and grunting noises to my left. I quickley made my way across the stream. I felt much better and safer once I crossed the stream. as I rejoined my friend at the intersection of the stream and river  I told him about what I had heard. he said it was probably a boar rooting for acorns. we sat for about an hour waiting. the moon was out quarter waxing  and hot as hell 100% humidity 90 degrees. after waiting I said to my friend that we must have missed the rescue team in the night. so he went to find out and he left me there on the bank to make sure they were not just slow getting down the river. another 30 minutes went by and I started seeing a light up the bank approaching my position. I pulled myself up into the foliage to camo myself  just in case the light was moon shiners or pot growers. they are notorius for bibb county. minutes passed and I heard my name being called. I made my way back across the stream and through the thicket. the grunting and brush snapping sounds still happening. as I climbed up the hill to the large over hanging rock i paused to catch my breath holding onto the tree. all of the sudden something large much taller than myself( I am 6  8 tall) rushed me. more of the limbs breaking and a vocalization sound like an excited baboon and a fierce growl.

63,I have been reluctant to share my story because of my field of work  and do not want to have people think I am â€œcrazyâ€ as this could damage my career. But  as I get older  I feel this incident needs to be documented. The incident occurred in the winter of 1980 a few miles east of Clayton  Alabama in Barbour County. I was traveling with my Aunt  Grandmother and four younger cousins to a relativeâ€™s house. It was dark and probably around 9pm from the best I can remember. For some reason  my Aunt needed to turn around and proceeded to pull off the roadway by a small clearing. I was in the front seat of the car with my Aunt  who was driving  and my Grandmother. As we turned off the road  the headlights caught a figure in mid-stride. It then immediately froze and did not move anymore. It was about 30 yards from the car â€“ very close. I could see the entire side view of this creature and its body was slightly turned so that it was looking at us. The most terrifying thing in my memory is this things huge eyes glaring at us. The best way I can describe the creatureâ€™s expression is â€œstunned.â€ The face was covered in hair except for around the eyes. The hair was dark and appeared longer and wavy looking on the arms and legs. It was very tall and massive yet lean looking. I would say it was easily over 7 feet tall  if not more. When it â€œfrozeâ€ in the headlights  one arm was slightly extended behind the creature and it held this position. At this point  my Grandmother was crying and begging my Aunt to drive away. Two of my younger cousins were huddled on the floorboard in the backseat crying. I was terrified but could not look away.  My Aunt kept telling my Grandmother â€œthere is no way he can get in this carâ€ and she kept the car still and we watched this motionless creature for about two to three minutes. It was almost completely motionless. It was as if the creature thought we could not see him if he did not move. I donâ€™t know how it stood so still. The hair on my neck is standing on end as I type this. It scared me terribly. He kept staring at us with his eyes stretched very wide. Iâ€™ll never forget that â€œlookâ€ he gave us. Finally  my Aunt decided to flash the lights on and off real quick. The instant she did this  the creature jumped towards the woods and was gone. He was about 10 yards from the woods but made it there in less than a second. I canâ€™t believe how fast this huge creature could move. This event traumatized me. I have never been able to go in the woods alone or enjoy camping since this event. I tried to deer hunt but could not enjoy it and quit â€“ I canâ€™t sit alone in a tree-stand without thinking of this creature and becoming tense. I canâ€™t imagine coming upon this thing alone in the wilderness. I know these creatures exist. There is no doubt in my mind. I saw one up close and personal.

I was going back to Birmingham  on interstate 59 exit 166 as I was going down the ramp to get on the interstate this is what I saw I cought something out of the corner of my eye and thought is was an owl but then I releaized that there was no branch there and when this thing looked at me I remember seeing to huge eyes  and it looked like it had it  s arm leaning on a tree it was about 6 to 8 feet high and a dark color sort of a grey black blended in with the trees.  I just cought it for a few seconds.. I  m just not sure  I just know it was not an owl.. ,Exit 166 or 266 just above Birmingham  Al. ,Blount,4,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1009,yes
65,I was driving a VW bus so I had a good view of my surroundings. As I rounded the first corner of the exit I noticed what I thought was a big white dog  like an Afghan running on all fours toward the road  up an embankment. We both reached the same point at the same time and I thought I would hit the dog. It seemed it didn  t notice my car until it reached the side of the road when it was only feet away from the car. I don  t remember slowing much but I wasn  t going very fast to start with as the curve was pretty tight. As the creature reached the road and I saw it  it stood up on it  s back legs. It was covered with long white hair maybe 8 inches long  it wasn  t thick but more stringy and dirty looking and it had a round head  not a dog.  I passed the creature and didn  t catch it in my mirrors as it was dark. It scared me.I didn  t get much detail of it  s face but I did notice a fairly large mouth or lips which were prominent. The head was not huge and the body was pretty slender  it was probably as tall as the VW when it stood up  over 6 feet. ,I believe it is exit 287 off I-65. I think at that time there was only an exit at that location in one direction. I saw the creature on a curve near the interstate. ,Blount,4,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1009,yes
66,I was riding my 4 wheeler about 11 am when I came over a hill by my house on some gas lines. I saw a harry creature standing about 7 1/2 to 8 ft tall staring back at me. It scared me so I reved up the motor and turned the atv around looking back at the creature as I topped the hill I came to a stop. As I watched the animal it seemed to be very calm as it turned and steped off into the woods as if wasn  t a bit courious of me being there. That was the first encounter I had with this creature. One of the other encounters I had was this year.  Me and a friend from my church went to my land and found ourselves being chased off the back porch of my house  by a very large animal about 1 30 in the morning.  I  m sure it was the same animal I  d seen years before. I have had two more run ins with this creature no doubt the animal is in this area. ,Private Property ,Chilton,2,Alabama ,AL,Spring ,1021,yes
67,I was bow hunting near my grandfather  s house. Early that afternoon around maybe 1 30 I slipped back into a remote section of woods about 1/4 of a mile from the road where I had hung my stand a few days before. After I got there  I didn  t see anything other than a couple of squirrels and an opossum. Right as it was starting to get dark I heard something coming through the woods and I thought it was a deer. Once it got to the small clearing that I was in  I saw that is was a bigfoot. It looked like it might have been about 7 foot but it could have been more or less. I think that it was a female because it wasn  t extremely broad or blocky looking and it also had visible breasts. It had reddish brown hair. After it passed through the clearing I climbed down from the tree and got out of there as quickly as I could. ,About 15 miles south of Clanton ,Chilton,2,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1021,yes
68,I saw bigfoot twice in Chance  Alabama and my mom seen him also. He  s been living down here far over thirty years. I  m forty seven years old and I remember riding my bicycle through there and hearing all the noise in the woods. I thought it was a big deer going through the woods until I got older. Now I know what it was if you want to see him let me know he  s been there from 1980  s when I was hearing him and I saw him in 1992 and 2002. One of our cousins said he thinks it was attracted to one of his horses in 2010. I know he  s still there. ,Hwy 31 from Atmore to 84 west then right on county road 01 about 5 miles to the bridge ,Clarke,7,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1025,yes
69,Me and my best friend were riding down a dirt road right past the oil well rd. we seen a roughly 7   tall big  something  in the road just as our headlights hit it it threw something down and jumped into the woods. we stopped to examine what it was and found it to be a half eaten rabbit. the rabbit was like you had sheared it off with a knife. i saw no foot prints  but i did notice a strange musky odor in the air. ,the location is between the oil well road and the country store ,Clarke,7,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1025,yes

71,Me and my wife and two girls were going to see my parents who live in Cleburne county AL and my daughter who had not long gotten her drivers license was driving and I was up front in the passenger seat and my wife and other daughter was in the back. We had just gotten of the interstate and had turned down the long back road that takes us to my parents . And as we came over a hill and something huge and black darted across the road on two feet and into the woods about 50 yards ahead . My daughter said what was that I was like I have no idea   it was massive and very wide across the shoulders and itâ€™s head seemed to just sit on top of its huge shoulders  like this thing was taller and wider than anything Iâ€™ve ever seen and moved with unreal speed . My daughter didnâ€™t really get a good of look at it she just seen something big zip across the road   but I seen it long enough to see it was standing up on two feet and really big and I guess what stands out to me the most is just how wide itâ€™s upper body was  big enough to know that no other animal could even come close especially around here  and itâ€™s height Iâ€™m just guessing but it seemed easily 8 feet  . I still canâ€™t believe that something like this actually exist I mean how can something that big not be seen more  you hear the stories but to see something like this that you canâ€™t explain  and you know most people will not believe you but I guess now Iâ€™m a believer ,You get of at the first AL exit after you go across the GA -AL line on I-20 at where the fireworks stores are take a left back across the interstate and take the first rd to your right that is the road where the sighting took place.

72,My husband and I heard strange sounds for 2 nights in February 2023 and laughed about how they sounded like the Bigfoot sounds on television shows. The 3rd night at dusk we were on our carport looking into the woods that border our property in Heflin (Cleburne County) Alabama. We saw what looked like Bigfoot peeking around a tree at us. We watched it for approximately 5 minutes as it appeared to look at us from the left then the right [of the tree trunk]. I dismissed it as being a distortion with the trees and wind. I turned to go into the house and looked back and distinctly saw what could only be Bigfoot running away. I yelled for my husband and he also saw it running away. It had our hearts beating wildly and the hair standing up on our arms. There was no mistaking what we saw! ,At the bottom of the woods next to the small cow pasture near our house.

73,well me and my cousin were deep in the woods deer hunting close to our little camp site when we heard some very loud popping sounds maybe 35 yards away  we froze  tried to figure out the sound but couldnt. We started walking it was getting late almost dark we started to smell something. It smelled awful deader than dead my cousin hears something walking heavy  we turn around look down the logging road and see this thing step out of the treeline  it was a good 40 to 45 yards away it had dark brown hair  walked on two legs was very big 9 to 10 feet tall and it just stood there. Out of being so scared we couldnt move either  I couldn  t of shot it if I wanted to but we stared at each other for about 3 or 4 mins and when it took a step into the woods we ran. 1st time ever saw anything like that. I told some people but they laughed and asked me how much I had been drinking but I dont drink so I saw the sight and decided to get this off my chest. I  ve been holding for years and I havn  t been deer hunting that far in the woods since. ,off hwy 72 you will see baker lane  go down baker lane you  ll see emmette holland road  go down that road it  ll open up into fields and woods and you are there ,Colbert,2,Alabama ,AL,Winter ,1033,yes
74,This is a secondhand report posted by the BFRO investigators involved.  Witness information withheld. The following is the witnessâ€™ account as related to Investigator Tim Cullen  At approximately 1 30 a.m. on a night in February 2000  the witness and a friend were planning to visit a girl who lived close to the sighting location. They were riding together on a motorcycle and knew they would not be able to ride up to the girlâ€™s house without alerting her mother to their presence. They decided to hide the bike on the side of a dirt road and walk to the house from there. Very shortly thereafter  they began to hear what the witness described as very heavy walking/stomping noises. The witness described these sounds as similar to  1. an extremely large person walking or  2. like a horse galloping only on two legs  coming from a swampy area which was northeast of their location. They squatted in the bushes and listened for a couple of minutes  at which time they determined the noise was getting closer to them and increasing in pace. At this time they decided to make a break for the motorcycle and vacate the area. The friend of the witness was in the lead and caused a branch to swing back hitting the witness in the head  knocking him down and â€œdamn near knocking him out.â€ He got back up and began running after his friend all the while hearing the sounds of stomping and the crashing of underbrush getting closer to them. When he reached the spot where the motorcycle had been stashed  his friend was already pushing it out towards the road. He commented that at this time he could also hear heavy breathing which seemed to coincide with each footfall. Once they had the bike on the road  they both jumped on and his friend managed to kick start it and take off. The witness stated that he looked back just in time to see a very large creature leap from the edge of the woods out into the road. (I later measured this distance and it was a 12â€™ to 15â€™ jump  more or less.) He said it hit the road on all fours and then stood fully erect. He did comment that when the creature landed on the road  it let out an audible grunt he could hear even above the noise of the motorcycle. He said the moon was full or near full  and it was already in the western sky causing the creature to â€œstand in its own shadow.â€ Since the creature was silhouetted  he was unable to make out any detail such as facial features. However  he was emphatic that what he saw was not a bear as heâ€™s seen bears before and they are much #8220;narrowerâ€ than what he saw (He emphasized this by hunching his arms forward and dropping his shoulders to indicate how a bear would stand and then standing fully erect with his arms out from his sides in the stance that he said he observed the creature to be in.). He said this creature was very wide and had â€œfluffyâ€ hair which covered it entirely. He was unable to see any fingers on the hands although he did state that from what he could tell the hands appeared to be clenched and that the arms were longer than a humanâ€™s. He also said that from what he could see the creature appeared to be a dark brown or black color. When asked about the height of the animal  he said it was at least six to seven feet tall. After thinking for a moment he stated that his father is 6â€™ 4â€ and that this thing was bigger than his dad  making it closer to seven feet in height. ----------------------------- What follows is a slightly less detailed report by Investigator Vince Lauria who videotaped the interview at the sighting location  The sighting took place in February of the year 2000 to the best recollection of the witness  a boy  15 years old at the time.  The moon was full or nearly so.  He and a friend had just parked a very loud dirt bike at the edge of the woods along the dirt road near a swamp at about 2 a.m.  They planned to walk up on a nearby mobile home to visit a girlfriend.   Their  caper  was interrupted when they heard heavy footsteps running through the woods toward them  breaking limbs  etc.  The main witness was slapped in the head by a limb that was released as the other boy pushed the bike back off of a sandy drainage ditch (which fork slightly off these roads) and onto the dirt road.  The witness  almost knocked out by the hit to the head  got up  jumped on the back of the bike and they roared off just as something large and black jumped onto the road  landing on all fours  then stood up and faced them.  The moon was lighting the road  and the creature  from the rear.  Hair was described as long and not shaggy  but  fluffy   dark brown or black.  It stood  obviously broad and manlike and BIG  looking at them as they drove off  its arms at its sides and longer than a man  s arms.  Estimated height near 7 feet.  Investigator Cullen  When Vince asked the witness if heâ€™d gone back the next day to see if they could locate any tracks  he told Vince â€œHell no I havenâ€™t gone back!â€ He said it was probably two weeks or better before they even went near that particular spot again. ,Southern Conecuh county.

75,i had already put one report in   but i thought i would put a separte one in for this. here latly at my house both myself and my parents have heard nioses at night and in the day time around our house. once when my mom and dad were at aunt  s house and it was close to dusk i heard what i thought was someone banging on my window. another time i heard what sounded like grunting out side my bedroom window. the other night while my parents and my self were out side we heard a load howl from across the road   we hear what appears to be growling and moaning to but we never see anything. the person who lives across the street says she has never heard it but she is either always gone or either has people over . in fact the other night my parents saw they hear a banging outside the back window. dad said it sounded as though someone wanted very badly to get in. my dog that is in the house never even growled. dad said that it was funny because he said that rocket (my dog) never got out from under the covers   and he heard it because dad said he felt him moving closer to him. one time while i was out feeding my cats at night i heard something running very fast across the road   i never saw anything. there have been serval times that i have heard grunting and rocks hitting the side of the house. my dogs in the back never even bark. i have 2 labs and a mix and he  s huge but he never came out of his house  unless someone was out there with him at night. when me and my friend were outside talking one night we heard what sounded like breaking limbs. what ever was jumping or walking on the limbs was huge and when we walked behind the house to see known of my dogs were out and the noise stopped. then as we started back around the house it started again. but as we turned on his spot light the niose stopped. my mom said that she saw red eye crossing the road the other night but could not see anything. one after noon while my aunt   my mom and myself were walking in her small group of trees on her side of the road right in front of house. i walked on ahead and came to the fence that seperated her line from the other owner . i say what looked like one of the teepee formations   but i did not get a good look becuase it was on the other side of the fence. i am not sure that this was one of the teepee that these creature make   but i wanted to metion it. ,the small commuity isn  t big it  s just one road (dirtroad). our house sits in front of some woods. theres a creek close to our house that runs all the way around and crosses the road. there is also a bridge   and many mini springs. ,Covington,2,Alabama ,AL,Spring ,1039,no

77,It was April of 2011. My son  daughter-in-law  wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didnâ€™t yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didnâ€™t have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was â€œsomeoneâ€ in  or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling â€œif there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you.â€ My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide  huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point  these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90â€™s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post. Iâ€™m not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person.

78,In July of 1985 on a hot but clear afternoon I was driving home on County Rd. 21 about 1 mile from my home when up ahead I saw these dark figures approach the side of the road.  They were standing there in close proximity to each other and as I neared them  all the while slowing down my speed  I could see three distinct and different sized figures. I  ve lived in the country all my life.  I grew up playing and hiking the whole countryside and I knew the area around my home real well.  I have always loved watching animals in the woods but I did not know what to make of these creatures.  As I neared them  they appeared to be of various heights  about 2 feet or more  3 feet and maybe 5 feet or more and all had brown black thick looking shaggy hair all over.  I could not see any facial features but they  re arms were long for their bodies. They appeared to hesitate as though they couldn  t decide what to do as I approached them in my car.  All of a sudden they ran across the road in front of me and vanished into the thick bushes and trees on the other side of the road. They did not stoop over but ran upright and with swiftness.  I was stunned.  They were no animal I had ever encountered before.  I started to slow down and get out of my car  but all of a sudden it hit me.  I  ve seen something that can  t be explained other than these creatures are not normal creatures.  I was spooked and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.  I quickly gassed the car and sped home and told my encounters with these creatures to my husband and sons.  I will never forget this.  I know what I saw and it will always be with me. ,1 and a half miles West on County RD. 21 ,Dallas,3,Alabama ,AL,Summer ,1047,yes
79,It was a few days after hurricane frederic. I was 11 years old at the time. We lived in a trailer on hurricane rd. and my grand parents owned the hurricane landing & fish camp ( what is now perkins landing ). We were left without power after the hurricane so all our food was on ice. It was about 11 00 pm and my dad asked me to walk to my grandparents store and get some ice  so I grabbed a flashlight and took off walking  it was less than a quarter of a mile from our house to the store and I was very used to walking the route on a daily bases. So I  m walking down the left side of the road and I can here the dogs barking and really cuttin up  they belonged to an older man who lived in a little white house down the road on the right. He kept them in a pin behind his house so when I get in front of the house I shine my light across the street at and around the house  suddenly I see something very large run from behind the house on two legs. I followed it with my light as it ran toward the woods  and then it stopped and turned and looked at me. It  s eyes glowed red in the dark  and all the sudden it runs straight at me  it was so fast  I mean it traveled about 30 or 40 yards in just a flash and then it stopped right at the edge of the road. I was scared frozen  I couldn  t scream or run and we just stood there for what seemed like an eternity but in all actuality was probably just a second or two. Then suddenly it let out a load high pitched growling sound and then I screamed and it turned and ran and I ran all the way home. When I got home I was so upset I could hardly breath or talk  my parents finally calmed me down and I told them what happened but they didn  t believe me. The next day my dad and my uncle went down there to look for tracks but they didn  t find any. My uncle told me I probably saw a bear but even I know a bear can  t run on two legs. The creature I saw was extremely large  I would have to say now that it was at least 7 feet tall very broad shoulders  covered from head to toe in dark brown to black hair  his mouth and large  square teeth kind of stuck out from the rest of the face and the eyes were sunk in. As a veteran I can tell you that I  ve never been so scared in my life. ,traveling south on hwy 138 from bayminette cross over hwy 225 at the cross roads now your on hurricane rd.  stay right at the fork and you will run right into the landing.

80,From the top of this hill the river was almost visible about a mile away through the darkness. We got out of the truck and stood and looked down toward the river. I was raised in the outdoors hunting  fishing  trapping and watching wildlife. I like to imitate owls at night just to hear them respond to me. As my friend and I stood on the side of this hill I began to hoot to see if any owls would respond from the river bottom. Instead of being rewarded with owls responding to my calls I heard a scream or moan about three quarters of a mile away like I had never heard before. I asked my friend what in the hell was that? He replied that it was probably what some of the old farmhands referred to over the years as the hairy man  which some of them had told of seeing from time to time for many years. I hooted once again and the same scream replied only closer this time. We stood there a little longer and could hear something big coming up the hill through the woods very quickly. By the time we got into the truck we were treated to another hair curling scream still in the woods but getting close to the hayfield. We cranked the truck and drove as fast as we could thru the bumpy field. When we arrived at the gate my friend asked me to get out and close the gate so that nobody could trespass onto the property. The gate was a quarter to a half a mile away from where we were run out of the field. As I opened the truck door to get out I was treated to yet another scream from the hay field. The gate did not get closed that night. What this was I do not know. I know that there was no livestock kept in this part of the farm. I do know that if this thing were discovered and somehow befriended that it would be a great asset to the U.S. Olympic team  for neither Jesse Owens or Carl Lewis can run cross country like this thing. This incident happened to me in 1985. ,The events that I can describe took place along the Alabama River in Autauga Co.

81,Sunday morning around 9 am I was driving on the beach express heading north. It was a beautiful morning. Sun shining and clear. There is an area of nothing but trees and brush which goes on for a mile or two. After that the road goes into a  s  turn which is probably a mile or so in length. Coming into the last right hand part of the s turn  I saw what I first thought was a man running from the left to the right across the highway. I thought   what is this guy doing running across the highway out here?  I could see shoulders moving and arms swinging. It was upright and fast  but I couldn  t see any other detail from my distance. It just seemed really dark brown or black. I couldn  t make out shoes or clothing or skin. Whatever it was  it did not slow down once it had made it across the road. It continued at the same speed into the trees. I slowed down almost to a stop where it appeared to enter the trees. I could see into the trees a good distance  but saw nothing. It was gone. ,off of 180 to foley beach express [Investigator (MM) Notes  Location Coordinates  ] ,Baldwin,2,Alabama ,AL,Fall ,1003,yes
82,My daughter and I were traveling to Tok  Alaska  westbound approx. 30-45 minutes from US Customs at Alaskan/Canadian Boarder. We were towing a 27 ft. trailer and listening to music and enjoying the view. An object caught my eye standing in the treeline south of the eastbound lane. I saw something from the waist up reaching to a higher part of a white bark tree. I did a double take and slammed on the brakes and came to a complete stop. Whatever it was had its back to us and still was reaching up with its right arm. The animal was a beautiful blond/auburn coloration and appeared well groomed as I could see the waist and well developed shoulders that blended into the head. I didn  t see a real neck. I made a mental note using the tree as a height measuring device. I reached for the camera and my daughter but when we left our truck the animal was gone. We returned to our truck and continued driving until we pulled into the rest stop mentioned above. I took a tape measure from the tool box and measured a similar looking white bark tree using my mental notes....The animal I saw stood at better than 9 ft with an overhead reach greater than 12 ft. ,We were traveling westbound when the animal was sighted  standing at treeline on slight rise south of eastbound lane of highway.  We continued travel westbound several miles and pulled into a rest stop on the south side of the highway. To fix a better location we were approx. 30-45 minutes west of Alaskan/Canadian Border  westbound and several miles after seeing animal  we stopped at a rest stop on the south side of the highway. Hope this helps. Also  for what it may be worth  several local natives were having lunch there and we shared what we saw with them. I believe one worked for the state road system as he was driving a state vehicle and another mentioned he was a state sponsored hunter for rogue bear. The hunter thought I had seen a grizzly  from the coloration  the height and the lack of a neck (he reasoned that the grizzly  s hump  when viewed from behind could be mistakened for a head). ,Southeast Fairbanks,3,Alaska ,AK,Summer ,2240,yes
83,I was going for a drive. I had 3 kids with me  my daughters and one of their cousins. It was starting to get dark. I decided I wanted to turn around and not go all the way down to the sort yard. So I pulled into a turnaround. I had the car lights on. Just in the bushes on the other side of the road  I noticed some movement. I thought it might have been a deer  so I stopped the car. The first thing I really saw was really bright blue eyes. Then I noticed how far up they were  the thing had to be about 8-9 feet tall. The rest of the thing was real dark  might have been black or dark brown. My daughter saw the feet....they were huge. When I realized it might be a bigfoot  I freaked out and tore out of there. I  ve never been down there after dark again. I rarely go there at all. It didn  t move after the initial movement we saw  it just stood there looking at us. ,Between the sort yard and the garbage dump  on Saltery Road. ,Prince of Wales,3,Alaska ,AK,Spring ,2198,yes
84,I and my cousin were walking down Harris River from the Harris River camp ground. We were walking about 30 to 45 minutes when my cousin thought he saw something standing in front of us about 100 feet or so away. When he asked me if I could see what it was  I told him I couldn  t see because I didn  t have any contacts on or glasses. So he told me it was just a stump so I was like ok.. Then we went over to where we thought the thing was and in the sand about an inch deep there was a footprint like a man  s. In shoe size it looked like it might have been like a size 13 or 15  There were 3 foot prints and about a minute later we ran for about ten minutes and we started walking and then we got to the road  about a mile away from the picnic area  where we were having a Mother  s Day picnic  We started to race each other to the picnic area where our family members were. Then we told them about it and we just kept it to ourselves for some odd reason. ,From Klawock drive southeast on the Klawock -Hollis Road to the Harris River campground  approximately 4 miles west of Hollis. ,Prince of Wales,3,Alaska ,AK,Spring ,2198,yes
85,This incident happened last night just after 11pm. My daughter was home alone. She lives with a relative  who was out of town. She called me at 11 22 pm; she was terrified. She said she could hear something walking back and forth by her bedroom window. She also said she looked out the window when she first heard it  and saw  something  big and black  really big. She described the  thing  to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window. When I went down to look behind the house this morning  I stood by the window. I am 5  4  and my eyes just reach the bottom of the window  so I figure this  thing  must have been 7-8 feet tall. We live in a small village of less than 500 population.  There are a lot of bushes and trees in between the houses. Their house is close to the beach  and there is forest surrounding the town. Now  I  ve never known my daughter to afraid of anything  but last night when I went to pick her up  she was shaking like a leaf  she was hysterical  it took me almost an hour to calm her down. I questioned her about what happened. She called me about 5 minutes after she first saw it.  She was too scared to move. When I got down there  I would not look behind the house  but she was hiding in my relative  s closet. She said it was walking back and forth right behind the house. She described the footsteps as a sound that someone very large walking on two feet  kind of like a  stomping . My daughter is very down-to-earth  not one prone to dramatics. When I first went down there  I didn  t really know what was going on  just that my daughter was scared spitless  but I would not look behind the house. When I went up to the house  my hair felt like it was standing on end  and I had goosebumps really bad. I was scared and didnt know why. ,At the edge of town. ,Prince of Wales,3,Alaska ,AK,Winter ,2198,yes
86,Around 6 45pm on April 23rd  2008  as my son and I were coming into the US from Canada.  We were traveling west about 14 miles on the US side of the US Canada border on the Alcan highway.   My son was driving.  If you  ve ever driven that road  then you know how the pavement has huge dips in it  I suspect from the freezing and thawing of the foundation of soil under the pavement.  Anyway  my son was watching directly in front of the car to make sure we took the smoothest path around some upcoming heaves in the pavement.  I was watching further down the highway as I had done our entire trip from Lethbridge  AB.  My hope was to catch a glimpse of a bear  moose or some awesome wildlife or some kind.   Anyway  we were on a slight decent down a hill  making a slight left corner and about to start up the other side when I saw what I thought was a human crossing the road  may 3-tenths of a mile ahead of us and up then slight incline.  He was a tall  odd looking fellow and I joked to myself when I first saw him..   Well  there is sasquatch up the road   fully expecting to see that a person had crossed from a house or something on the left-hand side of the road over to another house or something on the right hand side.  When we got to the point where the structures should have been  there was nothing..  I mean nothing.  And no sign of any human  animal or anything else on the right hand side of the road in the woods.  This thing was walking upright like a man  long arms and what looked like a long neck from the side.  It had a fairly long gape in his walk..arms swinging with each stride.  It was all one color...I described it to my wife as the color of a Carhartt rust/brown full cover-alls.  I called her first thing when we got cell coverage in Tok.  She got on the web and saw where this was not the first time a sighting happened in this very same area.  I was so glad that someone else had seen it!  I hate to say it  but he looked similar to the representations on TV and pictures!  By the way  I have always thought this whole thing was a bunch of nonsense.  If nothing else  someone was wearing a suit to make them look like the sasquatch character. ,I believe it was about 15 miles from the US Customs office. ,Southeast Fairbanks,3,Alaska ,AK,Spring ,2240,yes
87,This is an excerpt from a short story I wrote about this hunting trip for mostly my family.  I am 64 years old and have 40+ years in law enforcement  currently serving as chief of police. With hunting season not to open until the day after next  we were in no hurry and enjoyed the evening with a touch of good single malt Irish talking about our past hunts and the one we were about to have.  Loyd and Davis would not arrive until the first day of the hunt  presumably because Dave had become domesticate sometime after the previous yearâ€™s hunt and had to attend a retirement party before being allowed to leave Valdez for camp. With the evening expended and the toll the day had taken on us we were in our sleeping bags and doubtlessly turning logs into sawdust by 2300 hours.  The stove was stoked with fresh firewood and all was good.  About 0215 I awoke feeling way too warm  unzipped my bag  slinging the top off  when I heard a resounding crack of wood striking wood  similar to a Louisville Slugger solidly striking a large  sound Birch tree very close to the cabin.  There being no one within many miles of us  my attention was immediately focused on the sound.  A few seconds later  the sound was repeated  which was to be the pattern for several minutes while I attempted to evaluate it to determine its source.  I finally decided to wake Bill saying in just above a whisper  â€œhey Billâ€.  He stirred responding with something that sounded like â€œwhatâ€ and did not move again for twenty minutes; when he woke up and asked what was going on.  In the mean time the commotion stopped when I initially attempted to awaken Bill up and I was sitting on the bunk with my .450 in hand waiting for whatever eventuality might arise.  Nearing 0300 hours I finally returned to a sound slumber awaking well into the following morning. With a spot of coffee in our gullets and having explained to Bill the events of the previous night we explored the area of the old village  inclusive of the nearby grave yard  in an effort to find an explanation.  We found numerous paths traversing the grassy area around the cabins with a multitude of bedding sites.  Never did we find anything that would provide us with an answer to the question of the source of sounds.  Explaining this to another friend after our return  with the experience of spending many years living in numerous villages  he asked me if there was a native graveyard nearby.  It is less than 50 yards from the cabin.  Nevertheless  I named the source â€œSassyâ€. ,This is near Ketchumstock Mountain  about a 30 mile jaunt by ATV  s to the west of the Taylor Highway south of Chicken Alaska. ,Southeast Fairbanks,3,Alaska ,AK,Fall ,2240,no
88,This past spring at approximately mile 106 Richardson Hwy  traveling to Princess Hotel for breakfast on a Sunday morning  about 1/4 before the right turn to Princess Hotel a very Large 2 legged CRITTER ran across the road in front of me and my wife. In 3 steps on a dead run was into the ditch and into the timber. Wish the snow would have been on the ground  but ditches weren  t mowed yet.  No visible tracks just brush pushed down. Never seen anything afterwards till late summer in August  watching TV late evening I started hearing noises and thought my surround sound was on  muted the tv  randomly heard it  sounds like a wood knock  and frequently I went outside and it was coming from behind the house. I live at mile 109 Richardson  and no neighbors in that direction for quite aways.  It kinda freaked me after. I knew what it was but after that I haven  t heard anything since.  I always carry a sidearm when cutting firewood or just out riding. I truly believe we have a Bigfoot in our area ,[Investigator (MM) notes  Richardson Highway north of Copper Center.

89,My hiking partner and I arrived late to the Kennikot area. We were trying to make it to the camp sites near the glachier but it started getting too dark even for us . So we decided to camp at the first available site . We found a small spot right off the trail so we made camp and hung our supplies in a tree down the trail   started a fire and were just finishing a small meal when I walked to the trail to smoke. I was standing on the trail a few minutes when I noticed what I thought was a man on a bike coming down the trail. I let my partner know  but when I looked back it was still in the same spot. I started looking more closely to see a face or the bike or something. It was then I realized it wasn  t a person. It was a large dark form legs spread apart  this is what led me to think it was a person on a bike. The arms were curled at it  s side like someone with hands on handle bars. Too big for a bear and the legs were too far apart. I called my partner but when turned back to look at it again it moved very quickly into the woods on two legs. The next day we looked but found no evidence of anything on the trail. I  ve told this story to a few people but they all think I  m crazy. I hope that this helps. I know what I saw  I guess I  m just hopeing somebody belives me.... ,On the main trail toward the glacier  before the stream about 1 mile past the Kennikot settlement at the abandon dynamite shaft. ,Cordova-McCarthy,1,Alaska ,AK,Summer ,2261,yes
90,To whom it may concern  I am a commercial fisherman in Alaska and have been doing so since 1970. I am an avid outdoorsman  hunter and someone who just loves to get out there. Every year after fishing  I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska  s interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip  we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks. One of which  was so big  it put chills up my spin and gave me and my companions a very uneasy sense of insecurity. What set this track apart from the others was it  s enormous size and human shape. In one of the pictures that I took of this track  I placed my foot next to it on the ground  keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot. Whatever made this track was so heavy  heavier than the biggest bear  that it pushed the gravel so far into the earth that it made us truly speculate what we were looking at. Other pictures that we took of bear tracks were nowhere close to the indentation that this track had left. One of the most intriguing things about this track was there were no visible claw marks as with all the other bear tacks. Both of us felt extremely uneasy of our surroundings and had the feeling that we were being watched. For the rest of the day we didn  t have much to talk about  and that night felt uncomfortable at camp. We never heard or smelt anything out of the ordinary. To this day I  m not too sure what we saw and I  m not making any claims other than the words I have put fourth. I would like to include the photos I spoke of  as maybe you or someone on your staff might help me shed some light on this situation. I want nothing but to put my mind at ease. Wether this is a bear track from an extrememly enormous bear or...? Please help if you have any input. ,Approximately 95 miles east of Egegik  Alaska.

91,Me and a couple of friends had been bored  when I decided we should take a walk through the woods behind my house. I didn  t think much of it  as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us  and we set out at about 11 o  clock at night. It was rather dark  but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold  as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers  runners  cross country skiiers  and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot  and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in  one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back  we heard wild dogs barking wildly  and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint  whereafter we walked. When we walked  we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized  some thing had been following us  as well as testing us  or even harassing us. It was much earlier  I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren  who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping  but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping  when he told me it wasn  t  and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped  and shone a flashlight around  hearing noises such as steps  and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously  I wasn  t. He decided to walk behind with me  when something threw snowballs  and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke  and we picked up a light jog  for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods  we had again heard dogs  and maybe 20 ft away  the branches breaking  and again  something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left  it was about 3-3 30 in the morning. I did not go directly to my house because I didn  t know if it was still following us. I know this was not a prank because the snow is more then 5 ft deep in the woods  and someone would have a extremely hard time to play a prank like that. ,Few houses on the way  a power relay station.

92,I and two of my friends were bored one night so we decided to do a little snowmachining. Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage  there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house. We took off at probably 11 pm  rode up the road about a quarter mile  and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow  with no tracks. I was leading the way for about a half hour  then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me. I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot. It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away  jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness. I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said  We need to get out of here    and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house  they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn  t anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn  t like talking about it. ,Up near powerline clearings east of Potter Marsh in Anchorage. ,Anchorage,2,Alaska ,AK,Winter ,2020,yes
93,My hunting buddy and I were sitting on a ridge watching for Caribou. About 1000 yards away a large clearing was in view. While we were glassing the clearing for caribou to come out of the brush we watched a large grey animal walking on hind legs walk between two large spruce trees on opposite sides of the clearing. We are both long time Alaskans  avid hunters and have logged many  many hunts in North America. I have hunted all of North America  s Deer  elk  Black and Grizzly Bear. I have never seen an animal like what we saw that day. we watched it for over a half  hour move from one tree accross the clearing to the other tree. eventually  caribou moved into the area and we lost sight of the animal when it moved off into heavy brush. We had never heard of a Bigfoot in AK. But we did tell the Bush pilot that picked us up from our hunt that we had seen something strange. He told us we had probably seen the  Hairy Man  A well known animal of the Iliamna region by the native people. ,45 miles by air west of Lake Iliamna  Alaska in the Mulchatna River Drainage ,Bethel,1,Alaska ,AK,Fall ,2050,yes
94,I was part of a group of about a dozen Army personnel training in the area. It was summer on a warm clear day. We were above treeline and had been camped there for several days. I was looking across the nearest valley when I spotted movement. It was on the base of a steep mountainside in bare  rocky terrain  with snowfields descending down the small gullies on the hillside. It was moving up the valley about a half mile away. When it crossed the snow  you could plainly see that it was not a bear. It walked upright with long strides and arms swinging and moved fast across the white snow. It was dark in color like a bear. I have seen bears many times since in the same type of terrain and they do not move like this did. It was too big and fast to be a human. Bears can and do walk upright  usually for short instances when they need to see or smell something and need the height. They don  t travel in this manner and not in difficult terrain. I pointed it out to the other guys and we watched it until you could no longer see it. When it was out of the snow it was hard to see against the rocks. We wanted to go look at the tracks but everyone was scared to go down there. We had to sleep there that night and nobody would go outside after dark. The next day we got out and never went back. Twenty years later  I still would not go up there even with a group and with guns. The only thing I have seen that looked like this is the descriptions of bigfoot. ,Black Rapids Glacier  Alaska Richardson Hiway south of Delta Junction ,Fairbanks,4,Alaska ,AK,Summer ,2090,yes
95,This happened in late August of 1997 in a side valley of Goldstream Valley  a relatively populated area just north of Fairbanks.  Although it  s quite close to the Fairbanks area and there are many houses and roads in the main part of Goldstream  the side valleys are still as wild as they were a thousand years ago. I was hunting ruffed grouse in one if these side valleys (I prefer not to say which one).  I was on a south-facing aspen covered hillside  and had hunted all afternoon and evening  intending to spend the night out on the hill and hunt my way back in the morning. As I was making camp  a black bear almost walked right into me.  I heard him coming from a ways off  and scared him away before he got closer.  later on  it will become apparent why I mention this.  So I was sleeping out in the open  no tent  under a spruce tree.  Sometime in the middle of the night  I was awakened by something prowling around my camp  maybe thirty feet or so away from me  walking in a circle.  I mentioned the bear before. . . this was not a bear I heard in the night.  My father is a hunting guide  and I literally grew up hunting bears.  I KNOW what a bear sounds like when it  s walking.  Whatever this thing was  it was walking on two legs  with a bit of a shuffling sound between each step  like it was dragging its feet a bit.  The leaves on the forest floor were dry like potato chips  and it was breaking a lot of branches--I could hear it and follow its movement quite distinctly. I have to say here that I  ve spent a LOT of time in the Alaskan bush  and have never before or since been truly afraid of anything I  ve encountered  but I don  t mind saying that on that particular night I was literally shaking with fear. It circled my camp for what seemed like hours  but it was probably only five minutes or so.  Finally  remembering something I had once read about the Athabascan Indians   beliefs regarding  woodsmen   I started talking to it  albeit in a shaky voice  saying I wanted no trouble that night.  The thing stopped dead in its tracks  then a few moments later  I heard it trotting downhill  away from me.  Talking to such a creature may sound kinda cornball  but all I know is that it worked. I  ve kicked myself for this many times since  but the next morning  I didn  t bother to look for any tracks  hair  etc.  I just packed up and resumed my hunting.  I had no further trouble with the woodsman. As a final couple of notes  I do recall hearing kind of low muttering sound as it was prowling around me.  Also  having since done some reading on Bigfoot sightings  I  ve noticed that a lot of people report the animal having a strong foul odor  to it.  However  I did not smell any particular odor  foul or otherwise. ,I would prefer you don  t include this in my posting  as I still hunt the area regularly... ,Fairbanks,4,Alaska ,AK,Fall ,2090,yes
96,I personally did not see it but a Noncommissioned officer i work with along with his wife  child and hunting buddy were on their way home when according to them a large  hairy about seven foot ape looking thing crossed the road in front of them. From what i could gather none of them are too familiar with bigfoot information. Any way they say it crossed the road which is about thirty-five feet in width in four to five steps it seemed and disappeared into the brush on the other side which leads to a river called the Chena. Both of the guys have been hunting since childhood and are sure they know a bear when they see one. The thing crossed the road on its hind legs and as we all agreed yeah a bear can raise up on its hindlegs and even take a few clumsy steps  but  cross a thirty-five foot road.....naw! They say they even came back later (they were shook) and looked for tracks. He wasn  t too sure but says he found some tracks that didn  t look like any tracks he was! ! familiar with. They were pointed inward as a person who is what i call pigeon-toed. They heard or saw nothing else but were a bit shook and headed home. The entire story seemed incredible to me because the incident took place on a military installation. I really don  t won  t to get the guys involved because they fear ridicule. ,Fort Wainwright ,Fairbanks,4,Alaska ,AK,Spring ,2090,yes
97,It was the month of July  2009 in Fairbanks Alaska.  I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away.  It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area.  Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out.  Most of the area by far is wooded.  It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school.  The school can be seen through the woods.  Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places canâ€™t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet.  But in this area  it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open.  The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on.  It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building.  The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky.  As I was driving  I happened to notice a â€œmanâ€ standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead.  It was more of an unconscious recognition.  Thereâ€™s nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area.  As I got to within about 50 yards  I looked closer.  â€œThatâ€™s no manâ€ I said to myself (I was alone in the car).  Shortly after that  1 or 2 seconds  he bolted into the woods towards the school.  He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked.  I didnâ€™t slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped.  I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so  he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading.  I got a good look at him  but not his face.  I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it.  I was busy noticing other things.  His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body.  It was a reddish rusty color.  I was mildly struck by how red it was  but it definitely had some rustyness to it.  He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs.  He ran with a strange â€œHoppyâ€ kind of run.  It wasnâ€™t a limp.  With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move  but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward.  I watched him until he disappeared into the woods.  There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot.  So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didnâ€™t see him and havenâ€™t seen him since.  A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which Iâ€™m now sorry I didnâ€™t stop to go talk to them about it. The next day as I was driving in to work on the deck  I naturally slowed down in the area I saw him (stopped actually) and was surveying the area when a couple walking their dogs were approaching.  I flagged them down and told the story of what happened the evening before and they told me that about a week before they were with their dogs and were on the way other side of the school property by the soccer field and 3 kids came running over to them saying â€œDid you see the sasquatch  did you see the sasquatch.â€  They also said that what appeared to be a Dad was with them who didnâ€™t seem to excited about it. My conclusion to whether it was real or not is summed up by saying.  â€œIt was either real or there was a man in a VERY  VERY convincing costume.â€ I reported it to the fish and game office in Fairbanks a couple days later.  The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper-.  I even had to ask him to take my phone number just in case. ,The intersection of Auburn and Farmers Loop is about 1 to 1 1/2 miles of the University of Fairbanks campus.

98,My name is Kevin and I  ve been hunting in Alaska for 8 years now. I  m used to tracking dangerous animals like Bull Moose and Grizzly Bears. One early morning we were observing several Large Moose tracks in the mud. I saw a track that looked like a BIG FOOT track. I looked at my buddy and said  what does that look like to you ? and He said  That  s a Big Foot track ! there it was amongst the moose tracks. It was a good 11 inches long and was made from the right foot. I could see all 5 toes. What struck me most was the size of the big toe! The track appeared to be a couple of days old. I looked around for other tracks  but found none. The thing must of been running. I wanted to go back there and make a plaster cast  but it was raining hard. Two days later I went back there and the track was filled with water and nonrecognizable. ,down palmer fishhook 6 miles  right on sunvalley dr. there  s a swamp just off the road. the sighting was down a trail at the edge of the moose range that borders a swamp. ,Matanuska-Susitna,1,Alaska ,AK,Fall ,2170,yes
99,I was on the Thumb Butte Loop in Prescott next to the city park. While driving I spotted  a reddish- brown ape like creature. I stopped the car immediately and observed the creature. The hair on his arms was longer than the rest. It appeared to have little or no neck. It appeared to be very muscular and covered ground quickly. It was hard to judge the height of the creature because of the distance and shock but I knew it was tall. It walked in the tree line and there was a gap in the tree  s about 75 meters long. I watched this creature walk through the opening. I remember his arms swinging and he only looked forward. I estimated (through military experience) that it was 100 meters from my position. I was sitting in the car with my head turned looking out the back and side window. I estimate that I saw him for at least 10 seconds although it seemed longer. What I remember most is my mind was wrestling with the thought that what I was seeing was not supposed to exist yet I was viewing it. It was a most unsettling experience. What I tell you is the truth. I have never told anyone out of fear of ridicule and having my sanity questioned. I hope this information can help your organization. ,Where the park ended and the dirt road began. ,Yavapai,8,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4025,yes
100,First off  I  d like to say that I happened across your website quite by accident -- a link off of msn.com  matter of fact.  I haven  t given this much thought for years. I grew up in Arizona  and was always crawling around the woods  backpacking.  I was a Boy Scout  and we spent a lot of time getting into the back-and-beyond  where the average camper (and most day-hikers) simply didn  t go. One of the big experiences is a 50-Miler Afoot/Afloat trip  where you go 50+ miles both hiking and floating  like a canoe trip with portages.  In Arizona  we didn  t have much canoe water  so we made do. We hiked West Clear Creek Canyon  an extremely remote and tougher  n hell area to get into and out of.  The  trail  was the bottom of the canyon and/or the creek itself.  To continue downstream  we inflated air mattresses and swam  pushing our backpacks on the matresses.  When we reached ground again  we  d deflate and press on. Needless to say  this meant that the area was virtually human-free.  We saw several bears at surprisingly close distance  bears that looked right at us as if to say  what the heck are you?  before scooting away.  The deer also weren  t too skittish  which was cool.  Neither were the skunks  which wasn  t. This hike travels from roughly Payson  near where we started  to Camp Verde  near where we got picked up.  We actually ended up at the end of Bull Pen Road  which used to be a fairly popular day camper location. In any event  suffice to say that the canyon itself didn  t see many visitors.  Now for the time frame.  As best as I can recollect  this would have been in 1977  I would have been 15 at the time.  This has been in the back of my mind for that long -- but to *tell* anybody  you must first join the ranks of the loonie patrol.  That  s how you  ll be viewed  at any rate. All during the hike  we were paying attention to the critters  signs  spoor  tracks  etc.  Several of us were self-described Grizzly Adams  priding ourselves on our ability to identify animals by the evidence of their passing. About halfway through the hike  we came to what I recall was a mini-meadow.  It was a small patch of grass on a fairly stable slab of dirt  anchored upsteam and downstream by large rocks.  I thought at the time that this slab of soil  which was right next to the creek itself  should not have been so well-seeded with grass and low shrubs  but I suspect the rocks offered at least some protection from the annual floods.  At least enough to retain the soil  if not the plants thereon. At the edge of this soil  there was a small strip of mud beach at the water.  About two feet back from the water  and parellel to it  was a large footprint.  And I mean *large*.  And deep. By way of comparison  my foot was used.  I was about the biggest kid there  having a size 15 foot.  Placing my foot next to the print  my boot would be about 70% the size of the footprint.  We had no ruler or tape measure  but I guesstimated it would have been 18 or 20 inches long.  Big dude. I weighed about 220 pounds back then  so I got to be the depth tester  too.  I stepped in the mud  between the print and the water.  Even though where I stepped was wetter than where the print was  I left an impression of perhaps 1/8  deep.  We guesstimated the print itself to be almost 1/2  deep.  As I said  a big dude. There was no drying of the edges of the print  nor had the edges begun to curl down or slide back into the print.  The grass crushed inside the print had begun to bend back up  so we guesstimated that the print was older than 8 hours  but less than 24 hours old. We really wanted to take a cast  but (of course) we had no plaster  and couldn  t think of a suitable substitute.  We didn  t have the time to wait  in any event. Thankfully  the canyon went through a wide spot at that point  and we couldn  t stop to mess with the track.  We had to make so many miles per day  so we had to press on after stalling there for about 30 minutes or so.  We were *very* very vigilant for the duration of that trip  I can assure you.  We had to have walked right past it  either before we saw the track or afterwards.  Creepy  thinking that something that big might be staring at you from the brush or the canyon wall. We heard nothing  and saw no other tracks  no hair  no scat  nothing we could attribute to  the big critter .  We tried  but even our overactive imaginations could not come up with another bit of evidence. ,Apart from the description in the text above  I cannot give precise directions.  I  m not even altogether sure which county we were in at the time  as our hike traversed from Gila to Yavapai. ,Yavapai,8,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4025,no
101,In September of 1998  my son and I were trying to sleep in my camp trailer. We were in the Prescott National Forest  near the Yolo Ranch Headquarters. We were archery deer hunting. We were camped close to another camp with several young men in it. They were drinking and playing music loud enough to keep my son and I awake. It was about 9 00 PM. Both my son and I heard a peircing scream emanating from the woods behind the camp trailer. I asked my son if he heard the scream and he said yes. I asked if he recognized what it may have been and he said no. We have both been in this area many times and have heard about every animal sound that could be made in the area. Elk  Cougar ( Mountain Lion )  Cattle  Fox  Coyote. etc. This was very loud and peircing and wavered slightly. It happened three or four times and we could not identify what it was. Apparently the people in the other camp did not hear it  as they continued with their party and nothing was said by any of them about it. Whatever it was sounded as annoyed with the disturbance as we were. I didn  t think much about it being Bigfoot because I had never heard of any sightings in Arizona before checking you web page. I think I had another encounter with one in Mississippi in about 1973. Should I submit another story? ,From Prescott take Miller Valley Road North about 20 miles to Camp Wood turn off.

102,I was in Page Springs Arizona on Oak Creek in July 2005 with my kids  camping  and my daughter and I saw something. I saw it twice. Also  a friend of mine and myself had some bad feelings in a particular area there. He was camping further down the creek. What I saw was odd. It was grey  4  -5   tall  slender  fast moving  able to hide  and made a screeching noise twice  once when I think it hit something while moving and again  far away when tons of dogs were barking. Could hear stones clicking  walking and breathing nearby after I went into my tent for the night. Our peaceful camping trip turned into us being frightened. ,Lo Lo Mai Springs Campground ,Yavapai,8,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4025,yes
103,i had just finished putting my children and wife to bed and had just stepped out the front door of my house to smoke a cigarette and put the cat out when i heard this very low but loud   whooing   sound coming from the direction of the river bottoms. Hearing the sounds i distinctively remember from the sound recordings and this one was similar to the low  far away moan type sounds on the recording. To even hear the sound in real life made the hair on back of my neck stand up straight.  The sound only continued for about another minute and as soon as it silenced  all the dogs in the neighborhood  even coyotes in the distance  all at once began to bark and howl. I decided to stay inside that night and the next morning went to the tree line on top of the river to see or hear anything else  but nothing more than. ,down from my house down a hill lies trees along side a large river that stretches along the towns. ,Yavapai,8,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4025,no
104,September 24  2008 reporting sound from Prescott  AZ. 09/24/09  11 30 p.m. My wife and I were sitting in our bedroom with the bedroom window open  we were working on papers for our personal budget when we heard a howl that lasted for quite some time  this occurred several times within a 5 minute time frame. The sound was so out of the ordinary that both my wife and I stopped what we were doing and looked out the window and listened to the howl. Both my wife and I have heard many animals from enjoying the outdoors such as elk  coyotes  deer  and bear  but this howl we could not place. When the howls ocurred the dogs in the neighborhood all started barking. The howls seemed to be coming from quite a distance but they were still very noticable. We live in a quiet rural neighborhood where the elevation is approxiametly 6000   with lots of pine  oak  juniper  and lots of  brush. If I were to guess at where the sounds were coming from I would guess from a higher elevation  but not sure. Several days later I had remembered hearing about your web-site and remembered the sound potion of it  so my wife and I listened to the sound tracks and feel that the howls on your web-site and the howls we heard sounded eerily similar. ,driving into Prescott on Hwy 69 go west to montezuma and turn left follow the road and it will turn into White Spar stay on this road until you see a Woody  s gas station  turn right  this road is copper basin follow it up to Sierra Vista. ,Yavapai,8,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4025,no
105,look  i will say first that i really like this campsite and dont want a bunch of random freaks going up there to look for bigfoot or whatever. you guys are professional about this  it seems  so if you want to go there  no worries. but i  d prefer if you didnt give the exact location out. long story short  i was camping up there over this past weekend. heard something really weird on friday night. really creepy too. ive heard all kinds of coyote calls and this was not coyotes  im certain. not a bird either. not an elk  deer  no kind of big cat. couldnt be wolf because there arent any wolves around here. didnt sound like a wolf anyway. i dont dis-believe in bigfoot  not a cynic or anything. so if someone more informed than me listens to these recordings and tells me its a coyote then okay  great. but this was WEIRD. it was NOT a canine type sound. anyway  i was in the tent when i recorded the sounds  so there is static  but you can still hear pretty well. i will upload them to my computer tomorrow and send them to you guys if youre interested. the main reasons im reporting this are that 1. it was really weird  2. i searched prescott bigfoot on the internet and saw the report from the other couple you have on your site. i listened to that ohio howl  it doesnt sound like that. but anyway. im no expert  so if you guys are interested let me know. ps. my writing is kinda all over because im super tired. but the first thing i did when i got home was to start researching this  thats how freaky the sounds were. ,Directions withheld at the request of the witness. ,Yavapai,8,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4025,no
106,My 15 year old son  my friend and I were out frog gigging in a creek off of rd 179 near Sedona and I-17 in Az. This took place on 06-29-2014 at 1240 am. We entered the creek which is knownas beaver creek. We all had our gigs and 100 lumen lights. And were walking up stream after we entered the canyon in which the creek was located. As we entered the canyon I noticed a wrong musky  stinky smell  but I did not say anything because this could have been skunk or javelin which is common in the area. After walking for about 200 yards  my son who was in front stopped and said he heard something walking away from him up the creek. I asked if it was a deer or elk. He told me he could not see because of the under brush  but said it sound like a heavy person. We continued for a few more feet and we all then observed three large rocks thrown from the thick brush above are heads  about 20 yards in front of us over the creek to the opposite side. We all stopped and then heard branches crashing as something crossed the creek in front of us. We looked in all direction with our lights but the brush and trees were too thick to see. I stopped and hit my gig against a tree three times. We then heard branches breaking up stream. We then crossed the creek and stopped. A rock was then thrown toward us and landed in the creek 5 yards in front of us. I advised my son and my friend we need to go  but as we turned to go back out  something very large ran toward us from up the creek bottom in the thick bushes  breaking large branches. We searched with our lites but could not see anything. We then walked out and made it back to the truck. ,Take I-17 south toward Flagstaff. Turn onto exit 179  travel 3 miles to Beaver creek.

107,In mid November of 1975 I was attending the Fenster school in the north part of Tucson  off Sabino Canyon . I would routinely skip a class on occassion or have a class cancelled  so I would hike the surrounding area in the time frame I had. Usually from an hour to two hours. I would look for indian aritfacts and watch the local wildlife  occassionally seeing coyote  mule deer or javelina. I can  t forget  like it was burned in my mind  as I was poking around the old corral that was north of the campus at least a good half mile or more. First thing that bothered me was my hair stood on end  then a pungent smell hit me. then I heard it. I saw through the creasote brush a large grayish/brown hairy creature crouched over a gopher den  digging at it. I was perhaps 50 yards away and stood in total fear and shock what seemed like an eternaty  watching it dig with what looked like its hands  it then started to turn towards me. Thats when I bolted and ran as fast as I could run back to the campus  across open ground (a former polo field crossed by an abandoned airfield for light aircraft). I kept looking over my shoulder as I panic ran to see if I was being persued. I wasn  t. When I got to the office  I immediately reported what I saw to the school secretary  even drew a quick sketch what I saw. She said she  d report it to the authorities. I told a few others what I witnessed...most thought I was nuts  that Bigfoot lives in Canada.  I refused to return to that area for months  not venturing far from campus  and especially with someone along. I would later gain enough courage to go into Sabino canyon  especially with others. saw nor heard nothing.  later in the spring of 76 I was again looking solo for artifacts  east of the campus when I found in a wash large footprint shaped depressions spaced a good 5 feet apart crossing the wash  later walking along. I looked around immediately as fear rapidly creeped again. But heard  smelled nor saw nothing. I took branches and covered up 5 of the tracks and returned to campus. This time I told a teacher of mine  John Yavonovich  what I found. The next day  took him to the site  a good 45 minutes to an hours hike. Showed him the tracks. he too felt something big and upright walked that area. We discussed it with a few others  all felt that  it was a prank clearly . Why would anyone go to the effort to make such tracks so far out and so unlikely to be found? Its been 25 years and I still get goosebumps thinking about it. ,North of the Fenster school  near what was the old corrals  south of Sabino canyon a good mile.

108,Hello my name is XXXXXXXX in the year of 2006 I was employed as a Forest Ranger patrolling the West End of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation I was sitting by the side of the road  right before the start of the airport.  I was waiting for woodcutters to return so I can check their permits.  At this time it was about sundown but it was still light enough to see  I noticed a creature which resembled a man but was covered in black hair  but unlike the BigFoot reports this creature was about average height and I estimated the weight to be about 200 lbs.  I thought I was seeing things  the creature crossed from the northeast and headed west above the cibecue school. It crossed so fast by the time it crossed the road I was stunned and I drove toward the direction the creature crossed hoping to get a better look but it had already crossed into a gully.  I was afraid no one would believe me so I kept it to myself.  I don  t know if what I saw was a juvenile BigFoot but whatever it was it seemed to disappear and the creature didn  t seem to know I was there since it crossed about 100 yards in front of me  I was backed up off the road.  It was scary and I didn  t want to get off my unit and investigate or look for tracks. ,The location is about 1/2 mile northwest of the CBQ school just east of the old airport ,Navajo,6,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4017,yes
109,My youngest daughter was about 8 when it happened  so that must have been around 1972. We had just passed Kingman  Arizona travelling back to Oklahoma. My sister was with me and our children were asleep in the back. We were driving one of those VW  Lovebug  type vans  so when I say that what we saw was taller than our vehicle  I am saying it was taller than that VW van. It was dark  probably around 9 p.m. or later. We were not too far out of Kingman when this creature just suddenly appeared at the side of the rode from the shoulder area. It had its hand stretched out towards us. Maybe it was keeping our lights out of its eyes. It must have been 7 feet tall. It  s eyes seemed aglow and they were manevolent. It moved so fast. We were surprised to see it  and even more surprised that it kept on crossing the road. I hadn  t slowed down and before you could blink an eye it seemed like it was in the middle of the road and I had to swerve to miss it and in swerving  I braked a little. My sister screamed at me   Don  t stop  don  t stop. Just keep going.  It had less hair on it  s face than anywhere else. The hair on its arms was real long and it had hair everywhere else on its body. It seemed big and husky and it seemed like a man and at the same time it didn  t. It seemed wild. It  s hair was the color of like dark blonde. We didn  t look back after we swerved. We were scared and we just got out of there! ,We were not to far out of Kingman and we had passed a filling station not that far back. ,Mohave,2,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4015,yes
110,My best friend and I were big night hiking fanatics  and decided to go to one of our usual hiking locations just outside of the Phoenix area. We picked up two of our friends for company  and away we went. We arrived at our destination somewhere between 9 00PM to 2 00AM. We parked our truck near the main road  but far enough into our recreational area where it could not be seen from the road  so no one would think the truck was abandoned. Close to where we parked and bordering the North side of this riparian area is a CAP canal  and bordering the South 3/4 of a mile is a major road. That night we would be hiking through the Northern half of it  and cover 2 to 3 miles to the East. We all walked down the canal road and left it after a while  to hike through small trails with sections of dense vegetation. On our way back we returned on the canal road  following it back to the truck. As we were walking  my three friends became very boisterous  reminiscing about old times  and even singing songs. The strange thing about this was that I usually take part in this rowdiness. I instead was walking just behind my friends and was not interacting with them at all. As we were about 3/4 of the way back  I heard a tremendous guttural growl coming from our left (south) from across a field of dry grass. This jolted my senses! I could not believe my ears! I immediately stopped in my tracks  and knew the closest thing to this sound would be an African Lion  and yet we were not in the Serengeti. I jerked my head left  and at the same time slowed down the cadence of my steps. What I saw sent shivers up and down my spine! There were trees and heavy foliage at the opposite side of the field. In the middle of this grove stood the tallest and fullest of all the trees. It was this tree that was being violently shaken  all the while hearing this lion type growl. Now my senses were telling me this was something bigger than a bear  but as strong as a Rhino. I completely stopped walking  turned to face the direction of the tree  and reached down my leg to undo the safety catch on my bowie knife sheath. I became fixated on the tree until it stopped shaking. I immediately crouched down on the hard packed dirt road and began surveying the whole area. After what could only be a minute or two  two short dark bi-pedal creatures ran from under the trees low hanging branches towards me. They were 3 Â½ to 4 feet tall  husky build  with long hanging arms  and had a dark furry looking outline. They ran straight toward me crossing the dry grassy field  and crouched down about half way across. They ran extremely fast and seemed to almost float across the grass  with no apparent head bob. Incredibly  there was little or no noise coming from them tromping down on dry grass. Since I regularly tracked rabbit and javelina at night  I was able to see and hear with extraordinary skill. At this point I had tunnel sight and hearing. I blocked out all of my friends noisy antics. I spent thirty seconds to one minute watching the creatures staring back at me. I was getting very paranoid  so slowly I got up and made a number of steps to my right  while keeping my head and eyes pointed toward them. I then felt comfortable enough to turn my whole body toward the direction of my friends and start walking. I had to keep my eyes on the creatures. They stood very still.  So I started jogging away  looking over my shoulder frequently. At this point I noticed how far ahead my friends were  and totally oblivious to what had just happened. When I caught up to them  I stopped them and told them what had happened. They thought I was joking  which I was not. As I was trying to convince them  I kept looking over my shoulder to see if there was any more activity. My friends finally took my pleas to heart seeing I was afraid  and asked what we should do. I told them that we should slowly jog to the truck and leave. We stopped occasionally to look back  but did not see anything. After this night my friends always believed that this was a story cooked up by me to make the hike more interesting. I had stayed away from hiking in this area for a few months  then decided to go back a couple of times  only never to return again. My feelings are the same as they were then  that to go back would certainly put me and anyone else with me at high risk of danger. ,Outside Metro Phoenix area (edited per witness   request) ,Maricopa,6,Arizona ,AZ,Unknown ,4013,yes
111,I was archery deer hunting in September 1993  when I had a visual encounter with this creature.  Around 7 00 a.m.  I was slowly stalking down a hiking trail in a heavily wooded area when I began to feel extremely uneasy and almost unnerved.  I had the intense feeling that I was being watched and/or followed.  There were no other people in the area other than my hunting companions and they were not in this general vicinity.  I kept moving along the trail literally one step at a time  all the while anxiously looking around for the source of my uneasiness.  After about 25 minutes  I was standing on the trail just looking behind me when I saw this creature walking rapidly down the same trail towards me.  I watched it walk closer and closer for about 6 - 8 seconds (it seemed like minutes) then when we were about 70 - 80 yards apart  it turned 90 degrees from the trail and disappeared over a ridge.  I followed it to the top of the ridge to try and get another look at it  but when I heard a sound that can only be described as a cross between a grunt and throat clearing  I decided I had enough and left the area. I returned to the area 6 weeks later to novicely investigate and came across what I can best determine to be a posssible bed.  The following year  while hunting the same area I came across an abandoned shelter that has no human signs as far as being built or utilized. , ,Greenlee,1,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4011,yes
112,Incident occurred on an old ranch approximately 50 years ago--i.e. around 1950--and was related to us by a native of Safford  AZ who said she and other people have heard the story all their lives  but as usual people joke about it--but the rancher who claimed to have had the sighting was very serious about it  and he said it was no joke and he would get angry when people would joke about it. The rancher was riding the range of his ranch on horseback checking on his cattle herd  and he saw a large  dark brown furry  upright creature walking on two legs that  was not a bear . He said he has seen bears his entire life up there on the range and insisted  this was not a bear.  He said that when the creature was aware that the rancher had spotted him/her it turned and ran uphill up a steep tree-lined canyon. ,Southwest foothills of Pinaleno Mts--locally known as Mt Graham--nearest town being Fort Grant Military Prison.

113,This report has incidents going back 70 years or more. It is 100% true and as accurate as possible. In the early years of this century  there was a miner who had a camp located in the Mazatzal wilderness area of central Arizona. (Mazatzal is pronounced  Mada-zell ). This miner had located a rich vein of silver  and hauled out his silver ore to the Globe-Phoenix stage route  once a month. He would barter his silver ore for the supplies and food he needed. On one of these trips out to the stage route  he had his 9 burros trailing behind him  each carrying his ore. In an area near the top of of deep canyon  he came face to face with 2 Bigfoot creatures. They were standing in the middle of the trail  and would not budge. After a minute or 2 of the face-off  the miner walked his burros around the 2 Bigfoot creatures  who were still standing there  refusing to move. On the way back to his camp  the 2 creatures had gone back out into the forest. The miner described the 2 as one adult male  and one adult female. The larger one was about 8 feet tall  and quite heavy.The female had breasts  and was quite a bit shorter and lighter than the male. It should be noted  that this incident happened just after WW I  and the name  Bigfoot  had not been coined. This miner died later while walking out from his camp  and was buried next to the trail. There is a small headstone marking his grave site. The camp was later taken over by another miner in the 1930  s (name witheld). The second miner did not report and unusual incidents. The second miner befriended my dad  and gave the property to my dad  in 1940. My dad made numerous trips into the camp  the first being in the winter of 1940. At this time  I should give you a picture description of the mine camp  we nicknamed   Glengowan . It consisted of 2 log cabins  built on the southwest corner of a 3 acre clearing  at the bottom of a deep canyon  that runs east and west  and is several miles miles long. There were 2 other buildings at this site. One a blacksmith shop and the other a storage shed. These 2 buildings deteriorated from age  and their remains are still there. The 2 log cabins were small  and were located just 3 or 4 feet apart. The smaller one was where the first miner lived  and was  chinked . (That means it was filled in between the logs in the walls  making it warm during cold weather.) Back to the story. The first night my dad and his friend were there  they decided to sleep in the warmer  small cabin  as it was warmer  and had a fireplace for warmth. His friend placed his iron cot butted up against the door  which was made of heavy wood  and had leather hinges. That night something pushed the heavy door wide open  causing the 2 men to be dumped out of their beds  onto the dirt floor. They heard nothing  and saw nothing  and smelled nothing. After finding a flashlight and a carbide lantern  they saw that whatever it wwas  and caused the legs of the 2 beds to dig a long deep groove into the dirt floor. The outside ground was frozen  and no tracks were found. Then in about 1943  by dad took a bunch kids to the cabins for a week long camping trip. The first chore for us kids was to collect some firewood. We went down to the far end of the clearing  and were chopping firewood. At this time we heard an extremely loud screaming  bellowing yell coming from the woods  about 50 feet away. We dropped out rifle  and axe and ran back to the cabins. My dad came back to the location with us  but whatever it was  had gone back into the forest. It should be noted that the yell could easily have been heard for half mile or more. The following morning  myself and my friend  Richard Dumont  went down to the creek to get a pail of water. We both saw clearly 3 sets of small barefooted footprints  walking down stream. They looked like small children had been walking in the creek bottom. However  it was miles from any civilization  and there was a ranch house at the bottom end of the creek. There were no further incidents on that trip. A year or so later some of us teenagers returned to Glengowan with my dad. On the way out  on the trail coming out of the canyon  we heard something running away from us  going straight downhill. We had a Rhodesian Ridgeback dog  named Bunzo  with us. My dad suggested that we turn the dog loose  to see what he would do. The dog ran downhill after whatever it was. We caught up with the dog about 1/4 mile down the hillside. At that place we found where the track crossed over an area with no leaves or pine needles  and the tracks were very clear in the soft dirt. The tracks were 17 1/2 inches long  and had a 6 ft. stride. Yet on another trip  my older brother  and a bunch of his friends who had just gotten out of the service after WW II. They had a big party around a bonfire  and later went to bed. Part of the bunch were in the large cabin  and the others in the nearby smaller cabin. Late that night  something jumped on top the large cabin roof  yelling and screaming  and then jumped over on to the roof of the smaller cabin. The men began shooting their .30-30  s through the roof to see if they could hit whatever it was running around on the roofs. They must have all missed  as there was no blood  found the next morning. A year or so later  I returned to Glengowan with my dad. It was in the summer months. While doing the breakfast dishes  my dad suddenly grabbed his .300 Savage deer rifle  and ran out of the cabin to a nearby rock wall. I did not see the creature. My dad described it as a juvenile  Abominable Snowman.  (Remember  the name Bigfoot still hadn  t been coined). He said it had a  pie face  (flat) it  s eyes were dark brown or black  and were round. It had short dark hair all over it  s face. No further description. This sighting report is as accurate as possible  due to the time since these events happened. , ,Gila,6,Arizona ,AZ,Unknown ,4007,no
114,My wife and I with our three month old baby girl in the back seat were traviling N.E. on Highway 40/Route 66 through the mountains near Flagstaff  AZ.  This was right in the middle of a snowstorm.  I stopped to read the map and reasure our directions.  While looking at the map  I turned the rear view mirror light on to help see the map.  in the mirror I caught sight of a huge manlike figure running up behind the vehicle  I turned to get a better look and my wife turned too.  She screamed (Oh My God)!  It was clear to see a huge hairy (black & brown) furry being. It was very tall  large head and long arms  running on two feet toward our vehicle.

115,My family at the time where very much into the whole camping thing. And to this day I still hunt and fish whenener the opportunity presents itself. We went somewhere in the Aok Creek Canyon  Slide rock area and camped along the river. As usual I took off on my own too fish. I was fishing along the bank. ehind me the forest my heavily treed with dense under brush. I heard footsteps. Not your typical steps  but HEAVY thumping steps. When I turned to look I saw nothing and the thumping seemed to stop. When I decided I to get bak to the more serious business of trout fishing I heard it again. I looked around again and this time when It stopped I heard very heavy deep breathing. I was scared to  and flattened my back against a tree  trying to peer around I searched for the source of the noise  but could not locate it. I waited  I tried to make myself small  I was only 13. I stayed still for 20 minutes  my back pressed flat against the tree trying to look around without moving much. All the while I could hear that thumping walking sound and sometimes breathing. It sounded soooooooo close. Finally it stopped. I regained some courage. Shrugged it off as my very good imagination and started fishing again  but I was still nervous. I felt  watched . Again the thumping and breathing. And this time to my left I saw it. A shadow in the dark woods  but an unmistakable one. I saw a dark brown  black body. Maybe three inch fur. Shaggy looking. Six to seven feet tall. Moving away and at an angle. Approximately 35 to 40 feet away. As soon as I saw him he was gone. The woods where thick. ,We had a lab. He was very dull between the ears. Not afraid of anything and wanted to follow me everywhere. I found him all the way in the back of the tent shivering from freight. He refused to leave the tent on these occasions and fought me to stay inside the tent. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,yes
116,I was hunting deer with a friend in area 6A north on 260 from Camp Verde then left on fs149 left on fs142 right on fs142D where we set up camp in 1989. On the third morning right at dusk we headed out to hunt some deer  I told my friend to hike up this mountain and follow it until he comes down on the other side  and I would hike up mid way and do the same in hope of spooking up some deer. We were to meet on the back side at the bottom the mountain and top side of a wash. After about 10 minutes into the hunt I saw a Fox to my right and ahead of me  he was about 70 yards away and heading in the same direction but in front of me . I kept watching him and ever so often he would stop and turn around the opposite of me and look back. I looked back over my right shoulder and about 120 yards away I saw this figure brownish black in color about 7 to 8 ft tall and very broad walking down in the wash. It was looking at me and continued walking deeper into the wash to where I couldn  t see him any more. I only saw him for about 5 to 8 seconds. I wish until this day that I would have used the scope on my rifle up and got a real close up. I told my friend about this but nobody else until about 15 years later. The creature seemed to not want anything to do with me and I of it. I think that the fox was spooked from the creature and surely not me.  We hunted that same area for a few more days and several years after that and I never saw anything like it since.   , ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4005,yes
117,About 15 years ago my girlfriend at the time and I took a trip from our home in Albuquerque NM to Los Angeles to visit my mother. On our trip home we decided to stop by the Grand Canyon in Arizona because she had never seen it. We got there pretty late in the afternoon and we stayed to view the sunset over the canyon. We departed for Flagstaff soon after it had gotten dark. We headed down a less traveled stretch of road as a short cut. I do admit that I don  t remember the highway number  but I will look it up. The road had next to no traffic on it and my friend and I took advantage of the time to talk. The highway was very curvy and we had just come out of a turn into a fairly long straight away when we noticed something walking down the right side of the road on the shoulder. Note the rest of this took place in amatter of a few short minutes although it seemed like an hour. What we saw was walking upright like a man  but was noticibly larger. As we got closer my girlfriend said  is that a bear?  It was at that moment that it became visible that our companion on the road was covered head to toe in brown to light-brown fur (hair). It was also at that moment that I realized what we were looking at. I had seen enough TV and heard enough hunting stories from my dad. I stopped the car. Our headlights now shown into the area that the bigfoot could see them and it stopped as well. We were about 50 yards apart at this point maybe closer. It then turned to face us. I  ll never forget this moment it is burned into my memory. At first the animal turned it  s head slightly to look back  but it  s head seemed to be attached at the chest so it had to turn completly to face us. We didn  t make a sound. We were in complete shock. Our friend was about seven feet tall and was covered head to toe in hair. The body was somewhat without definition as in I didn  t make out features like hips or gender. The arms seemed to be abnormally long...maybe to just above the knee. The face was mostly hairless and looked...well without something else to compare it to kinda like a charactor from Planet of the Apes. Not exactly  but this creature deffinatly was from the ape family with just a touch of human looks. The eyes seemed to glow a bit green like a cat or dog in the headlights. It stood there for a matter of seconds and I could tell that it was thinking about it  s next move. It ran it  s tongue across the front of it  s upper teeth in pondurance. It took one small step in our direction. My girlfriend went bizerk. She screamed in horror. It stopped it  s forward movement  looked around  and headed into the woods near the road in a couple of strides. We never got another look at it. My girlfriend quickly got it together and wanted out of the area. I agreed. We took of and i made a wide turn around the area that the Bigfoot had once stood. I never got the feeling that it ment us any harm  but was very curious about what we were. You couldn  t convince my girlfriend of that though. The event shocked here for life and she refused to ever talk about it again. To this day I  m sure she has blocked it out. I on the other hand will never forget it. It did take me years before I could tell my wife about my encounter. I am only posting my story for my own therapy and the hope that it will help someone else who has gone through something like this. ,On a curvy stretch of two lane highway. I think it is Highway 180. Maybe 15 miles from the Grand Canyon. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,yes
118,I  m not sure if this is what you are looking for but it is the only thing that strikes my memory when I think back about things I  ve heard while in the woods. After listening to the sounds you have listed on your site I realized the ones I heard were very similar. I was 15 and my family and I were on a hunting trip in the north Kaibab region of Az. We were there for 4 nights and 5 days. At the end of each day just as the sun was behind the ridge but not quite down we started hearing a high pitched whoop sound. The sound came as a double whoop(whoop whoop). It was a little higher pitched and shorter. It could be heard from the ridge just west of our campsite about a 1/2 mile or so away. The sound continued for about 2-3 hours or until just after dark. It also sounded as if it was moving around on the ridge and maybe even coming closer as it got louder several times. there was about 30-40 seconds in between each set of whoops. On the second night the sounds started again just like clock work from the same area on the ridge but this time they were answered by another on the ridge just to our southeast. the second sound was alot closer and it would return or answer the one from the west about 1-2 seconds after it would sound. this went on the rest of our trip only from dusk to dark each night. On one of the evenings there was a third whoop that answered in from the north but it seemed farther away and only answered every 15-20 minutes. This made me remember how my father had been hunting in this same spot about 4 years prior and told me how his cab over camper was rocked several times in the night. Each of his hunting buddies swears it wasn  t them as they were too drunk to get up and were afraid of what my father slept with for protection. I hope this helps some. ,We Were camped at a location listed on the maps as  Big Saddle . It is about 1/2 mile from the north rim of the Grand Canyon.

119,We were on our way back from Las Vegas NV going around 89A over the mountian road of Jacob Lake and the North rim of the Grand Canyon. My aunt thought it would be fun to play in the snow so we pulled over  we were in a type of gorge where the road cuts threw the mountians as were playing i thought i could hear someone yelling it was loud because i heard this sound over my cousins snow fight. i guess my aunt heard the same thing because she had a weird look on her face and as we were ready to leave the area we all heard the second howl this time it was loud and clear and deep. so we high tail it out of there my aunt did not want to know what made that noise. i compared this howl to the ohio howl on your website they are exaclly the same. i believe the howl i heard was not from the local wildlife. ,montain road wall to wall plenty of tall ever green pine ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4005,no

123,I am actually kind of hesitant to post this report since I couldn  t verify what animal was making the noise we heard.  I didn  t check for footprints or observe any movement on the slope that might have indicated what animal was producing the noise.  We were driving back to Utah from Phoenix after attending the funeral of an old family friend.  The only people in the car were my 10 year old son and I.  My son has a fascination with science and more particularly earth sciences so I decided to show him the volcanic craters around Sunset Crater north of Flagstaff  Arizona and also to see the ancient ruins of Wapatki National Monument which is on the same road that breaks off of highway 89 and then rejoins it several miles north.  We drove past the turnoff for the campground west of Sunset Crater and then stopped on the road that cuts into the northern slope of Sunset Crater right where a ridge of lava juts out of the ground (on the northern side of the road from the slope of the volcano) like a frozen lava fountain.  This lava ridge is the beginning of the Bonito Lava field that extends north-northwest of Sunset Crater.  I parked the Montero against the slope since there wasn  t enough room for a road shoulder and several cars passed during the incident.  My son wanted to climb the lava ridge and I stayed at the base using the camcorder to film him.  While walking to the ridge I kept hearing a very heavy  breathy huffing noise coming from the slope of Sunset Crater slightly southwest of our position and above us on the slope.  It would repeat every five to ten seconds and I caught my son  on video  standing on the top of the lava ridge  looking back at the slope where the noise was originating  pointing at the location and saying  I think I heard something up there  and I responded  I did too  I don  t know what it is  and my son replied  I think we must get out of here  and I responded by kind of nervously chuckling it off and continuing to film.  I was a bit uneasy since it sounded like a very large animal and I was unarmed in defense of my only son. Unfortunately in reviewing the video  I can  t hear the huffing but it sounded like an animal that was passing a large volume of air in an angry huffing (I have had several bear encounters and none of them ever sounded like this) that didn  t want us there but didn  t seem to want to draw too much attention to itself (my speculation) since there were several people in the campsite/turnout around the bend of the road west of our position that probably couldn  t hear this noise.  It sounded quite capable of making much more noise than it was doing.  Walking back to the car I tried to imitate this noise out load without success but the noise from the slope ceased with my attempt.  The pine trees in the area and on the slope obscured my view of the animal though it obviously knew we were there because we made no attempt to mute our voices and my son  s excitement for being there showed in his voice.  The exact location where we parked is 35 deg 21   59  North  111 deg 30   34  West. ,Exact coordinates are 35 deg 21   59  N  111 deg 30   34  W on the loop road that comes off of highway 89 and goes around Sunset Crater and then past Wupatki National Monument going north to reconnect to highway 89. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4005,yes
124,We always try to get as far out as possible and this past weekend we went in a little further then last. It was on Friday the 8th of October when we got to our location we set up camp in less than an hour and we were just enjoying the views looking forward to some relaxation... We got our fire started about 7 00 pm because it was getting really chilly about an hour later we were talking away just shooting the breeze when We heard something from a distance I turned to my boyfriend and I said shh  listen and sure enough clear as day the most sharp clear screams just came over the wilderness as if it was so clear. We counted them and finally they ended at 12 being the last scream count. The final two of the screams sounded most horrible from the other 10 you can immediately hear the difference it was as if in pain a painful scream. That was it for me to scare me half out mf my witts begging my boyfriend to please explain to me what the hell that was as if he could give me an answer  but all he could say is I have no idea. It seemed as if it were a distance away east of us the steep canyons I am sure carry sound further then it really is but I would estimate it at being 1 to 2miles away all I know is it was clear and carried through the woods. what in the wordl would have a pair of lungs like that? If I had to choose animal or human animal would be off and human no way not that scream in the niddle of no where. Now  I know that they  re are plenty of animals in the wild and I know they all have their own distinct sound  but this was unlike any animal I have heard.. we went down the list of known animals that inhabit the Arizona wilderness and as we marked each one off it became more clear to us that was neither animal  bear  mountain lion  elk buggle sheesh even havelina which are only in the more lower elevations and in more desert terrain. nope  there is no way. When we came back from our trip it was all we could talk about there and all the way home. Just to mention I didn  t get much sleep after that      that night we came home and I put in one of my videos on bigfoot just to hear the audio on one of the recordings and we both just looked at echother like wow! too similar to discard the possibility. since then I have heard all I could get my hands on of any audio I could find. Now looking at my maps of the United states and keeping track of sightings from all over it doesn  t seem impossible that they could be here  with New mexico and Texas around the corner why not. Next time I will be taking my tape recorder. I won  t be caught off guard again that is for sure and will pursue leads as they come to prove he can be in any dense wilderness in any state.

125,Directions to Location 3 Miles east of Lake Mary Rd. on R124. Lake Mary Rd runs southeast out of Flagstaff.  This is popular area for camping and hunting. Guess we were about 30 miles from Flagstaff. Nearest Town Mormon Lake Nearest Road FR124 east off of Lake Mary Rd. Narrative Observed   My wife and I were camped along FR 124 Sun. afternoon through Tues. morning. Monday night  Memorial Day PM  at 7 30 I went for a walk heading east on FR 124 to maybe see some elk before dark. I went at least 1/4 mile and heard a coyote sound off. I stopped to listen and a whole chorus of coyotes joined in for about 4 seconds and stopped as quickly as they started. I would guess they were 1/4 to 1/2 mile southeast of me. A second or so after that I heard an  AH OO  just as distant or even further away in the same direction. I thought someone was calling back to the coyotes but what an odd sound for a person to make  then there was another just the same as the first. I turned back to camp and wondered about these two calls as I walked  I didnâ€™t stop to listen again as it was getting dark and I wanted to get back to camp. At 8 15 I was back and I sat outside our trailer to listen again. Just I sat down I heart the  AH OO  again from the same direction  followed by a high pitch  WOW  sound then another and then one more  AH OO . So there were four  AH OO  and two  WOW  sounds all together  that I heard anyway. The  AH OO  was a mid pitch for a male person  The AH was about 1 1/2 seconds with OO short and slightly lower pitch. The WOW was very high pitch and lasted about 3 seconds. Both of these calls just started and ended without fading in or out and without waver. I listen until 9 PM without any more calls then went in to sleep. The calls were not real loud  if I was walking on the gravel road rather than stopped I might have missed them  but they were bit enough to carry over the sound of the breeze in the trees which was coming from the west. I was hesitant to report this since it was just sounds  but   rather odd sounds for a person or any animal I know of. Also I thought the time  date  location  and type of sounds may be worth reporting for past or future incidents. Thank you for the opportunity to record this. ,3 Miles east of Lake Mary Rd. on R124.

128,Myself and four friends we  re sitting around a campfire listening to a very loud car stereo when 2 of the party simultaneously said shhh shhh what the hell is that  and 1 ran to the truck and turned the stereo off. Seconds later we all heard a loud aggressive  violent  bellowing and deep throated sound that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and made others run for their guns and others their trucks. The hardest part of this event is the adjectives needed to descibe the sound we all heard. After listening to the sound recordings on your website  I and the group decided that the 1978 Snohomish County sound clip and the 1973 Puyallup Washington sound clips are close but not exactly what we heard. This sound was fierce  massive and came from a pair of lungs that nothing short of 600 lbs could produce. We all agreed the sound came through the local canyons roughly 1 to 2 hundred yards away. The 2nd vocalization seemed to come from only 50 yards away and the 3rd and 4th came from 100 yards away as if it moved unnaturely fast from 1 position to another. We all listened to known animal sounds from the net and nothing comes close to this. ,North of Knoll lake about 2 miles ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Spring ,4005,no
129,On this particular night I was awakened by a commotion outside my bedroom window.  It sounded like animals fighting.  There are many wild animal species in the forest where I live including racoons  skunks  foxes  and elk  but also domestic animals like dogs and cats.  I assumed the noise was coming from some of these animals.  After I sat up in my bed  the noise stopped.  I lay back down  and after several minutes I heard some very peculiar noises.  First  there was a series of  whoops  that sounded like a cross between a monkey  s whoop and a whistle.  They seemed to be coming from different locations within about a 50 foot radius.  They were neither particularly loud  nor soft.  It sounded to me like 2 or 3 individuals.  Trying to come up with a rational candidate for the type of animal  I imagined it might be some sort of large migratory bird.  This is when I heard the second type of sound  something like a pig grunting but different.  It seemed as if there were articulation in the grunting.  It is difficult to describe  but it made my blood run cold.  The grunting seemed to come from only one animal  and was clearly audible.  This went on for perhaps a minute.  The area was then illuminated by a passing car and all sounds immediatley ceased.  Several minutes later I heard a loud  crack  from a large branch being broken in the woods at the edge of my yard.  I did not get out of bed or attempt to look outside as I was still quite frankly scared from the creepy nature of the grunting.  The next morning I looked around the immediate area of my yard  but found no indication of what may have made the sounds. ,[Editor  s note  Witness requested us not to publish the directions.] ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no
130,ME my husband our two children and dog.  Were camping in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest In Arizona.  Right by Bear Canyon Lake at the end of Forest Road 9018. Saturday Morning I went for a walk with my morning coffee. I crossed a  fence looking for the lake. It was are first time camping at Bear Canyon lake and I knew the lake was close.  100 yards from the fence I saw a large mound of feces that was steaming.  It scared me  I knew what ever made that huge dropping was still very close because of the heat coming off of it.  I ran back to my camp site and thought it must have been a bear. I was thank full that the fence was between what ever it was and me.  Sunday morning about 4 00AM my entire family was awoken by a loud howling  screaming  growl. It yelled several times maybe 10 or 12 It was so scary I lost count I thought it would never end. The howling screams made the coyotes go crazy.  it was so close to are camp sight maybe 150 yards away in a sloping north east area of the forest.  We laid there as quite and still as possible waiting for day light.  Their were two more camping sights not to far from us but by the time we packed up and went to talk to the people at the other sights they had already left.  The only sound I could find on your sight that sounded close to the sound were form California the 1993 Del Norte recording. The sounds we heard  were angry or like it was injured or mad. ,from payson you take Hwy 260 to the rim lakes turn off FR 300 take road to FR 84 then FR 9018 take that road to the end we camped at the clearing maybe 1/8 mile  befor the end of the road on the north side. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no
131,On a cloudy  cool day I went for a hike at Hart Prairie on the San Francisco Peaks outside of Flagstaff  AZ.  It was August  but the monsoon season was in full effect and it was a cool day for Arizona.  I hiked up slope from FR 151 towards the Snowbowl Ski Resort.  The area has springs and so the plant diversity is high and the wildflowers were at their peak.  Being a cloudy  cool day I kept an eye out for wildlife which would normaly bed down at midday in August  though I did not see anything other than various songbirds and raptors. I had been in the area maybe two hours but as I like to wander around slowly (I see more that way) rather than  hike  from point A to point B at a quick pace  I had not covered much ground in that time.  I was at the edge of an aspen grove when I heard a loud howling from up slope and a little to the east of me in the direction of the ski resort.  My first thought was that it was a foreign tourist goofing off. Because Snowbowl has a paved road to it and the views are awesome  tourists from all over the world on their way to the Grand Canyon stop at Snowbowl and many hike around as it is a beautiful and inviting area.  So I thought I was hearing a human.  But I wasn  t so sure after the next howl- I was really puzzled.  The sound seemed somewhat human-like and the volume  though  quite loud  wasn  t too extraordinary- I could possibly howl that loud  though it would be hard to do without real strain and the sounds I heard were almost casual- no hint of any strain.  But it seemed to be an unusually weird sound for a human to make.  Almost as if the human had a deformation of some kind which distorted the sound.  This was why I thought of a  foreign  tourist first  because of the weirdness of the sound. I heard about a half dozen calls and it was clear that whatever was making the sounds was coming in my general direction at a rapid pace.  By this time  I was sure it was not a human but a large animal. I was at the edge of a clearing and I waited at that spot expecting to see whatever was making the calls.  The first howl was maybe 250 meters away and the final one maybe 75-100 meters away.  Then it stopped and I never did see anything.  I did not hear it moving through the woods and did not notice any smells.  It is possible that whatever it was smelled me as the air was gently moving up slope towards the animal.  I think it probable that this was the reason whatever it was stopped moving towards me and vocalizing. I waited a minute or so after the final vocalization and then I went up slope in the general direction I had last heard it but did not see anything or any indication of a human or animal.  My curiosity was at a peak and so I made a real effort to find whatever it was and spent another hour circling the area looking for signs of a large animal passing through. I have listened to the recordings on this site and I did not make a match between the sounds- though there were some similarities between what I heard and the calls from Washington State and the   Ohio Howls  .  What I heard was not nearly as drawn out and evenly toned as the Ohio recording  but was similar.  A deep to mid-range   howl   with a little variation in the tone somewhat similar to the Snohomish recording.  Each call lasted maybe 3-4 seconds and was seperated by various lengths of time from maybe 5 seconds to maybe 15 seconds.  Some of the recordings on this site  if I heard in the field  I might describe as having a   monkey   quality to them- distinctly animal-like.  The Ohio recording does not really have that quality and neither did the sounds that I heard.  At the time I only thought of a human at first and then I was merely puzzled and could not classify what I had heard. I have thought about this incident since it occurred trying to put some explanation to it.  I do not think it was a human for a couple of reasons   The sound  though it had a somewhat human-like quality  was not at all the type of sound a human would (or perhaps  could) make to communicate to another- say two or more people in the woods who are separated and walking along and vocally maintaining contact with one another. The volume of the sound would have required real effort for a human to achieve and I couldn  t imagine a human being able to howl like that and walk around a mountain at that elevation at the same time- and it was traveling fast.  Nor did it have any element of humor about it if it was just some high spirited tourist having fun.  And there was only one caller  not two or more people hootin and hollering to each other.  The call was somewhat somber in tone and there was no hint of excitement or emotion about it.  Also  a human walking through those woods would have made a great deal of noise and I would have heard or seen a human when I went looking after the last vocalization.  I did not see any humans during that day though I went right to the base of the ski resort and could see the parking lot. At the time  the sounds did not spook me and I never got that unexplained adrenaline rush and surge of fear that I have gotten on more than one occasion in the wilderness or ocean.  I am quite familiar with the wildlife in this area and have heard and seen just about everything except a mountain lion. It certainly was not an elk  bobcat  coyote  dog  or cougar.  It might just possibly have been a bear-  I have had several close encounters with bears and have heard their vocalizations.  But bears do not  to my knowledge  vocalize in such a regular  loud way.  Because I heard 6 or 7 howls  I had time to really hear the sound and think about it.  To me it sounded most like an ape  though I only thought of this much later. What I heard was not much of an incident. I puzzled over it for a long time.  I am reporting it here because a sasquatch is the best possible answer that I can come up with  though I did not come to that conclusion until months after the incident.  So I did a web search on bigfoot and found this site and the recordings.  Another puzzling thing though- if it was a sasquatch  that area is quite popular with people and when I go there  I usually do see someone else.  That area could be easily avoided by an animal.  Despite the abundance of wildlife as a potential food source  why would a sasquatch travel through this area at midday in the summer   howling?  The whole incident is weird... ,This happened just below the Arizona Snowbowl in Hart Prairie on the San Francisco Peaks.  I had hiked up slope from FR 151 which is a fairly well maintained and popular forest road.  Hwy 180 goes from Flagstaff to Valle on the way to the Grand Canyon and FR 151 intersects with the hwy about 5 miles past the paved Snowbowl Road. Specifically  I had started hiking right next to the Nature Conservancy  s preserve straight up slope towards the lower end of Snowbowl.  I heard the howls at the edge of an Aspen Grove about .25 mile up slope from FR 151. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no
132,I heard the same sounds described in the Aug 2006 report at Bear Lake.  I was camping at Spillway Campground located in Apache-Sitgreaves.  This is located close to Woods Canyon Lake. Our actual campsite was about 50 yards from the lake itself. I  m familiar with the sounds of the local wildlife  including elk and owl  and I  m fairly certain the sound was not made by these animals. These vocalizations sounded angry as well and lasted for approximately 10 minutes. ,from payson you take Hwy 260 to the rim lakes turn off FR 300 then take FR 105 to Spillway Campground. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4005,no
133,This happened on a camping trip on the weekend of 08/04 and 05/2007. I went with my friend  girlfriend and son to an archery shoot in Clint  s Well Arizona. I live about one hour away. This area is centered from Strawberry Az. and Winslow Arizona. We were camping off of the Lake Mary Road by Clint  s well in the forest area. On the early morning of 08/05/07 at about 3am I was woke in the tent by a loud knocking of wood on a tree west of camp. I lisened for about ten minutes and heard several whoop type sounds(approximately 3). These were consistent with the recordings on the website. I waited for about a half hour and did not here anymore noise and fell asleep. The next day I spoke with my native american friend who was in the tent next to mine during the archery shoot. He asked if I was woke by the noises last night. I advised him what I had heard and he told me he had heard the same noises. When we got back to the remote camp we searched the area of sign  but it had rained that afternoon and we located none. I have lived in Arizona all of my life and I  m 31 years old. I  m a police officer and I go in the woods on most of my days off. I  ve hunted elk  deer  bear  javalina and most all critters in my state. I have never heard the whoop type noises in all of my years in the woods or camping. The noise remined me of a howler monkey from tv. I know there have been alot of sightings on the White Mountian Apache reservation and by Heber Arizona. These areas are not far from our location. ,Five miles north of hwy 87 and 3 miles west of Lake Mary Road. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no
134,My Girl friend  and her little brother and I where out at bear canyon lake camping on the weekend of august 18. It was 4 00 A.M. When I was awakened by loud foot steps. The steps sounded as though they where 20 feet away and leaving the camp sight. I then looked up and noticed that my tent Zipper on the door was more than half way open. I Then Jumped out of the bed with my side arm and a spot light to look around. I did not see any thing or any one. And the foot steps stopped. I turned off my spot light and climbed into the tent and waited to hear the steps or see a flash light for it was too dark for human to see. NOTHING!! I could smell a slight smell of dirty feet and urine at the time. ,Left Road 3 sights to the left 40 yards from the road ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,yes
135,My daughter was visiting from out of state although she grew up here in Flagstaff.  We decided one day to spend time with one of our hobbies which is photographing panoramic landscapes in Northern Arizona.  We spent the morning in Sedona photographing the red rock country but as usual this time of year the monsoon thuderstorms came up around noon and we went back to the house to relax a bit. We did have significant storms in the area that day but late in the afternoon things began to clear up and we decided to head to one of our favorite spots for sunset photography.  This was at the Arizona Snowbowl lower parking lot.  The area from the parking lot to the west starts with a large lush green meadow before falling away into forest  meadows  and rolling hills (cinder cones)that stretch from Hart Prarie some 80 miles to the Grand Canyon.  We set up our cameras anticipating a beautiful sunset and great opportunities to take pictures.  there were a number of people in the parking lot area (10-15). A minute later two hikers started from the parking lot down through the meadow and I remember hoping that they wouldn  t be standing in that meadow when I wanted to take a photo. As they traversed the meadow and passed out of sight we heard a single coyote sound off in their general vicinity. As the sun sank towards the horizon and we were getting ready to start taking pictures the two hikers came back from out of the woods and up through the meadow nearly to the parking lot. At that moment we heard a scream from the forest several hundred yards below us.  There were people in the parking lot and two motorcycles idling right next to us.  The scream was so loud that not only did we hear it well but one guy on a motorcylce looked at his companion (with motorcycles running and helmets on) and said  did you hear that-what the hell was that ?  We know that most people in that parking lot heard this scream. As the sun was now setting in a glorious fashion with thunderstorms around and off into the distance we got busy taking pictures.  As the sun set and twilight began to overtake things most of the parking lot had emptied out except a pickup load of people had just showed up and they were half drunk and wandering around making noise.  It was getting close to dark and once again we heard this scream from the same general area of the forest below us.  The people from the truck said -   what the heck was that - a mountain lion ?  and began to laugh and talk nervously - I just wanted to say to them  please shut up  since if any other noises were made they would have been difficult to hear above their drunken mumbling and laughing. Finally they left - it was now dark  we hung around for a bit but not long and heard nothing more.  This was not a mountain lion scream or anything else we could even begin to identify.  It sounded somewhat like a scream a human could make but the distance it was travelling was significant.  It started kind of low and built up.  To us it sounded like the voices of 15 people all starting at the same split second and roaring the exact same note.  It had a quality that one human could just not make  both by the volume and the effect of sounding like a group but clearly being one single scream or roar. , ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no
136,These events took place over two consecutive weekends.  My husband and I like to escape the summer heat of the valley (Phoenix) as much as possible  and our usual means of escape is up to the Mogollon Rim in Coconino County.  We have been going there for years  and we know most of it like the backs of our hands  including all the sounds and wildlife in the area.  We generally stay away from the populated lake areas and travel further into the deep woods where there are fewer people.  In fact  some weekends we may not see anyone at all  but most of the time maybe at most a couple of other campers riding ATVs or something. Two weekends ago we were at a fairly remote campsite.  We were pretty closed in by the trees. It wasn  t a large open space like many campsites there.  It had been raining on and off most of the day  and we spent the day reading and napping. I was sitting in the front seat of our conversion van reading while hubby was back on the bed napping.  I started hearing what sounded like an animal ripping bark from a tree and moving around in the dense growth.  This went on for about 15 to 20 minutes.  I was so sure there was an elk or other large animal nearby that I sat my book aside  grabbed my camera and waited.  It was absolutely silent (besides a few snores from the back of the van) that I was hoping whatever it was out there would break the clearing and I  d get a great photo.  After about ten minutes of silence and no other movement I went back to my book  figuring whatever it was had smelled us and moved on. Not five minutes after I had put my camera down and resumed reading a branch about 4 feet long and 3 to 4 inches round came shooting out of the trees directly at the van like a javelin.  It hit the side mirror dead on center  pushing it in towards the van. (It is hard to even move this mirror by hand. The force it took to force it in towards the van had to be tremendous).  The force was such that it shattered the side mirror into many pieces.  There  s still a dent on the back metal portion of the mirror from the impact. I had glanced up just a second or two before impact  whether it was from noticing movement in front of me or just glancing up by chance  I don  t know.  I saw the trajectory  and it was NOT a limb FALLING from a tree. It came straight at us  like I said before like a javelin being hurled at us. I jumped over the front seat into the back and [my husband] woke up immediately. He saw what happened while I was babbling away like an idiot.  His first words were   Somebody threw that at us? Who was it?   We listened and watched for a while but didn  t hear anything else.  A while later I did think I heard movement in the forest  but by that time my senses were so alert I wasn  t sure of what I was hearing.  This happened in the mid-afternoon on Saturday  July 12  2008. The incident rattled me and that night I had a restless night sleeping.  We usually sleep in the back of the conversion van with all the slider windows open and other windows popped out but the front two windows rolled up.  I have no idea what time it was  but I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of something sniffing at the small slider window by my feet.  Whatever it was  it was very LARGE.  It was taking deep  deep breaths like it was smelling inside of the van and then -- for lack of a better description -- sort of huffing/grunting out the breath.  Each breath in sounded was deep and long. . .much longer than a human can do it.  The only way I can think of to describe the breath out is like when a horse sometimes exhales and blows its lips together to make that sound.  It wasn  t exactly that  but similar enough to use it as a vague description. I laid there frozen  barely breathing  my heart absolutely pounding out of my chest.  I kept poking at my husband trying to get him to wake up  but he didn  t.  I didn  t want to say anything  I don  t know why  I guess because I didn  t want whatever it was to know I was awake.  It was pitch black but I could sense it was large and aware of what it was doing.  This smelling went on for a few minutes  of course it seemed like forever but was probably less than five.  I was laying on back back and vaguely glanced a moving shape in the driver  s side mirror but that  s it.  Weird thing is  I never heard it move away at all and it seemed like I laid there for a long time after the smelling stopped.  Maybe I  m attributing things to something that I shouldn  t  but I sensed a bit of curiosity in the creature by the way it was smelling at the window.  Although I didn  t feel entirely safe  I didn  t feel extremely threatened either  or not enough to force my husband awake. When we woke up in the morning the first thing we noticed is that the kitchen had been raided ... but very politely  neatly raided.  It wasn  t destroyed at all like it would be if it was a bear or a coyote or an elk or even a bird.  We had a packet of biscuits in aluminum foil that had been what seemed like very carefully opened and all the biscuits removed and missing.  Not a crumb left like it would be if an animal would have gotten into them and eaten them on the spot.  Out of all the stuff on the table  that was all that was taken.  Also something had gotten in the trash and removed only one thing. . .a Jimmy Dean sausage container.  It was laying a few feet away near the edge of the clearing.  Only something with a lot of dexterity could have opened that aluminum foil without ripping or tearing it at all. We talked about this incident all week and went over what it could have possibly been  then decided to go back this weekend.  We discussed the possibility of a  Big Foot   not knowing what in the world else could have done all this  been so precise  so aware.  I  ve lived in Arizona my whole life and never even knew there had been Big Foot sightings here until we linked to your website through Google Earth. To link this all together  we decided to go back this weekend to the same spot.  While we personally had nothing occur at our campsite on this weekend (July 19  2008)  both our husband and I heard sounds in the late afternoon very similar to the recordings on your website. It was Saturday afternoon and some people down the road a ways started shooting.  Target practice  I assume  since it  s not hunting season.  All of a sudden we heard these horrible screams echoing through the woods.  Like I said  they were very similar to the first three recordings on your website  only much angrier.  We heard the sounds approximately three or four times  each incident in conjunction with the shooting.  Each time it started  the howling/screaming/raging sound started.  We have both spent a lot of time outdoors in Arizona and neither of us has ever heard anything like it.  What ever it was  was very  very loud and long. The lung capacity was amazing.  The sounds were spread out over approximately a 30 minute period. ,[Editor  s note  Directions will be kept confidential  the campers plan to return to this location.] ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,yes
137,My brother  Sister  Nephew  my daughter  and I were on our 08 archery hunt in the Kaibab national forest on the North side of the Grand Canyon. We camped down the road from where our family had a prior experience that was reported under incident #13964. On Friday night at about 9 pm my sister and I walked down the road from camp and made several vocalizations including a howl and several whoops to try and ilicit a response. After trying for about 30 minutes without any return calls we walked back to camp. When we arrived my sister took my daughter and nephew and went into the camp trailer to put them to bed. Just as they got into the trailer the excitement began. My brother and I were sitting around the camp fire talking when we heard what sounded like a large branch being broked off of a tree violently with a loud crash or something stepping on a large branch and breaking it. It was so loud that it caught both of our attentions. We acted nonchalant about what occurred and just tried to listen for anything else and talked. For the next 30 minutes or so we listened as the camp was circled by two separate unseen things. They were not being very stealthy and were actually very loud and destructive as far the trees the were hiding in. The one would pace from the north west side of camp to almost passed the north towards east and the other paced back and forth behind the camp trailer that was behind us. Sometimes we would here what sounded like a smaller tree being shaken  or heavy foot steps inside the tall grass. We could tell that there were two of them as some times we could hear both at the same time doing different things. Then the rocks and sticks started being thrown. The first the two of us heard was a stick thrown on top of a tarp being used for shade next to the trailer. then we heard almost a continous volley of small rocks and sticks being thrown at different points around the camp site. The largest rock that was thrown landed on the ground between us and the camp trailer. It was the size of a softball and when it hit the thud sound it made scared us both. Soon after this we both lost our nerve and decided to go into the camp trailer where there was more cover between us and them. When we got into the trailer my sister and nephew were still awake and told us they could hear everything we heard from inside. My sister added though that she could hear what sounded like foot steps behind the trailer the whole time and she said at one point she heard a loud heavy sigh. She also described hearing branches being broken behind the trailer and either rocks or small twigs being thrown at the camp trailer. My nephew verified her account and we all tried to go to sleep. Shortly after turning off the lights we all heard a loud metallic thud. Just outside the door of the camp trailer was a sheet metal box with food in it on a small table. The noise sounded like either something had knocked on the box or threw something hard at it. We all fell asleep quickly except for my brother who could not sleep. He stated for a good time later he continued to hear things being thrown at the camp trailer. He eventually did fall asleep but was awoken some time in the early morning to what he described as a branch object being being drug across the canvas top of the trailer over his head. Whatever it was it passed from one side of the trailer to the other. The next day was uneventful as we did not try to make any calls. My nephew had made himself sick he was so nervous from the night before. We also had rain that night and another hunting group had moved in about a mile down the road. on Sunday night my sister and I again went off down the road to try making calls. This time we went off down the opposite side. We repeated our attempts that we made on Friday and still had no response. We returned to camp and sat around the fire for about 30 minutes without any incident. We then went to bed. During the night as we slept something approached the campt trailer and shook it violently at least 6 times spread out throughout the night. I can say it was not the wind as the trailer did not sway to one side from being blown but it felt like something grabbed the side of the trailer and twisted it from side to side in both directions very violently. All of the three adults felt this go on throughout the night. My brother also described that at about 1200 midnight he heard a low growl that lasted about 10 seconds. He described it as subtle but strong as he could feel the vibrations produced by the sound and he said it felt like it was shaking him slightly. The next morning we left to go home. During the weekend we checked the camp trying to find sign or prints. The ground around the camp was covered with a thick layer of oak leaves and pine needles. The only thing we found were the small 3-4 inch sticks and small rocks that were used to pelt our trailer. ,We were camped east of Crazy Jug Point near Big Saddle. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no
138,On Saturday 09-13-08 around 2am in the morning in the Kaibab which is located in Arizona. My husband Chris and his brother were there to do some Grouse hunting. He stated that he was a sleep when he felt our pop-up camper being pushed and would stop and repeat. He said that he stood up and walked over thinking it was his brother moving alot in his sleep. He woke his brother up to ask him he said No!  My husband goes out side to see what was going on he looked all around the camper and nothing. He said that all of a sudden he heard some thing walking in the woods behind the camper. He shined his flash light and saw nothing. He walks back in the camper when he heard this loud whooping sound it went on for a while. He has heard nothing like it before. He hunts alot I found your web site the same recording of the whooping sound is the same sound that he heard. We are business owners good people we have to see it to beleave it sort of people. For my husband peace of mind he wanted to contact someone  to let them know. I didn  t know if I should contact game & fish.I feel more comfortable contacting you.

139,Was out on one of my snowmobiles after we already got 3 feet of fresh powder on a boat launch road for Willow Springs Lake on the Mogollon rim above Payson  Az where your team is at right now on 3-8-12 in Payson. I was the first tracks in virgin powder. When I got over a mile & a half or so from the highway a hundred yards or so from the lake I observed foot prints crossing the road deep in the forest heading south. Not snow shoes or boots. At the time I was trying to figure out what the hell I was looking at spaced 4 feet apart in 3 feet of fresh powder. The thought did cross my mind of you know what but I never heard of the Mogollon monster in the 6 years I  ve been living and snowmobiling here in the Payson area. I know what I saw and only told a handful of friends and family about it. The forest service closes all the forest road gates on December 15th every year and most all the wild life heads south for lower elevations out of the deep snow. ,Sitgrieves National Forest  30 something miles east of Payson. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4005,no
140,It was 6PM and I was supposed to meet my wife at FR 115 (**** mts away) at ****.  My son and I were just getting ready to leave the campsite.  As soon as I stood up from my chair  I saw what looked like a VERY large man in a ghillie suit walk across the opening in the trees to my left.  I had a clear sight and it was VERY large.  I could see the arms swaying  and my son was able to see the legs separate as it stepped.  It didn  t seem to be in any rush  and seemed to be walking rather casually (kinda slow) but it covered a lot of ground in very few steps.  As I said  I could see both arms swaying  and it was not carrying a rifle or anything else that I could see.  Hunting season had been over for at least a week  and the next one wouldn  t start up for months.  At this time  there was almost nobody out here  and nobody knew where we were.  I had my son stand where it had walked  and the top of his head would have been where it  s shoulders where.  My son is 6 ft tall.  If it had been a man in a ghillie suit  the guy would have been at least 7 1/2 feet tall. , ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,yes
141,Itâ€™s taken me a long time to write this report because shortly after the incident  I managed to convince myself that it couldnâ€™t have been a bigfoot.  A few months later  a friend had a nearly identical incident at the same location which made me reconsider.  As a mechanical engineer  I am trained in the hard sciences and as such  I am a scientist.  I really donâ€™t believe in something unless there is hard evidence or the scientific community is in agreement.  Since the incident and my friendâ€™s incident I have been doing a lot of research and feel that there is substantial evidence that a forest primate exists in North America.  As a scientist  my previous position was that something could exist but there was not enough evidence to prove it.  I do admit that I have always had an interest in the bigfoot phenomenon and knew some things about it like wood knocking  howls  etc.  I also took a natural anthropology class in college.  My teacher was one of the most famous anthropologist of our time and I learned well about all of the primates  the australopithecines   early hominids and of course gigantopithicus. My point is that I am an intelligent person who had an informed skeptical position concerning the bigfoot phenomenon but has come to believe that the forests are inhabited by either an early hominid or a great ape  or something in between.  I am known for my situational memory and feel that my remembrance of the incident has not diminished.  I have told my story many times and every time I get goose bumps.  It was Aug of 2010.  My wife  brother  father-in-law and I were camping on the Mogollon Rim.  We were in my favorite spot in a remote location of the Apache Sitgreaves Forest that I had been frequenting for about two years.  We were not doing any particular activities like shooting or hunting  we were not riding quads or anything.  It was a two night camping weekend for us and for the most part we were just hiking and relaxing and observing elk.  The oddest thing about this weekend was that there was almost nobody in this area of the forest  a lot of people avoid camping during the monsoon although this weekend was basically dry.  The closest campsite was about 2 miles away.  It was occupied by two older couples whom I had spoke to earlier that day of the incident.  The other notable observation was that it was a pitch black  moonless night in which it must have been overcast because I could only see about 3 to 5 feet.  In retrospect  I cannot imagine these two elderly couples creeping 2 miles into my camp  on foot  without lights  just to disturb us in our sleep.  Also  Arizonans are known for their gun toting  it is never wise to approach someoneâ€™s camp unannounced especially in the middle of a pitch black night. I have been an outdoorsman since I can remember and am an accomplished hunter. I am familiar with the Arizona fauna and the sounds they make.  At about 12 AM  I was awoken to the sound of two sticks cracking together near my RV trailer.  The knocking sounded as if somebody had two girthy sticks  maybe about 2 inches in diameter  and they were banging them together at a perfect 2 second interval.  Sometimes the sticks sounded a little different as if a knot had been struck but the timing was never flawed.  Now a lot of people say â€œwell that could be an elkâ€™s antlers or some bird cracking his beakâ€  but I have never heard a known animal make this sound  let alone in perfect repetition for the duration that I heard it.  But that wasnâ€™t the strangest part; the sound was translating through the forest quickly and without making additional sounds.  The sound was emanating from an area on the backside of my trailer and receding away.  It would then come closer and recede again.  This was happening over and over.  I would say that it was probably about 20 to 30 yards at the closest and went out an additional 50 to 70 yards away.  My campsite was near a primitive road and the sound seemed to parallel the road but I canâ€™t be sure. After lying in bed  listening to this for about 2 minutes  I decided that I needed to do something about this thing that was disturbing my camp.  Familiar with the observance that bigfoots knocked wood  a bigfoot did come to mind instantly  but I felt that as the patriarch  I needed to investigate and protect my family. My family members were all three asleep and I believe there may have been some snoring going on which may have given the creature some comfort to continue doing this.  I was sleeping in my underwear and decided to get dressed.  I got dressed more quietly than ever before or since and I am certain that I made no sound that the creature could hear.  I did not turn on any lights and was absolutely silent  feeling around for my clothes  shoes and pistol. Once dressed  I moved silently to the trailer door  being careful not to shake the trailer or create any noises.  This was actually quite easy because there is a door adjacent to my bed.  I waited until the cracking sound had receded as far away as it sounded like it was going to get.  And remember  the sound was emanating from the opposite side of my trailer.  I slowly opened the door  again careful not to make a noise.  The knocking sound continued. This is the part that freaks me out the most  as soon as I stepped outside  the knocking sound that seemed as far away from me as possible  stopped.  Now perhaps the trailer made a creaking sound when I put my weight on the metal step but I had the distinct feeling that something  another creature  had seen me get out of the trailer.  For some reason the door opening did not cause the sound to stop but when I got out  whatever was creating that cracking sound decided to stop even though it was 70 or 100 yards away.  I had the feeling that if something saw me  it would be beyond the rear of my trailer; the door that I just opened would have blocked the view of me from the front of the trailer.  A position to the rear would have nicely triangulated a view of me and of the wood knocking creature.  In short  I got the distinct impression that there was a second creature serving as lookout. Now the story does not stop there  I had a lousy flashlight (unlit) in one hand and my pistol in the other.  I proceeded around the front of my trailer to the other side.  Once I was on the other side  I was confronted by the pitch black woods in which I was certain that there were a couple of unknown creatures.  Having the distinct feeling that there was something to the rear of my trailer  I shinned the lousy flashlight directly towards the rear.  This only lit up the two very large pine trees that were about twelve feet in front of me.  Shining the flashlight did however elicit a response.  As soon as I shown the light  directly in front of me  but on the other side of the trees  perhaps about 20 to 40 yards away  something let out a â€œwhoop  whoopâ€.  It was clear  it was distinct and it was amazing.  Before this incident  I had never heard on TV that bigfoot made a â€œwhoop  whoopâ€ sound  so I am certain that this was not in my head.  At that moment  I knew that there was something different from an elk  a bear  an owl  etc that was disturbing my camp.  And I also knew that there was more than one.  I felt that this was an alert call signaling any additional creatures to leave the area. During my time outside of the trailer  I was conscious of the observances that bigfoot is supposed to smell.  I specifically sniffed the air trying to get an indication of a bad smell but never smelled anything.  It was a temperate night  the air was a bit cool  probably in the low 60â€™s but I didnâ€™t smell anything. Right after the â€œwhoop  whoopâ€  my wife began to stir  turning on lights and going to the restroom.  I went back around the front of the trailer near the door I exited from and my wife was standing there asking me what was going on.  I told her that â€œthere is something out here  I donâ€™t know what it is  but there is something out here.â€  Surprisingly  maybe because I knew they were scared away  I was able to fall asleep shortly thereafter.  My wife told me that before she went back to sleep that she heard a couple of knocks too.  Of  course I had told her what I had heard and it may have been fresh on her mind as she started to fall asleep.  She did wake me to tell me  but I didnâ€™t hear anything and we both fell asleep.  My brother and father -in-law never really woke up during the incident.  I would say the incident lasted about 10 minutes from the moment I first woke up until the â€œwhoop  whoopâ€ was heard. The next day  I searched the road and any sandy areas in the area for footprints.  I am an experienced animal tracker but found no tracks.  As we discussed the event I grabbed two ponderosa pine branches that I thought approximated what I heard.  I cracked them together and it sounded fairly similar.  I experimented with different sizes and materials (oak  aspen and pine).  I felt like 2 inch diameter pine sticks with the bark removed sounded closest to what I had heard. The last week of November that same year  my friend  his dad and brother were staying in my exact same campsite hunting elk.  My friend heard the 2 second wood knocking rhythm translating through the woods just like I had for quite a few minutes.  I believe his dad and brother did not really stir.  He did not go out to confront it and it eventually stopped. ,I do not wish to divulge the exact location. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no
142,It was in the middle of the night and I took my three kids camping.  I was awoken by a strange noise. The noises sounded like a angry female with a smoker  s voice scream in short bursts.  Probably 5 to 10 second bursts every 10 to 20 seconds.  The camping area where we were was near Lake Knoll Arizona.  You can check out my video on youtube of the campsite. Just google Lake Knoll camping.  It should be the first video.  I did not sleep the rest of the night.  I heard other noises later that night.  It sounded like multiple animals fighting but it was more animal sounding....maybe wild bores or something. I asked some of my hunter friends and they could not explain the first sound that I heard.  Other than those noises  there was not a sound to be heard.  It was dead quiet. ,This was in the Lake Knoll area.  We camped past the final turn to Lake Knoll on a narrow dirt road.  Instead of turning right to get to the lake  we kept on going straight. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no

144,My Wife and I went up to the Mogollon Rim north of Woods Canyon Lake to camp for two days. We took our two small dogs with us. I thought if we went during the week there wouldn  t be many people there and I was right. We set up camp in the rain at about 2pm. It rained till about 6pm we saw no one just these big trucks going back in forth on the road till about 5pm. It was very dark and we were trying to start a fire but everything was wet and all we had was a dull ax to chop wood. I believe we were being very noise hacking at the dead wood we were trying to cut to size for our fire. After we got the fire going we cook our dinner and ate. It was very quiet no sound at all then we saw a large full moon rising from the east it lit up the sky. We decided to go to bed around 10pm I put some more wood on the camp fire hoping it would burn all night. As we were in our tent the moon was like a big night light then we fell asleep. At about 3 10am I woke up to a sound that was unlike anything I have ever heard both our dogs sat up and were very still. It was like as if someone was screaming thru a loud PA system it was very clear. I woke my wife so she could hear the sound but it had stop then again it started we were both laying there trying to figure out what could be large in size that would make a sound so loud and long it was echoing in the canyon to the north of us. Then it stop it must of lasted about 5 to 10 min at the most. We stayed in our tent for about a 1/2hr but we both needed to GO if you know what I mean. So we put our shoes on I grab my wife  s 9mm and we stepped out of our tent we could see all around us because of the full moon light. After taking care of business we went back into our tent and went to bed. I wont lie it was hard to me to fall asleep. The next morning after breakfast I took one of our dogs out for a walk in the direction the screams came from and saw nothing but about 200yard in the same direction I found what looked to be a possible shelter made from dead trees about 12 to 15 feet long and 4 to 5  in diameter. they were set up standing like a teepee there was one tree laying on the ground next to the structure I tried to lift it and found it was so heavy that I don  t think two large men could pick it up much less stand it up like the rest. One other thing I saw was the trees were saw cut but there were no tree stumps around so the trees had to be carried there from else where. If someone did this for fun they had to work hard to do this and I cant see why. The first night we were there no one was camping any where near us but the second day we were there some campers set up about 1/2 mile to the north on the other side of the canyon. That night our dogs were on edge looking out away from camp and growling my wife said she could hear something large moving around in the woods to the west of us but when shining a spot light in that direction she didn  t see anything. I put some more wood on our fire then we went to bed. The next morning we got up and made breakfast took our time cleaning up our camp site then packed and left for home. ,The specific camp site location is  withheld. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,yes
145,While in flagstaff  AZ  my husband  mother-in-law  and I decided to take a chairlift ride. As we drove up snow bowl rd to reach the Arizona Snowbowl  we saw a large tall figure walking in long strides through the trees. I would say about 40 yards from the desolate road. As an avid  Finding Bigfoot  watcher  our sighting was everything we heard/saw on the show. The squatch had to have been at least 8 or 9 feet tall. It was too far away to make out any features  but the way it walked  the posture  and dark brown/black color it was unmistakeable. Definitely not a bear or deer. We saw the creature take two long strides through the trees and  disappear . A feeling came over us of shock/fear/amazement. I had goosebumps all over my body. ,Halfway up Snowbowl Rd.  before reaching the Arizona Snowbowl chairlifts. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,yes
146,It was a Sunday afternoon and I went to stay at a cabin we rented with my two children for the night.  We were escaping the heat of Phoenix and it was a beautiful day  clear  sunny and no rain or clouds. That night we were asleep in the cabin but I kept waking up because I was on a very uncomfortable cot.  As I lay there trying to fall asleep again  I heard what sounded like a â€œwhoopâ€.  This was followed by a clear wood knock sound.  They were about 8-10 seconds apart.  I lay there listening and about 1 minute later  I heard the same â€œwhoopâ€ and again  followed up by another knock about 10 seconds later.   They seemed to both come from the same direction (SE of the cabin).  I was the only one who heard it as the kids were asleep and I didnâ€™t tell them as I didnâ€™t want to spook them.   The sounds sounded close  Iâ€™m guessing within 50 yards since I was able to hear them while inside the cabin. There are a few other things that make this significant and eerie. One was that from the time we arrived at the cabin  there was no wildlife or sounds. Just birds chirping and the occasional wind blowing through the pine trees.  We never heard a crack in the woods or any other wildlife sound. It was just quiet. So when I heard this  it stood out because we heard nothing all afternoon  evening or at night.  Another is that as we drove down the road to the cabin we saw only 2-3 other camping parties along the roughly 12 mile stretch to get to the cabin.  It was Sunday afternoon about 2PM when we drove to the cabin.  But when we left the next morning about 7AM  they had all left â€“ assumedly the previous afternoon since it was a Sunday.  So we were the only ones in the area 12 miles back in the woods.  We passed one truck near the main road as we left Monday morning but that was it. Lastly was another noise we heard that I didnâ€™t put much credence in until after I heard the whoops.  It was about 10 30 earlier that night  shortly after we climbed in bed. I was trying to fall asleep while the two kids were playing games on their ipods.  All of a sudden a rap noise hit the window on the south side of the cabin.  Immediately  the kids look at me and say â€œwhat was that?!â€ The sound was like a small pebble hitting the window.  Again  it was clear and no wind.  I played it off to the kids that it was probably just a moth or bug hitting the window and it may have been just that.  But then I heard the whoop and knocks later in the night and wondered if something was watching us. Whenever we camp  we always set up a camera trap for the fun of it to see what wanders in to the camp. I did so on this night too and it was set up in front of the cabin but it had zero hits on it.  Not sure what all this adds up to.  The thing hitting the window could have just been a bug.  But the whoop and knocks I have no explanation for and I clearly heard them. ,The witness requested not to disclose the location. ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,no
147,It was a Sunday afternoon in late June 2016. I was camped in a developed USFS campground (CG) on the Coconino National Forest in central Arizona in the Mogollon Rim area. The CG is situated in an canyon within a mixed forest of spruce  fir  oak  aspen  and mainly Ponderosa pine. The cliff edge of the Rim is about 3/4 mile South of the CG. I was sitting in the shade and had just finished reading a work of fiction by James Patterson which had a strange ending. I was musing about the ending and just looking West across the CG when a very fast moving dark figure crossed the CG heading from North to South. My first thought was of a large kid on a bicycle as it was moving so fast on the in camp gravel road. But its   travel path was counter to the road. Then I realized what it was that I had seen. It was a very large Bigfoot. The sighting only lasted about three seconds and I was very lucky to have seen it at all. It crossed the CG in a shaded area and blended well into its   background but the meadow beyond it to the West was bathed in afternoon Sunlight and backlit the dark figure. It was about 125 yards from my viewpoint so facial detail was not clear. It ran with a slight forward cant to its   body. I noted that the head did not bob up and down like a human runners head at speed. The coat was almost black looking but with the back lighting I noticed a slight reddish tint to the figures profile as it passed by. I had not noticed its legs or arm movement. Later  I went over to where the figure had crossed. On the North side of the drainage area  there was an area of crushed grass near the beginning of the travel path. Then the figure had moved South across the in camp road and had gone into a depression in the high grass. There were other areas of crushed grass along its   suspected travel path. Also a crushed fern near the split rail fence that bordered the CG where I suspect it had stepped over  crossed the forest road  and went into thick timber. I believe the Earth depression and a row of large logs obscurred my view of its  legs as it passed by. I had only seen its   torso from the hips up but did note that the figure did not appear to have much of a neck  if any. The torso was very thick and I guessed it was a least twice the thickness of a human. It was a once in a lifetime event and as I said  I was very lucky to have seen the Sasquatch at all. Truly  an awesome event which I will carry in my minds eye forever. ,The sighting was in the Kehl Springs CG at Mile Post #7 (GPS info was taken and is available upon request) ,Coconino,34,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4005,yes
148,I have hunted  hiked and camped the sierra anchas since the early 70s. I found a fresh track in the mud on the old homestead that was about one and a half times my shoesize and I wear a 11eee. Biggest and heaviest I ever saw of a human like print. It was fresh and I didnt want to be around there if it came back. I have camped in the old barn there and heard heavy footsteps about 2am in the morning  but didnt see anything in the morning cept for trampled grass. Also another time my neighbors heard growling in the brush while camping there and left. Not to far from there next to another homestead with another orchard like the previous one I heard all kinds of big rocks being thrown and tearing around in the brush  I retreated quickly. I found a deer that had all been torn up another time the legs been ripped of and something had been eating just parts of it which was puzzling to me as I have seen lion and coyote kills. A forest employee said somebody had been pushing down the hiking trail signs and now I am wondering. In 1981 I came home from a successful deer hunting trip and was about 10-15 miles north of globe heading there when I came around the corner and there was a dark figure standing there about 10 yards off the road on my side. The eye shine was bright red and frightened me. I slowed down to back up but decided no  I have a deer in the back that needs skinning and my pregnant wife was with me and I decided to skattle out of there. I had forgotton all about these incidents until I read the reports and it came back to me. I didnt think about bigfoots in Az. ,The old peterson homestead on aztec peak it can be found on older topo maps. ,Gila,6,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4007,yes
149,It was between Christmas and New Year  s Day 1983 at about 8 00 P.M.  I went to pick up a friend at her parents home for an evening out  about one half miles south of Strawbery  Arizona off of Highway 87. There is a dirt lane that leads between a quarter to a half mile from the highway to their home.  This lane cuts through a ponderosa pine forest. It was on this lane on our way back to the highway that we saw the sasquatch. He entered from out of the woods on our left  crossed the dirt lane in front of us and entered into the woods on our right. Although it was after dark  we were able to see him quite clearly in our headlights. We were moving slowly. I would estimate him to have been about 7 feet tall and to have weighted about 400 pounds.  He was covered in a light colored hair  similar to that of a camel in color. He walked upright on two legs and had the gait of a human  as his arms swung in time with his steps. He never looked directly at us  but continued to look stright ahead and to maintain his stride across the lane.  He did not seem to appear scared or startled by the presence of our car or it  s headlights. It was as if he knew that he had time to cross the lane in front of us. His body shape was not like that of a bear. It was proportioned to that of a man of that height and weight  but it had a barrel chest.  My friend and I were both surprised by it  but were not uneasy about it because he did not make any meancing jestures. It seemed like it paid no attention toward us at all. My biggest regret now is that I did not return the next day to look for footprints.  Even though he did not appear meancing  I certainly would not have followed him into the woods.  I  ve often wondered if he could have possiblely used our headlights on purpose to illuminate his path across the lane. I know that this report is twenty years old  but it is an accurate and true account of what we saw and I hope that it is of some use to you in your research. Strawberry is located on the slope of the Mogollon Rim at an elevation of approximately 5000 feet.  I lived in Pine  Arizona at this time. Strawberry is only two miles away  but increases in elevation by 500 feet. Payson is the nearest town of any size and is 17  miles to the south.  The forest here has the third largest stand of ponderosa pine in the world. ,One quarter mile off of highway 87 at a point one half mile south of Strawberry  Arizona and one and one half mile north of Pine  Arizona.

150,I have two incidents I  d like to relate.  They both took place in Arizona  but were in locations miles apart and were separated by years. I was born and raised in Colorado and have been an outdoorsman my entire life.  I have camped and hiked in just about every state west of the Mississipi no matter the weather or season.  And most of the time  I  ve been by myself.  I  ve always preferred camping and hiking alone.  Most of the time  weather depending  I rarely use a tent when alone.  I  ve been that way since I was 16.  I once lived in a VW Bus for a year travelling throughout Wyoming  Montana  Idaho  Washington  British Columbia  Oregon and Northern California  mainly camping in remote areas I found by exploring logging roads  two-tracks or what have you.  I  d explored much of Utah and Northern Arizona mainly by myself.  I know the outdoors and the animals which inhabit it. I  ve been a BF believer since I was 13 when I first saw a still from the Patterson film in a Readers Digest.  I  ve read numerous books on the subject (John Green  Rene Dahinden  etc.) and during each of my travels through the PNW I  ve always kept alert for any signs or sounds  but I  ve never seriously expected anything. I was married in 1988 and my (now ex) wife and I moved to Arizona in 1990 because of a work transfer.  We immediately set out to explore Arizona.  In 1991 on a camping trip in the Bradshaw mountains I was awakened about 1 30 in the morning by a sound I did not recognize.  Where we were camped was on a level spot about 40 yards off of a forest road.  I  d backed the truck off of the road and we carried the gear further off the road to a point where the land dropped to a steep slope to the west.  On the other side of the forest road was a ridge that sloped steeply up from the road to the east.  It was in a transition zone between forest and desert.  There was sparce timber and a lot of scrub pinons. The sound that awakened me was coming from the ridge overlooking our campsite.  It was a high pitched noise repeated over and over again at irregular intervals of perhaps 30 seconds to several minutes.  As I listened  there was a return call coming from the slope below our camp.  Whatever they were  they were calling back and forth to each other.  I laid there for about half an hour listening to the exchange.  The sound from the top of the ridge would move back and forth as if it were pacing in wide swings along the ridgetop.  At times you could hear a large intake of breath.  The sound from below also moved  but I couldn  t get a feel for how it was moving. I  d been listening to the sounds for about half and hour when my wife (never much of a camper) startled me by asking me in a very concerned voice what the noise was.  I didn  t know she was awake.  She aparently knew that I was.  I told her I didn  t know  which surprised her.  I suggested that maybe it was some kind of desert night bird or something  but she didn  t accept that and as we listened to the two different calls she grew more and more nervous.  At one point we heard a little trickle of rocks down the slope above us and she had had enough.  We waited until the sound above us had moved away again and made a sprint for the truck.  We spent the rest of the night in the truck.  Just before daybreak we could hear the sounds moving off into the distance (to the north) both above and below us.  After the sun had come up we went back into the tent and slept for a while.  When we woke up I looked at our campsite and I could see that there was a trail that came down the slope across from our site  went across our site  and down the slope we were camped on top of.  I did not go up to the ridgetop as it was very steep and my wife did not want me to go or leave her alone. When back at work I asked around if anyone had ever heard sounds like that and what it could have been.  No one could explain the noises. Several years later I found this site and during the course of exploring the site I found the sound recordings and played them.  The recording titled  Scream   1998 from Columbiana County  Ohio sounded very familiar to me  but I wasn  t sure.  So I got my (ex by then) wife and went through the WAV files leaving that one til last  and watched her reaction to them.  When she heard that particular recording she visibly paled and her mouth opened.  She said that was exactly what we had heard that night  only there were two of them calling back and forth. That recording is the most similar thing I  ve heard to what we heard that night.  My ex-wife is adament that was the sound we heard that night. The other incident occurred a year and a half ago.  I was participating in a group camping trip northeast of Phoenix by the Mogollon Rim.  There were about 20 people there and the first night was a pretty raucous evening.  About 10 30 I got fed up with the noise and partying and I put my backpack on and told the woman I had gone with (she also was trying to sleep) that I was heading out and that I  d be back in the morning.  I walked out of camp and about three quarters of a mile down a trail that dead ends near the rim.  I didn  t think anything about it.  I didn  t use a flashlight as it was a beautiful night and was starlit enough to see my way.  After I  d been walking for a while and the noise of the group had faded out I began to feel uneasy.  For no real reason.  Just began to feel  un-nerved.  I take a pistol with me camping  but I  d left it locked in my truck because there were children there also. I found a level spot next to the trail and bedded down for the night  which passed uneventfully except for the palpable feeling of uneasyness which I convinced myself was paranoia.  I  ve had the jitters before on solo camping trips and convinced myself that  s all it was. The following night camp was a bit more subdued.  After dark  as there were fire restrictions in place  everyone pooled their lanterns and we gathered in a large circle talking and chatting.  The weather was extremely calm and the air was absolutely still. It was not long after we  d gathered that the odor came into camp.  The closest thing I can equate it to is the stench of a meatpacking plant.  It came out of nowhere and there was no reason for it being there.  We  d been there for a day and a half and had not smelled anything until that night.  At first  for me  it was highly curious.  It would drift into and out of camp with varying degrees of intensity.  The rest of the crowd was unconcerned about it and seemed not to care  making jokes about it and laughing it off.  There was another woman friend there who had been a firefighter for the forest service who was mystified by it also  suggesting that maybe it was a bear or something.  I  ve been relatively close to bears before and I hadn  t smelled anything remotely like that before. All of a sudden it dawned on me what it could possibly be  having read numerous reports regarding the stench of BF.  And this smell fit the descriptions perfectly.  It was rancid.  And it seemed to move.  I began pacing the perimeter of the camp with a flashlight shining it off into the woods  but never saw or heard anything. Anyway  I guess the woman I  d gone with noticed that I seemed agitated and asked me what was up and I guess my reaction startled her.  She and I had been camping together for about 3 years after my divorce and she had never before seen me afraid and in fact getting up in the middle of the night to investigate noises had become a routine with us (which at first frightened her terribly but after watching a herd of elk move through a draw near one of our camps in the middle of the night  a couple of head of cattle on another camp  and a small herd of deer with fawns on yet another camping trip  she  s gotten to the point where she likes to see what is out there in the dark).  She told me later that she could not have ever imagined me being afraid in the outdoors. But that smell totally un-nerved me.  I tried not to show it with the group there  but she and the firefighter lady saw it in me.  At one point they asked me if I was going to hike out again and (they both told me later) that the vehemence of my  no freaking way  startled both of them. The odor stayed around the camp for several hours and then inexplicably disappeared.  By the time we were heading to the tents there wasn  t a trace of it  but I had been completely un-nerved  especially when thinking of the feeling I had experienced on that trail the previous night.  That uneasy feeling is apparently common during BF encounters. And I still am.  I now find that the thought of heading out by myself scares me to death.  To the point where I haven  t gone out solo since that night. Which is one of the reasons I  m writing this.  I know the fear I feel is psychological and may be based on nothing.  But I feel that I know what that smell was.  Nothing I know of smells like that.  Nothing that will come around a large group of people anyway.  I desperately wish I  d seen something that night so I would know one way or another. I  ve debated about submitting these incidents  but I finally decided that writing about them might be cathartic and help me get over this irrational fear I  ve developed.  I know that most of what I have written is inconclusive and is largely subjective  but it was real enough for me to scare me right out of the woods.  A place which used to be my source of oxygen.  And now my curiosity about all this has me wanting to go back and find out what the hell is out there.  Especially after reading about the Arizona sightings. I apologize for the length of this largely uninformative submittal  but sharing this seems to have made me feel better.  At least for now.  Thank you for your patience. , ,Gila,6,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4007,no
151,I was staying in my trailer on my friends property  their house was just slightly uphill from where my trailer was parked.They only came up on weekends  because of this i was there alone most of the time.They had a motion sensor light on there porch that would turn on whenever anything would get close to the house. Numerous times it would turn on so after a while i started sneaking uphill to see what was triggering it. Being in the forest there I got to see all kinds of animals (elk deer fox coyotes etc.) without them seeing or smelling me because of the way the hill was I could peer over the crest unnoticed. One night the light went on  I was like cool lets see what animal is there this time. When i got to the top of the hill and peered over there was a giant human like silouette standing about 50 feet from me 20 feet from the house it howled/screamed/growled like nothing i ever heard before i turned and ran as fast as i could. I was terrified! What convinced me it was bigfoot was the size shape and sound later that week on tv an Oregon audio recording of supposed bigfoot was the sound i heard exactly. Im 100% convinced it was bigfoot.The following day i did look for prints but it was june and bone dry during fire season so i found nothing. ,I do not want the location posted online. ,Gila,6,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4007,no
152,It was standing on the side of the road  as if it was waiting to cross.  It was standing next to a large diamond road sign that I believe is about 7 feet tall.  It was taller than the sign by a head  making it about 8 feet tall.  It was illuminated by the side lights on my car  so I didn  t see much definition in the face  but I saw a good outline of the head  and I saw a distinct large head that was not particularly pointed  but was sloping. The shoulders were massive and boxy.  The arms were long and hung down to the knees.  It was light colored  almost the color of the oak leaves in the fall.  The hair was short  about 3-4 inches long  and normal in distribution-it was not bushy.  I say  it  because I didn  t notice any anatomy. ,after Payson  in the Little Green Valley area  where the divided highway merges together  just before you start heading up the rim. ,Gila,6,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4007,yes
153,I had never thought about reporting this until I read about the reports on Mt Graham. Lived in the Gila Valley as a child. Visited Mt Graham as a child with relatives from Michigan. I was 10 years old. I was sitting on a log with a slope behind me. Started feeling  funny   like something was watching me. Family called me back to the car  I glanced up behind me and there was something huge and dark partially behind a boulder right up the slope from me. I ran as fast as I could. It was hairy and tall. I hadn  t heard anything before the sighting occurred. I told everyone and was told I was seeing things. I have never forgotten that visit to Mt. Graham. As an adult I am still freaked out up there. I know what I saw  it was not a bear! It was large  dark and hairy. I have looked into Bigfoot sightings before  but never connected it with Mt. Graham. I do now! ,I don  t remember  nor was I paying attention. We had turned off on a dirt trail and hiked back a bit. We were not at the Riggs Lake yet and we were past the first major cabin area. ,Graham,8,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4009,yes
154,Camping in small pop-up trailer  my wife woke to the sounds of what she thought to be a heavy-set man laughing  she thought it was just another camper  but the sounds turned into some sort of crazy psycho laughing  then she got scared. In the morning she asked me if I heard the noise  I did not. I told her it was just a couple of critters fighting or something. Then a few months or so go by and I was watching a show about bigfoot  on the show they played a recording taken by a hunter  as they played it  my wife comes from the kitchen  white as a ghost and says  That  s what I heard on Mt. Graham . So now I know it was not some small critter  and we just stored it away. A few months ago we got our first computer  going to your site I see another in the same area. Just wanted to run this by you to see if it can help. ,191 to 366 up the mt. to Riggs Flat Lake ,Graham,8,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4009,yes
155,Two buddies and I were camping on the top of Mt. Graham in an undeveloped campsite just past the turnoff for Riggs Flat Lake.  It was the middle of September  1995. The first night we were sitting around our campfire at about 10 00 pm when we all heard a loud unidentified blood curdling scream.  It was like nothing we had heard before - not human or any other animal like an elk or something that we had heard before.  The noise came from about 200-300 feet in the distance.  We heard the scream about two or three times over the course of 15 minutes.  We all commented about the noise like   what was that?   But  we just kind of laughed it off. Later that night  at about 2-3 am  we were sleeping in the tent when we heard  something big   creeping behind our tent.  It was definitely bipedal  because we could hear the pine needles crunching under the footsteps of whatever it was.  You could also tell it was big and had some weight to it.  We were so creeped out that I grabbed my 9 mm pistol and cocked it  and when we got the nerve we stuck our heads out of the tent and looked around.  Nothing was there. The next morning I looked for footprints  but couldn  t see any because of the pineneedles covering the ground.  The next night the same thing happened at about the same time - something big on two legs was walking outside of our tent.  When we looked out it was gone. ,Take route 366 to the top of Mt. Graham.

156,I was on my way to work on a Monday morning. I had to leave a little early because of the snow and fog. I was leaving from near the Mt. Graham foothills headed towards Safford traveling about 15 mph. The fog was so heavy I could bearly see. I flipped my brights on to try and see better but it only made it worse.  when i turned them off I saw a hairy man like creature run across the road. It had to be at least 7ft. tall. I couldn  t get a good look at it beacuse it vanished into the fog.  I know for certain it wasn  t a human. , ,Graham,8,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4009,yes
157,My friends and i were camping on Mt. Graham  around the ******* [place name removed by editor] area. I was raised in that area as a child and I came back to visit with some long time friends that remain living in the safford  Az area. We were up for the weekend doing the usual camping thing in close vicinity of *******.  It was about 0100-0130 time frame  when all six of us heard some very weird sounds that sounded like no other thing I have ever heard  mind you I was a infantry soldier for 13 years  always out in the wilderness and never once have I heard something so freaky. I was kinda worried  but we all laughed it off and got back to our conversation. Not a hour later  we heard it again  really loud and really mad sounding  whatever it was. It was very close  like right behind us breaking branches and making those crazy sounds. My buddy got into his truck and turned the headlights on. It quit. We all slept in our vehicles that night. The next morning there were broken branches behind us  big thick ones to the size of baseball bats  really weird. I don  t know what it was  but my one friend said he has been on this site before and it sounded like one recording that is on this site. ,[Exact location removed] ,Graham,8,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4009,no
158,Memorial Day weekend 2013.  Arrived with my husband and two kids to Cunningham site Mt Graham on May 25 2013.  Two relatives campers were already at the site set up.  We only had a 5 person tent and a car.  May 25 was uneventful we camped  ate walked two dogs had birthday party at night with son.  May 26  got up early spent time in camp having coffee  did normal camping activities  except around 1030 am went for hike with my husband  daughter(12)  son(11).  Our campsite was in front of the restrooms at Cunningham site and we hiked the trail behind the restroom on the right. Walked to trail for less than a block and stopped in front of wild raspberry bushes.  My husband commented on how he used to go eat these when he was a kid camping in the Graham  s.  Started walking again  went up a hill  my daughter hit her walking stick on a tree. Seconds later  a large tree is heard falling up in the forest nearby at top of hill above us.  We walked a short way and then decided that it was too steep and turned around.  Went back to raspberry bush and took pictures for a few moments.  Went back to site as we were walking back I was in the back of the group and heard a twig snap behind me as if someone was there.  I turned around to watch but nothing was seen.  This occurred twice.  Went to camp had uneventful day.  Went to bed in our tent around 9 pm.  One camper that was behind our tent (we had our tent on the corner of the road by the bathrooms.) went home in the early afternoon.  With one camper left to our left  we were close to the forest by the bathroom.  We went to bed  opening of tent was to the forest.   Slept on the left side on a cot.  Dogs and kids went to bed quickly.  I finally nodded off to sleep.  Around 1 or 2 am my husband woke up and needed air.  He stepped outside the tent with his flashlight and was there for about 2 minutes.  As he came into the tent his flashlight was shining around the tent. Seconds later a person  s figure was seen walking quickly in front where my husband was just standing.  My daughter and I were both awake and said  someone is outside . She heard slipper feet nearby the tent on the road. We went back to sleep.  I awoke later do not know what time to hear someone behind the tent eating. There is no vegetation just trees.  It was chewing and lip smacking loudly  like someone with no manners.  our tent has side panels which are open but with a tarp on top of our tent because the night before was very cold.  I could tell that it was tall because it was above me  and tried to listen to identify it. No bear  no deer not footstep sound.  About 15 minutes later  a sound was heard down the road.  The chewing stopped.  Resumed chewing a minute later. This went on for awhile  no other animal sounds  no birds even though a mexican whippoorwill was singing all night the night before.  I turned toward the sound and smelled out the netting and it smelled like an animal.  Later  a sound was heard in the distance like someone was out of there camper door.  The chewing stopped  the thing was gone without a sound  no footsteps.  I went back to sleep. My family talked about it the next day  but went on with our activities and left that day. I had no knowledge of bigfoot in southern Arizona prior to looking it up a few days after getting home.  My friend joked when I got home that if was Bigfoot.  I went on line to look up Mr. Graham bigfoot. What a surprise I got.  My husband does not believe in any of this  no bigfoot  ghosts  see contact info below. ,Cunnigham site  in front of restrooms on corner ,Graham,8,Arizona ,AZ,Spring ,4009,no
159,I was camping at Mt. Graham about 1 00 am when I awoke and heard some rhythmic tapping of some type.  About 30 yards away in a very wooded area. Seconds later I heard steps walking around my tent. No breathing occurred just the sound of something walking. And it never went into the reflection of my tent and my lantern light. My sister  husband  son and their hound dog were in a tent 10 feet away and I could hear their dog whimpering.  I awaken my dad and told him I think its a bear. So we got our shoes  gun and flashlight. My 3 nieces were sleeping in the tent adjacent to my sister  s tent. Then from inside this tent my niece screamed. (Later they told us they all heard steps and heavy breathing  and heard sounds from two individuals she said sounded like they where communicating and could hear them run away.) When we heard my niece yell in fear we got out of the tent fast with our flashlight aiming in their direction. But it was gone. It had to move extremely fast or just be hiding and did not make a sound because we were out of the tent in 2 seconds of the scream. We were already getting up to check some noise and do the late night restroom when at 4 00 am we could hear rocks and chattering within 1 second about 50 yards in the dense wooded area. ,Mt.

160,One night while driving near a canal  down a road near South Mountain Park in Phoenix  my friend and I saw a large black creature with a burly body walking on all fours or dragging it  s front limbs like an ape cross the road in front of us. It looked at us with a face similar to a Sasquatch or orangutan and then was lost in the darkness. I was driving a Volkswagen bug and it was as large as my car. ,Between Baseline Road and South Mountain Park  at the intersection of 16th Street and the Canal.

161,This happened in Gila Bend Arizona. My sister and her friend had went horseback riding down to the river bottom just north of the farm we lived on. I decided to ride out and meet them  so I took out one of our real gentle horses that never got excited and jumped on him bareback. My parents two dogs (rottweilers) were with me. When I got to the North end of the farm I had to turn west and ride parallel with the Gila River. There was a barbed wire fence between me and the river bottom. On the other side of the fence was overgrown with salt cedar trees. There was a cement ditch on the other side of the road which lead to a big sump full of farm run off water. When we got close to an opening in the fence  the two dogs started sniffing the air and acted a little excited and the horse was getting real antsy. I thought they could smell the other horses and I was close to them. All of a sudden the horse just stopped and started trying to rear up and when I looked around the dogs were gone. They had started running through the field back toward my parents   house. I heard something and looked at the trees and standing behind a tree looking straight at me was what I thought was a gorilla  then it stepped from behind the tree in full view. It was very tall because the fence didn  t even reach the top of its leg  and it was covered from head to toe in long brown hair that was all matted and had salt cedar branches tangled in it. It just stood there looking at me  with a curious look on its face. I held the horse as long as I could hold him and just stared back trying to comprehend what I was seeing. I was riding bareback and knew I couldn  t stay on much longer if I didn  t get away. I let the horse take off running to get to the road leading back to the house. We had to run about a quarter of mile along the river and this horse was in a full out run  yet this thing seemed to be staying with us through the salt cedars. It was running on two legs along the fence just inside the trees with us. When I turned on the road toward the house I looked back and it was just standing there. I ran all the way home and told my dad and brother who laughed at me and told me I was just seeing things. They did however drive down to the river bottom looking for my sister and her friend. They didn  t see or find anything as far as what I had seen. My sister and her friend said when they were coming out of the river their horses were acting scared but they didn  t see anything. A few years later  my dad and my uncle had found a strange set of large bare foot tracks with what appeared to have claws in the mud near the same location.  ,It was North of a farm on the North side of Watermelon road  that ended where the river bed starts. ,Maricopa,6,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4013,yes
162,My sister  her husband and I were driving home from Bartlet lake after some night fishing.  It was around 12 30 a.m.  We were on a dirt road with tall embankments on either side.  My sister was driving slow and we were both looking at my bro-in-law while he told a joke.  Out of the corner of my eye I spotted something in the middle of the road. About 50 yards away in our head lights I turned and saw it!  I have never seen one before but somehow I immediately knew what I was looking at.  It WAS a bigfoot.  It was around 7 feet tall. Walked up-right.  Cow red.  Long straggly dirty hair.  It was acclimated for the desert because his hair was very thin not thick like a bear.  It didn  t seem to pay us no mind as he crossed the road in only a few strides.  What sticks out in my mind the most is how it got up the steep embankment with no effort. It just walked right over it. The sighting only lasted a few seconds but seemed to go in slow motion.  I always thought that bigfoot was a hoax.  For me seeing is believing.  I am a true believer now because I DID see it.  I feel very fortunate for this experience. , ,Maricopa,6,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4013,yes
163, OBSERVED  About 1998  I don  t remember the month  but it was cool and at night.  I  d written the incident down  but I can  t find it right now.  Anyway  we were driving on Baseline Rd.  between 51 Ave. & 67 Ave. going west.  Myself  my wife  and nephew  saw maybe two cars swerve around in the road ahead. As we approached  I slowed down  and then a creature stepped across half the road in front of us and into and across a small canal and onto a golf course. By then I had turned my scout around deciding to use 51 Ave. instead of using 67 Ave.  I asked every one what they saw and their response was  bigfoot  except for my wife who just wanted out of the area.  As far as the description  it was big and tall with dark matted stringy hair.  I could not see its face very well  because I was too busy turning the scout around. The creature didn  t seem to care if we were there  it just stepped across the road ignoring the cars.  There is very little traffic in this area at night. ,At the cotton fields and the golf course on Baseline and 59 Ave  ,Maricopa,6,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4013,yes
164,Me and and buddy were driving from my house to his house which was about 15 miles  it was around 2 30 in the morning and i was driving  he was half sleep in the other seat  about 5 miles from his house we were driving by the budweiser factory and i looked over on the right hand side of the road and saw something large and greyish  standing the side of the road staring at our vehicle as we came closer  when we were about 20 to 30 feet from it  it turned around and started running through the field at a fast pace  it scared the crapt out of us and my buddy started freaking out more than me  i know its something ive never seen before and i know it wasent someone dressed up in some crazy gorilla looking costume  this thing was large and had to be at least 7ft tall  it was hairy with laid down looking greyish hair with long arms almost down to its knees  if i had to guess it was a male and he looked around 500 to 600 pounds at least  i couldnt see its face really good but i saw his glowing eyes as we came closer to it with the headlights shinning on it  i told a couple people about it and my buddy doesent speak about it no more but its haunting having to see something like that on the side of the road starring at you ,I-10 to gila bend down to baseline rd on the right side of the highway ,Maricopa,6,Arizona ,AZ,Spring ,4013,yes
165,My roomate and I were moving from Austin Tx to Olympia Wa. We left Austin at 8 30 am and headed west driving straight through the night. Honestly it was a long day of driving which is what makes this story interesting. We were both on about six red bulls to stay alert for the long nights drive and all seemed normal. About 40 miles north of Phoenix I went around a corner and saw what I thought was a bigfoot standing motionless on the side of the road. This was a highway that had many large rocks that could look like the creature if you were tired enough however this large object had eyes that reflected off my head lights. The creature was a light brown color much like the sand and rocks it was standing around. I didn  t want my roomate to make fun of me or think I was crazy so I said nothing about my sighting and continued on for about another hour until we stopped in Kingman and bunked down for the night. Once we checked into the hotel we tried falling asleep but after drinking that much red bull neither of us could fall asleep. As we continued to try and sleep we discussed what a long day it was and my roomate remarked I was so tired I thought I saw bigfoot. He described the same location as my sighting. I rarely speak to anyone about this incident do to the fact that they think I am making it up but I know what I saw and I was not the only one. Bigfoot is indeed real. ,About half way between Kingman and Phoenix right where the road bends before the bridge ,Mohave,2,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4015,yes
166,WELL ME AND MY FAMILY WERE ALL OUT CAMPING AND FISHING AT A GREAT LAKE THATS IN SHOW LOW AZ CALLED FOOLS HOLLOW LAKE.

167,Was out for a run a couple of weeks ago and during my cool down I noticed what might be footprints in some dried mud. I have pictures and will send them if needed  most of the area is flat with some surrounding hills and low trees (juniper  oak  ect.). I  m unsure whether or not these are actual tracks due to the many other obvious boot and shoe prints in the same area; but  a few of the tracks have what looks like toe impressions and all are fairly large. All were bigger than my size 13 shoe  there is also a sighting reported in the same area on this website  October 2006 Navajo County  AZ near Cibecue. I live right behind the school and about 1/2 mile away from the old airport and have heard numerous stories  including one about two months before of three people seeing one sasquatch cross the road  and people seeing a sasquatch near the school dumpsters. ,Following BIA 12 up past the high school football field pavement comes to an end  about 50 yards from the pavement there is a small rarely traveled road off to the right.

168,I was driving towards Show Low on US 60 about 2 00 in the afternoon on March 24th  2010. I always look out into the trees in hopes of seeing deer and turkeys  but this time I saw something a bit more out of the ordinary. I saw a very large and tall animal which was about the same redish brown color as a Herford cow  standing about halfway behind a large pine tree. Its arm was very long and it was probably 7ft or more in height. I hit the brakes and slowed way down to get a better look and when doing so  it rotated to make itself more hidden from view. It was too large for the tree it was behind  and now it was visible on both sides of the tree. It definately saw me. I couldn  t see its eyes  but it kept its head visible to look at me. Cars were coming so I had to move on. ,Approximately mile marker 330 on the west side of US 60. About 30 yards off the road. ,Navajo,6,Arizona ,AZ,Spring ,4017,yes
169,I was walking my dog and I went to the end of Mcneil road here in Show Low AZ. I went down into a ravine thaen back up to the main mesa behind the city park. I came around a bend on a trail and Billy growled and pulled to the left. I saw some motion out of the edge of my eye. I saw something tanny colored with a red tint. For all of 2 seconds I thought it was an elk or dear. I have came up on them before and they aren  t as quiet as people think. It left way too quiet. I was very freaked out ,I know that bear cant run on 2 legs and this tree this thing was behind could not hide something going from 4 to 2. Dang it was gone like a ninja. ,Navajo,6,Arizona ,AZ,Spring ,4017,yes
170,On approximately April 22 14 I was at Fools Hollow Lake near Showlow  AZ I was out on the lake around the bend fishing where a storm was starting to roll in from the east as the storm was getting closer I was becoming more uncomfortable so I decided to start heading in. I was heading west when I spotted what I thought was a bear down on all four drinking water from the edge of the lake my approximate coordinates were 34.277763  -110.071018 and when I first spotted the creature its coordinates were 34.277126  -110.072090 off the point at the bend of the lake (the lake is a sideways  L  shape. As I got closer to the creature still thinking it was a large black bear I saw it stand up on its two hind legs and look towards me. The creature then turned and walked into the wooded area behind it where I lost sight of it. The small time frame in which I did see the creature walking depicted very similarly to the Patterson video this creature about 7-8   tall longer arm length reaching towards its mid thigh and walking with a very long stride and a hunch. The creature appeared to have a reddish brown color to it a few shades darker than an orangutan. After losing sight of the creature I was unable to catch it in my sight again. With the storm right behind me and lightning all around I did not want to be on the lake in a 12   aluminum boat so I headed back to shore. ,34.277126  -110.072090 ,Navajo,6,Arizona ,AZ,Spring ,4017,yes
171,My father and I along with one of his close friends named Chuck were hunting along the San Pedro River off of Charlstone Road midway between Sierra Vista and Tombstone. I was only 9 years old at the time but still can recall the events of that day. As we were walking along the river (not really a river but more a large creek)  we all came to a sudden stop when we heard this  animal or thing  scream so loud that it made me freeze. I look at my father to see that he had turned ash white along with his friend Chuck. My father quickly changed out his shotgun shell for a mangum load. We beat a hasty retreat out of there and called it a day. The scream I remember was a VERY loud single scream that lasted for maybe 5-7 seconds. My father and his friend (very experienced hunters) had never heard of any animal in all the years they had been hunting sound as this did  dying or alive  to include mountain lion  bobcat  coyote  bear  rabbit  etc. At the time I did not know that my fathers friend Chuck had seen movement in some mesquite trees about 30 yards away from the direction the sound was coming from. As we departed the area  Chuck saw large footprints in the sand of the San Pedro River  I am not sure how he did now see them before... My father passed away in 1997 and I have told this story to many of my friends and to my wife and kids with the same reaction ... nice story . Anyway  I retired from the military in 2003 and moved back to Sierra Vista. One evening while at the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) with my friends and wife I ran into my father  s friend Chuck...I couldn  t believe it. After shaking hands and all the formalities  we caught up on old times. The bigfoot story came up and I had Chuck (who is now in his early 70  s) tell the story without my interference to my wife and friends and he recalled the events of that day pretty much the same way I had been telling it for years. I felt a bit vindicated that our stories jived and that I was not making this up. I really don  t know what it was all those years ago but I do remember the very sound scream this  thing  made in 1972. Hearing the scream together with the footprints in the sand I suppose equates to a bigfoot event I  m not sure but I know what I heard. ,As you travel Charlestone Road from Sierra Vista to Tombstone heading north east  stop at the San Pedro River bridge  and head north  probably about 1/3 mile along the west side banks of the San Pedro River. ,Cochise,2,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4003,no
172,It was my first day of the 1981 Navajo deer season. I have hunted these Lukachukai mountains for deer through my teenage years with brother T.  uncle DJ  and cousins. I was twenty years old then. It was about 7 A.M.  November 7  1981 when our hunting crew reached the top of the mountain  southwest of Cove  Arizona. The weather was cold with shifting fog  the ground was frozen from the drizzle  the night before. Two cousins and I were to walk the upper mountain ridge that arced to the northwest. I packed my day pack and loaded my rifle. By then my cousins had already walked ahead of me  on a well used trail  which rounded a hill to a saddle which splits the mountain range. I wanted to catch up with them  so instead of following the trail  I climbed up the hill and over. As I reached the top and began to go down the other side I stop and yelled my cousins name  s to locate them. I first heard crashing of oak brush  below me 40 to 50 yards to my left. I could not believe what I was seeing walk down hill on two legs. The oak brush was about armpit high on the thing. By then the smell had reached me. Which was musky  wet smelly hair  undescribable scent. I was shocked. The thought of shooting it came mind  as I watched it through my rifle scope  but it walked to similar to a human. I did not shoot. I watched it walk down  to the big trail below  about 70 to 80 yards and into the forest. I then hurriedly made my way down to the north  towards the forest road we came up on  and stayed on the road back to meeting area to the northwest end of the ridge. I think it followed  because of the movement I could hear in the oak brush while walking on the road. I shot once to scare what ever was moving  in the oak brush. What I saw  was a very large black hairy being that walked upright on two legs. The upper body was broad and muscular. The hair appeared coarse. The smell was bad. I can only say  what I saw that day was a bigfoot. ,Southwest of Cove  Arizona. Lukachukai Mountain range.

173,It was our annual summer camping trip and I was in the back of the car with my uncle.  My grandmother and grandfather were in the front and my grandma and uncle were sleeping.  I was staring out the side window and slightly forward.  While looking I saw a large animal that I thought was a bear.  It was only a very brief view but the animal was walking upright and was very furry.  I mentioned to my grandfather that I saw a  huge bear  walking upright but he laughed and said it must have been trying to climb a tree.  But there was a break in the trees where I saw the creature.  It looked like it was going off of the side of the road into the forest. I cannot be sure what it was.  But  it was so very odd that it certainly looked like it was  walking  on two legs.  It was dark so I couldn  t distinguish any other features. ,South of Big Lake on Road 273. ,Apache,11,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4001,yes
174,One summer morning of the year 1989  myself and a forestry technician were just finishing up a routine spotted owl survey in the northern part of the Chuska Mountain range.  After calling for owls at a call point  just before sunrise  we began to walk back to the vehicle when we heard a loud  deep yell/roar from down below our position.  The habitat was a mixed conifer stand within a deep dark canyon. Since there are sheep camps throughout the Chuska Mtn. range  it did cross our mind that perhaps someone (a human) was yelling but the distinct factor that myself and the technician had agreed upon was that the yell was very deep and long (lasted approx. 5 seconds). After the vocalization  the echo itself retained the deepness of the sound as it travelled through the canyon below us.  This was definately not a human that had the lung capacity to make such a sound. After researching it a bit more recently  about sasquatch sightings  audio clips etc.  my theory is the animal  whatever it was  may have been responding to our sounds  since we were calling with the imitated vocalization of the the Mexican Spotted Owl.  I  ve listened to several audio clips of recorded sasquatch vocalizations and can see where one may have mistaken us for another creature of its kind. ,exact location is unknown; spotted owl survey records from that time may indicate otherwise. ,Apache,11,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4001,no
175,Well this happened twice in our area  which is on the navajo reservation in the northeast corner of Arizona. Mid winter in 1979 myself and other neighborhood kids were playing in a recently fallen snow  and out of the darkness  was heard the most terribly and interesting scream that we  ve ever heard and this scream lasted for about 15 minutes on and off. Now at the time I remember their being reports of a giant Yei Men taking sheep from corals  but I didn  t believe until that night. The time must have been about 12 pm.  What is ironic about this incedent is that it did not only happen once but twice three years later in the same conditions. And  their were low key rumors at the time. Now this hasn  t bothered me but I sure would like to know how it ever wandered into our region for a fact. In our oral history our elders spoke of  Yei Men of  whom will come and take you away if your bad. I mean just put two and two together?  Now this had to be a Bigfoot  because on several recordings  the sounds are identical to what we heard that night!  And  even on an episode of sightings the night cry was identical. This just gives me the creeps  to know that at that time we were probably  being watched. ,In the mid valley of our community of which is densely surrounded by juniper and pine forests. ,Apache,11,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4001,no
176,On the Navajo Indian Reservation  I was driving along the washboard dirt road (7) that heads east along the south side of Canyon de Chelly looking for a place to duck into to camp for the night. I was about 7-10 miles east of Chinle driving at about 20 mph. It stepped out from the left side and walked across the road right in front of me  about 40 feet away or so  right at the edge of the bright part of my headlights  walking briskly but in no hurry crossing the road and slightly away from me at the same time so that it was probably 5 feet ahead when it reached the other side of the road. As soon as it crossed the road and the little swale of a ditch it bent over just as it was behind a bush as if to take cover as soon as possible.  At first  all I kept thinking was  I just saw an ape of some kind.  but I quickly realized what it had to be. It wasn  t particularly large  about six feet tall or so  but very solid for it  s size and uniformly covered in dark brown hair.  It never looked at me. I only saw it for about three or four seconds but saw it clearly. I ended up going back a little  turning north on a paved road that leads to the edge of the canyon  just a mile or so  and turning off into the woods a little to sleep in the back of my truck for the night just two or three miles at most from where the sighting occured. ,on the Navajo Indian Reservation on the western edge of the Chuska mountains ,Apache,11,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4001,yes
177,Myself and a friend were hunting this water hole where deer and elk come to drink. The location is approximately 7 miles north of the small community of Sawmill  Arizona on the Navajo Reservation. It was during the Archery Elk season on the Reservation of the very last day of the season which was Sunday. At about 6 00pm  we set up a small portable blind near the water hole and crawled inside. We waited quietly for about acouple of hours or so. We observed some cattle that came in to drink. There was also a coyote that came to drink. At 8 30pm  the sun went down behind the ponderosa trees. We decided to crawl out of the blind and break the blind down. As we were taking the portable blind down  we heard a high-pitched scream that came about 200 yards NW of the water hole. We stopped and listened thinking it was an bull elk. Again  the scream came 30 seconds after the first scream. Right then  I said  that don  t sound like a bull elk at all . As I said that  another scream came which seemed to lasted a lot longer. At this point in time  we decided to leave the area. We didn  t know if the scream was coming closer to our location.  ,This incident took place about 7 miles north of Sawmill   Arizona  on the White Clay Road after passing the power lines. Then its about 1 mile east off the road. ,Apache,11,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4001,no
178,My name is Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX I  m a chiropractor. One afternoon a few weeks back  I was on my way from Show Low  AZ to a ranch past Concho  AZ to work with a horse.  I  m certified in animal skeletal adjusting (chiropractic for animals.) Between the Y in the highway and Concho  about 6 miles outside of Concho  at about 2 30 PM  on a clear  sunny day (Oct. 26  2006)  I saw something come up onto the road about a half mile in front of me.  At first  I thought it might be a very large dog as it initially was coming up onto the road  but as it fully entered the highway  I could see that it stood straight up  to a height about as tall as a road sign  maybe 6 or 7 feet?  It had long  dark brown hair from top to bottom and stood absoulutely straight up  no slouch  no forward bending at all. It ran across the road from my right toward my left and remained fully standing as it ran off into the brush.  The full incident took maybe 10 seconds. The area I live in is plentiful with big animals - elk  deer  bear  big cats.  Many of my patients come to see me for injuries after auto encounters with these big animals.  I  ve had some very close calls myself.  During the 12 1/2 years I  ve lived here I  ve seen several animals I had never seen in the wild before.  Each one  including a coaty mundi  were immediately recognizable.  My far vision is incredibley good. It is my habit to drive hypervigilant for animals here. I  m quite familiar with bear movements since they are pretty well a nuisance to locals and spotted often here.  It  s the only other local animal that could have possibly fit the description as far as fur  color and standing height.  However  bear do not stand straight up to run across a road.  In fact  they don  t stand straight up.  When they stand  they sort of hunch and hang their front paws.  This did no such thing. Immediately  I was very confused because I thought it looked like how a sasquach is described  but I didn  t believe there might be any such thing as sasquach/bigfoot in Arizona of all places.  The Pacific Northwest  maybe  but Arizona?   It was beyond my conception. Since then  my wife and I have been looking for information on the web and have discovered that there have been sightings in this area for years by the White Mountain Apaches  who are generally pretty closed mouthed about it. In retrospect  I realize I should have stopped and searched for tangible evidence  but I had an appointment and didn  t want to be late. I am fully convinced of what I saw and confident in my observation capacities. ,Coming down off a slight rise.  The sides of the road were low  you would have to climb up onto the highway.  There were lots of junipers about 10 to 15 tall on both sides of the road.  I failed to get a road marker.  It happened so fast and I was so unprepared. ,Apache,11,Arizona ,AZ,Fall ,4001,yes
179,Although I have had very good class B encounters  this Class A sighting was something that I will treasure. On Feb. 1  2007 I took my husband to Show Low AZ to drop him off for 10 days with friends. The weather had been bad that day and progressively worsened so that I did not take my normal route back to N.M. which is through the White Mt. Apache Res. I went down U.S. Hiway 60  it runs between Show Low and Springerville AZ.  Past a small town called Vernon  the terrain loses almost all of the juniper trees and is mostly rolling grassy hills. I have learned a type of defensive driving in Elk country  wherein you keep alert to the peripheal vision movement. Something drew my attention to the left hand side of the road and I applied brake anticipating an animal (elk  deer  pronghorn etc.). What I saw made me turn and pay attention. It was bipedal and running dead at the road. I slowed as fast as possible and watched in open mouthed awe as the creature placed one hand on the t-post (metal pole used in barbed wire fencing) and vaulted over the fence  slowing very little and continued running. It crossed the road (2 lane black top) in maybe two full strides and kept going into a narrow canyon and beyond my sight. I pulled to the side of the road and called my husband. He could not believe what I was saying. He finally asked me to get out of the car and look for tracks or hair or solid evidence (once a cop always a cop). In very unladylike words I told him no.  I was alone  unarmed and unwilling to meet something that big on a road that I had seen fewer cars in two hours than I had fingers on my hands. The creature was dark brown and had longish hair. I never saw its face full on  it had to be close to seven feet tall or more. It never seemed to be afraid or running dead out.  More like a lope or steady jog. The weather was cold and heavily cloudy  mix of precip. off and on all day. No standing snow. It was around 1530-1600. ,Near a place where they are putting a new bridge  and a foresty raod intersects a little past that. ,Apache,11,Arizona ,AZ,Winter ,4001,yes
180,We were camping out with a couple of my cousins along with their kids on 4th of July weekend at Wheatfields Lake  east side of the lake. We got there on Friday evening which is July 3rd. we decided to camp there since there were alots of campers at the main campground which is located on the west side of the lake right off the highway. At 4 00am Saturday morning  my little boy woke and I started to tend to him. At 4 15am  my girlfriend and I were up sitting inside the tent feeding my little boy when we heard a loud low sounding roar coming near the west side campground. Immediately  some of the campers   dogs started to bark like crazy. I asked my girlfriend  did you hear that?   she replied  yes  what is it? It sounds scary . I told her that its something huge with a good set of lungs. We heard it about 5-6 times. Duration of the calls would last like 10 seconds long. About 5 minutes later  the call ceased. But we could still hear the dogs barking away. Then at 4 45am  we heard one more call from the same location. Afterwards  my girlfriend and my little boy went back to sleep while I stayed awake all morning. The next morning  I asked my cousins if they heard the calls and they said they didn  t. ,At Wheatfields Lake camping ground. ,Apache,11,Arizona ,AZ,Summer ,4001,no

182,Heading west on I-40 today at 0930 my wife and I saw a Bigfoot 100-150 yards from the hwy heading north. It was not running  but walking. It never looked at the hwy. It must have been 7-8 ft tall. It was thick  as in well built !  There was a rock outcropping behind it which made it very visible. There had to be other travelers who saw this also. We got a long look at it.  15-20 seconds. It was west of Houck AZ. GPS 35.179152  -109.465490 In Apache County  Arizona We were traveling in a 30 ft motorhome so I couldnâ€™t stop.

They are real and Iâ€™m a believer now. Itâ€™s hard to explain it to even family. Iâ€™m 62 years old and have nothing to gain by reporting this  except the fact that they should be documented and protected at all cost.

183,REPORT   In the summer of 1977  I was in the U.S Army  stationed at Fort Huachuca Arizona.  During this period of my military career  I was assigned to the post drill team.  As part of our duties we did functions such as parades  special ceremonies  and military funerals.  Fort Huachuca is approximately 70miles south of Tucson.  I remember it was a day in July  on a Saturday morning.  We had to do a funeral in some small town in Arizona.  I don  t remember the name of the town.  What I do remember is that it was a beautiful day  not a cloud in the sky  it was a perfect day.  If you know anything about Arizona  its desert  and on a clear day  you can see for miles. We loaded on to the military bus  and we started on our trip. Right out side the gate from Fort Huachuca is a small town called Sierra Vista  which is a small military town basically. There is a main road  that leads from Sierra Vista  that goes up to Highway 10  which is the major highway that runs through Arizona. I forget the highway number of the road that leads to Highway 10  but I  m sure if you look on any map  you could find that out. We turned left on the road and started to drive towards Highway 10  it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to get To Highway 10. After we got to Highway 10  we turned right  heading north on Highway 10. We were driving about 10 or 15 minutes  and suddenly  the bus starts to jerk. The driver pulls over  and there we are on the side of the road. Everyone got out of the bus but me. I was sitting on the left-hand side of the bus  or the driver  s side  looking out of the window at the passing traffic. On the far side of the road  I could see a big white house  with a road leading from it. (This is very important  because I  m sure that house is still there  I think it was some kind of ranch actually  but I remember that it was all white). Any way  I  m sitting there  looking across the road  and an 18wheeler  was coming up the far side of the road  on the other side  heading south. Just as the 18wheeler past  I saw something  coming up out of the gully  on the far side of the road. I  m sure you know how when you see something  first you see it  then your mind processes what it is. My first thought was  is that a bear?  Then as the thing kept coming up the embankment  I could see that it was walking on two feet  that  s when my mind then asked  is that Gorilla? I remember it was dark tan in color  with long hair  you could also see it was very muscular  and it had these long flowing arms. As it came up the embankment  it turned its head  and it was like time stopped. When I looked in its face  I actually saw man like features. It  s hard to explain  but it was like a big hairy man. From it facial expression  I could tell it was frightened. It actually ran with its head looking back for a good distance.  (Note  on the phone interview  John stated that he could also see his chest when it turned to look back at the highway.)  I truly believe that the sound of the 18wheeler scared it.  Back a little ways  I told you about the white house  and the road leading from it. I sat there  for oh  at least 45 seconds  watching it run up this road. You should have seen how fast it could run  and how long the stride  s were  it was amazing.  It was also a very hot that day  as days are in Arizona  but it was like it ran with ease.  Then it turned off the road to the left  and it was gone  into the desert.  I just sat there in disbelief for a long time  and then realized what I just witnessed  a sighting of Big foot itself. Needless to say  none of my friends saw it  because they were playing around on the other side of the bus. For the rest of the day  I could think about nothing but that. Later that night  when my mind was thinking clearer  I had time to make some assumptions. After my sighting occurred  I had time to think about what had happened. For some reason  this creature came down to the road  why I don  t know  but I don  t think it was trying to cross. From the look on its face  and the way it was running  I got the impression that the 18wheeler actually scared it. It was running full speed up the embankment. I truly think its curiosity got the best of it  until the sound of the big truck scared it. I also wondered why no one else on the bus or highway seen it  because it was so big. I don  t know how it got down in the gully. But  unless someone  just by chance looked out their passing car window  I could see why it went unseen.  I also noticed that the color of it  witch would make it very hard to notice especially in the dessert. If it saw someone coming  all it would have to do is knell down  and it would go unnoticed. An assumption of mine is that this creature has learned how to go unnoticed  I truly believe it is intelligent  and can probably get very close to humans without it even being detected. Another thing I must say is  other than a picture  foot prints  video  or a dead body  it is going to be very hard to prove this creature exist. As far as shooting one  I guess that is a possibility. But  if that does happen  it would have to be out of fright  or because a person thinks it a bear or something.  I say this because  if you look this creature in the face  you are going to see so many features that a man has  that it would be almost murder to shoot one  it is just so man like in the face. From the distance I was  it would be hard to say how tall it was  but I would put it over 6 foot easily. As far as the weight  it would be hard to estimate  but I would have to guess at least 300lbs. The thing that impressed me more than the face though  was it powerful build. Broad shoulders  wide body  and you could see the muscles in the arms  and its legs were very strong and muscular. After I had a long time to think about it  I almost felt sorry for the creature  because I can only imagine that it lives a lonely life  all alone.  I do think it enjoys its freedom though  and it is truly the ruler of its domain. In the end though I truly think we will find proof one day  if for nothing but because man is expanding all over the place  and this creatures curiosity with man  might get it into a situation it can not get out of. It is going to be very hard for this creature to hide forever  but for some reason I know it will try. I have had 20/20 vision all my life.  I again  have kept this too myself all my life because who would believe such a story  sometimes I don  t believe it myself. It  s funny now though.  Sometimes  I  m sitting around watching TV  and I see all the shows about whether Bigfoot is real or not. And  I just shake my head  because one day  man is going to get the shock of its life  because this man/creature is out there  I know  I saw it with my own eyes.  Again  I don  t want any recognition or fame  I just wanted to finally share this story with someone.  I also can not speak on the other sightings  as to their truthfulness or not.  What I do know is there is at least one in Arizona somewhere. One suggestion though is  if someone really got serious about finding this creature  with today  s technology  you would think it would be easier.  One technique I think would work is to go up in a helicopter of plain with infrared heat sensor equipment.  One thing I know is that it is a hot-blooded creature  and if someone could finance it  and have the patients to track it  I think you would hit pay dirt. Oh yeah  one other thing  Unless you drug this creature  or shoot it dead  I would hate to be on the team that tried to capture it.  From what I saw  if you corner this creature  it would have the strength to rip your head off your body.  Well I guess that  s it  if you have any further questions please feel free to ask. COMMENTS  First I would like to thank you for the wonderful information you have on your web site  you are doing a very good job. Though I can not vouch for any of your other stories  or sightings  what I can say is one day the hole world is going to get the shock of their lives.  Because  this man creature we call Big Foot does in fact exist  I know because I saw one with my own eyes in the summer of 1977  in Arizona. Like many  I did not believe my eyes. Till this day  I don  t know why God allowed me to see this creature  and I replay the seen in my mind almost everyday. The thing I will never forget though  is when the creature turned around  and I looked it right in the face. What I saw  is the thing that has stayed with me  because even though  I knew it was a wild creature  its face is so man like it will scare you. I saw intelligence  fear  and also saw that this creature is just as curious about us  as we are of them. For years I have kept this to myself  because who would believe me  they would think me crazy  as you probably do also. But  let me say this  I  m not looking for any recognition  fame or fortune. All I know  and can say  is that this man creature does exist  and one day  we all will find this out. ,About 10 to 15 min. northeast of the town of Benson  on Highway 10.

184,We had begun fishing along a slough a few weeks ago.and we had been catching some good fish along it so we descided to clear out our own spot for camping sessions along its bank. The strange things started happening about maybe a week ago now...We were night fishing along the bank when my friend Jacob spied something across the lake looking at us. I pulled the jeep up and shinned the headlights across the lake and he caught a glint of amber like eyes staring at us. He and Jonathon our other friend said the thing was massive. Saying it could have went eight to nine feet tall easily. It was haunched over in a set of dead grass that stood pretty high. It also had brown wavy furr but other than that I never got a look at it as it apparently fled before I could lay eyes on it. Now just last Friday we all descided to go camping and ignored the previous encounter from that night...We set up late in the evening with the cloudy skys rolling in. It rained on us a little bit but we ignored the bad weather and even grilled some burgers over our open pit fire. Me and Jonathon eventually left Jacob alone while we went out and cut some more wood. After we left my dog who is actually a small dog became real anxious according to Jacob. It would bark and howl towards the woods surronding us...then whimper and whine to my friend...Jacob said he felt like he was being watched but didnt wish to ruin our camping trip. He also smelled an oder because the wind just happened to shift for a moment..He says the oder was like a very smell gym rat after a hard work out...but perhaps magnified by ten. We returned shortly after and eventually I took Jacob home because of his uneasyness. Jonathon and I stayed till about 1 Am when the encounter actually happened. We never saw anything though...Jonathon had been sawing down a small tree for more firewood when a loud whooping/moaning sound echoed just thirty feet behind us. The sound was unrecognizeable as any animal we had ever heard and we have both spent many hours in the woods hunting. He and I debated the sound on the other side of the fire nearest to the water when it came again this time much louder and deeper...sounded even closer. I told him it was time to leave as the hair on the back of our necks stood up. I pulled my dog out of the tent...The dog is usually very hyper and happy but on this night he cowered and refused to leave the santuary of the tent. Once out of the jeep he acted very quiet and sat in the backseat unmoving. I was so afraid by this point I clambered into the passanger seat instead of going around to the drivers side where the sound was heard...We took off and left all of our camping gear...The bad feelings we had seemed to disappear once we had left the area. We came back the next day with our camp in good order still but my tent which had been zipped up at the time was open..I looked for any sort of sign but could not see anything other than the burger patties were missing. Also an old hoe we used to shovel up leaves was half way burnt...It had broken on us that night but we moved it well away from the fire..It was found near the fire and partly burnt. We also found what looked like a foot print near the area of the sound but we could not really identify it...It was bigger than my foot though and I wear size 13s. ,The location is down south of Belleville.

186,My friend James and I were fishing in one of his dad  s ponds. We were frustrated that nothing was biting and had finally moved to the last of about 7 ponds. We had been there for about half an hour when we started hearing a whoop whoop sound and then some lound knocking like two tree trunks being banged together. We both made comments about what it might be but thought much of it. While I was browsing your site I found the recordings. I listened to the whoop and knock on that one recording and almost fell out of my chair. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD!!! The whoop and the knocks were identical to those sounds we heard just above and behind us. It was that far from us but there was a hill that kept us from seeing anything. It was completely wooded in the area the sound came from. ,i was following james to his house so i can  t be sure but i can find out ,White,16,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5145,no
187,At around 9 p.m. at night  I was standing outside of my house in rural Washington Co.  AR right near the Madison Co. border.  While standing in the yard  I heard a noise from the woods north of my yard (16 acres of my 24 were wooded) that sounded like a hooting/deep throated howl coming from the tree line.  This noise occured about three times withine a 15 second time frame.  At the time  my wife had just left the property about two weeks prior  and I briefly considered the noise to be made by my grandfather  who lived next door.  I shouted toward the tree-line   Hey  that  s a good way for an old man to get shot!   Afterwards  the hooting/howling occured twice more.  My dogs  two coonhounds  a rat terrier  and shephard mut  all bolted from the porch and headed to the treeline  barking and growling as if they saw something.  I ran to the house and grabbed my .22 rifle.  Running out the front door and angling west along the tree line  I noticed my dogs  dogging  something along the woodline  with the brush and tree limbs thrashing.  I followed this  thrashing  line of of brush approx. 1500 along the woodline in the pasture behind my house.  As I tramped along  I realized that my dogs were still barking vehemently  yet they were still in the confines of the yard.  I was alone along the tree line with my brush-thrashing guest in the dark.  I paused and observed the continued  limb thrashing  progressing toward the west of the property.  Also  during this run  I could hear thumping footsteps as if someone were wearing heavy boots.  In sudden realization of my potential vuneralbility  I returned to my house  where-upon I immediately phoned my next-door grandparents.  My grandmother answered the phone.  I said   That was really funny!   She said   What?  I told her of my theory of my granddad hiding in the woods to scare me.  She said   Well  he  s sitting right here  ain  t been out all night.   Indeed  I spoke with him  and he certainly did not have time to make it back to the house and decrease his rate of breath (75 yrs. of age) within that time frame.  I believe that I walked out of the house and disturbed an exploring sasquatch. ,This property is just off of AR State Hwy 45 at the Washington/Madison County Border. ,Washington,54,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,1129,yes
188,August of 2017 me and my son were fishing in a secluded creek. The creek is very shallow in spots so in order to access it you have to wade fish. We fished around a low water bridge for maybe an hour and decided to head up stream to the next deep hole of water just over some shoals. I knew that around the bend of the creek where the deep hole was there was lily pads  so I instructed my son to be very slow and quiet on our approach so not to spook any bass that may be feeding around them. Once we made the bend I observed what at first seemed to be a beaver about 50-75 yards away from us upstream where the water is deeper. It was headed toward some large rocks but what seemed unusual about it was itâ€™s shape. It was higher out of the water than any beaver or otter Iâ€™ve seen. The animal got close to the rocks and just stopped about a foot or two away from the cluster of rocks just in the water. If I hadnâ€™t seen it moving to begin with it would have blended in very well with the rocks. I noticed my son was watching it too and and asked what is that and I replied that I wasnâ€™t for sure so I made some racket with some cattle calls to maybe spook it on to the rocks so we could get a better view of this thing but what happened next still sends me into a mild state of fear just recalling it. It started swimming back to the opposite bank and just stopped for about a second then it rose out of the water. Now I know what I was looking at was massive because the water in that part of the creek is chest deep and I vividly recall seeing the daylight between itâ€™s legs. It stood there probably 3 seconds at most but the image was burnt into my brain forever. It had a reddish tint to its fur and massive arms that just hung to its side almost touching the water. I couldnâ€™t see any facial features because the sun was behind it. After what I felt was a stare down it lunged toward the bank that it originally came from which was an erosion bank about 10 feet vertical wall and it made it up using a tree about a foot diameter to pull itself with. Doing so it pulled the tree  roots and all  down to the water. We heard it storming off in the thickets till we couldnâ€™t hear it any more. My son and I wasted no time getting back to the truck. Havenâ€™t been back to that spot since. Now what Iâ€™m guessing it was at the creek doing what ever it was doing and we caught it by surprise and it mimicked a beaver trying not to be discovered. I always heard about these things and thought it be something to see one. I wish now I hadnâ€™t seen it. It filled me with terror and excitement but who can you tell? My son hardly talks about it and I keep it all bottled up inside my head like a re run of some horror movie...... ,Hanover road approximately 8 miles to the second low water bridge  go up stream past the first set of shoals to the deeper hole of water ,Stone,5,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5137,yes
189,I got up one morning in August and decided to walk next door to my mother  s home.  When I walked through the bedroom door  I noticed that she had a gun lying next to her on the bed.  She immediately began telling me that something had been outside her window the previous night.  She stated that she felt someone watching her and she then heard movement outside her bedroom window.  She then described a smell to me.  She said that it smelled like a cross between a wet dog and a  pole cat  (skunk).  I wasn  t exactly sure what to think so I walked outside and began to look around.  Right outside of my mother  s bedroom window was the most exact footprint.  I was shape like a human footprint but with no arch  like someone flat footed.  I measured the print and took photos.  It was 17 inches long and approximately 7 1/2 inches wide at the ball of the foot.  It was very distinct. ,Beck Spur area between Forrest City and Palestine. ,St. Francis,1,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5123,yes
190,Let me start by saying that I hesitate to tell my story to you but I need to.  When I moved to DeQueen  Arkansas in 1987 I was told about a story of a  wildman  that some of the locals called this thing described as a big  hairy  wild man.  A girl that I knew swore that while parked out in the country it came up behind her car and bounced it up and down by putting hands on the trunk.  She was terrified.  About 2 miles from where she said that happened  I had an experience myself. It was very isolated and in an area of deep woods  prior to Weyerhouser coming in and clearcutting a lot of the forest.  Some logging had been done  and some of the pine trees were growing back and were 8 to 10 feet tall. My friend and I were about 18 years old and went out to this place which was on an old logging road that went out into the woods about 1/2 mile and just had a turn around spot.  It was a very rough road that you had to go slowly down  especially in my car.  I would typically drive with my foot on the brake to get in there. Me and my friend went out there to talk because his girlfriend was pregnant and he didn  t know what to do.  There was a full moon that night.  I got out and went to the back of the car to urinate.  Thats when I heard the footsteps.  Something was walking through the woods  obviously on two legs.  The noise of the steps was weird because I could hear each step so loud.  I remember thinking that is a two legged something going  step  step  step .  It seemed to be quite a ways away from the sounds I heard  like maybe 60 yards.  But  as it approached  the heavy footfalls became obvious that it was not a deer.  It was walking on two legs.  Then  I saw it moving thru the trees.  It was like a huge man.  It stopped about 20 yards from me and looked at me over the top of the pine trees.  I could see the big black eyes shining in the moonlight and the head.  It was a large head and I didn  t stay for long.  I had a primal  fight or flight  experience and a dose of adrenaline that I didn  t know was possible.  Scared me so bad I didn  t even get my pants zipped up before I jumped in my car  started it  and floored it.  I nearly drug my oil pan off going out on this road about 35 mph.  My friend thought I had lost my mind.  When I hit the paved road  my car spun halfway around.  I regained control and floored it again.  I couldn  t even tell him until we were a few miles down the road. I went back the next day with my older brother with guns and a tape measure and showed him the spot.  The trees where I saw this thing were 9 and 10  feet tall.  His head was just over the top of the trees and the lower face was at the top.  I never went back there at night and didn  t talk about it for a long time. I know in my heart that it was a bigfoot.  I know without a doubt that I heard him  saw him thru the pines walking for about 10 seconds  and then he stopped and stared at me.  I could see the shape easily because it was a full moon.  I  m not exactly sure on the date that I submitted.  It was approximately October of 1989.  He was like a big man walking behind those trees.  I remember seeing the arms swinging and the two legs moving.  There was no smell and the eyes didn  t glow red--just black shiny eyeballs.  Big eyes too.  I never went back after my brother and I went back the next day. ,It was a place that the road was blocked off by the police by a barrier because the high school kids were going out there to party.

191,It was was around fall of 1986 I and my friends were 16 years of age. My friend had a relative visiting from the big city life of Florida  so me having a crush on her. Me and my friend took her for a ride out in the country back roads so I could mengal and get to know her. It was kind of the Dukes of Hazard atmosphere on a dirt road for miles going to a lake. There was a hill on the left side with alot of trees and pasture on the right side with a barbwire fence. I was driving a little old ford ranger pick-up truck with a stick shift in the middle. She was in the middle and my friend was on the passenger side. Me being a teenage boy thinking it would be cool to scare her (thinking that will make her like me.) I turned the head lights off and when I looked up I saw it walking across the road a distance ahead of us toward the pasture. The girl went balistic screaming and climbing all around making it hard for me to get to the lights. That was the only time I saw it because I was struggling for the lights looking down. I did see it for about 5 seconds and I was traveling at about 40 mph. I was totaly stunned by what I saw and my friend was trying to get her to come down  she just kept on screaming. When she did stop she kept on crying asking us over and over if we seen it. When she told us what she seen it was the exact same thing that I saw. My friend told her she was crazy until I told him I saw it too. After that we skipped the lake and didn  t go back for about a year and a half. It is still like a film in my mind today. ,We were heading east toward Booneville Lake. ,Sebastian,2,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5131,yes
192,I was in the Arkansas Ozarks this fall just touring around checking out different streams to fish. I had gone into the Richland Creek area and parked in the primitive campground. I was alone and didn  t see anyone else here at that time. Anyway I found a trail and took it heading downstream from the campground. I had read that there were bears in the area so I really payed attention to my surroundings. It had rained the night before leaving the trail wet and it seemed that no one had been on the trail that day due to the lack of footprints. I left the trail two or three times to climb down into the creek to fish. It was very rocky terrain. I had gone about a mile down from the camground on the trail. When I got down into the creek I noticied a small area of very small gravel about 5 by 10 feet on the edge of the creek and decided to look for animal tracks. I saw four round prints in a small group that were not very detailed in the soft gravel. Then I saw a very large  18 inches or more  print looking very much like a foot right on the edge of the water a few feet away from the other prints. This  footprint  was about 4 inches deep and full of water. It lacked any detail in the gravel except that it had very definite  entire edges and was shaped like a human foot. Well  I reached for my camera to shoot it  then I laughed to myself thinking people would think I was crazy. I mean at the time I did think it was funny and I discounted it on the spot. I did look around for more prints but the rest of the creek bed in the immediate area was solid rock. I had a long drive ahead that day and blew it off. It wasn  t until I got back home to Dallas that I really had to stop and wonder about what I had seen. I felt like an idiot for not photographing it! I haven  t been able to come up with a logical explaination for it such as an animal digging or a tipped over rock. Nothing. I told a few friends about it. I guess some people considered me sane still. My older brother seems to think I  ve been in the outdoors enough to know what I  m looking at. Who knows? , ,Searcy,2,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5129,yes
193,My uncle and I  who is only 2 years older than me  were playing on the hay bales that his neighbor always stored in the field between their houses in the sprign before gardening time.  Each house stands on a hill with a larger hill behind them.  The whole area was one huge field with a few trees here and there untill you got to the top of the big hill in back.  That is where the forest begins.  I was looking at the trees while my uncle was getting something when I noticed a large bipedal figure leaning against one of the trees.  My first impression was that it was a bear untill I noticed that the arm it was leaning against the tree with was straight out at a 90 degree angle to the body.  After a few more seconds of looking I realized it was roughly human shape but very large.  It was so far away I couldnt say how big exactly but having seen a truck on the hill before it had to be at least 7 feet tall.  I observed it for several minutes before my unlce returned.  I pointed it out to him and we watched it together for several more minutes.  We finally became too frightened to stay and run to the house to tell his dad.(my step grandfather)  He didnt believe us untill the family realised we were scared stiff.  He got a pair of binoculars and went out behind the house to look but the creature had left.  It occured to me later that the creature had been watching us play for an indeterminate time before I noticed it. ,Just a few miles west of Benton I-30 splits with I-70.  The house is just about a mile from the junction on the right hand side of the road. ,Saline,12,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5125,yes
194,My dog started barking at something on the hill  that is where the road is up on a ridge  our property descended down at a slope of about 20 degrees.  When dog started barking he would usually run up the hill to investigate  but not this time. I had tamed this dog which was 1/2 shepherd & 1/2 Wolf. The dog was the leader of a Wolf pack at one time & that dog wasn  t afraid of anything  but he would not leave the yard. The dog had a son about 2 years old & he was whimpering under the house. I would have never seen this if the dog had not have been barking. The creature was walking along the road on the hill about 200 yards away. The creature stopped and looked at us then turned & started walking down the hill toward the dog.  Well  about 20   off the road we had an electric fence & on this fence we used copper-steel-weld wire  copper coated steal basically  you could pull a car with stuff. The creature walked through the fence like it was honey suckle vine. I heard the fence break one second later & I heard the sounds of it falling all across the hill  it makes weird sound when I breaks.  The creature looked down & around then looked I me and I am still standing there scared stiff not knowing if I should move of not  then it turns & begins to walk a lot faster in the other direction  it was only seconds until the creature disappeared over the hill.  Later that day  after my parents got home  I went up the hill with my dad to look for any evidence  but there was drought that year & the ground was so dry there were no footprints.  I did notice the tree limb the creature walked under  that was only a foot from its head  but was too high for me to reach  at least 9  . ,Randolph county between Pocahontas & Imboden AR about 1 1/2 miles down Squrriel Rd. ,Randolph,16,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,1111,yes
195,I  ve had two possible bigfoot encounters. The first occured in 1975 when I seven.  My family lived at Little Rock AFB. At the time there were woods behind our house and a small lake as well.  After school one day I was playing in my backyard. I looked up toward the woods and saw something squatting down next to a tree looking at me.  It was covered in black hair except on its face and had as I remember a  flattened nose and pointed head. I was stunned.  I turned and ran into my house where I told my mom that I had just seen a gorilla.  I knew that it wasn  t a gorilla but that was the only thing I could think of to describe it.  My mom thought I was playing around and didn  t really believe me.  When I looked back there again it was gone. ,The incident was in Pulaski County.  Even though it happened at a military installation there were plenty of woods behind our house. ,Pulaski,15,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5119,yes
196,It was during  modern gun  deer season  probably about 3 years ago. I really can  t remember the exact year.  I was walking along a road that intersects two fields that were within the Piney Creek Wildlife Area.  These were basically clearcut fields  yet they always appeared to me to be well maintained.  I think this is probably because the land was very close to private property.  I was walking on this road when something in front of me just caught my eye.  There was a shape on the ground that appeared to be a footprint.  There was also another impression at the edge of one of the fields.  In other words  there was an inmpression leaving one field and then an impression (footprint?) in the middle of the road.  I don  t know why it caught my attention like that  nothing like that really has before  nor has it since.  I decided to turn around and leave.  When i got home  however  I just couldn  t get what I had seen out of my mind. The next morning my wife and i had to go up to Jasper  but on the way i told her that I wanted to stop and get some pictures of that impression.  It was only about two miles off of Highway 7 on one of the gravel roads which goes into the wildlife area.  In order to get to where i had seen this impression though  i had to leave my wife and little girl with the truck parked on the gravel road and then walk about three hundred yards down a narrow road.  This is a road that enters between the two fields  goes through them and then end at the end of the fields.  You can  t get a two wheel drive truck down into them because 4 wheel drives had cut ruts down where the road enters the field.  Thus you can  t turn the truck around hardly.  The impression was still there  so i laid my shotgun down beside it for scale  and took some photographs.  I also placed my size 10 boot beside the print.  It was little if any longer than my boot  however much wider than my bare foot would be.  The unique thing though  and this is what really got me  is that there were only three toes.  After I was finished  I headed back to the truck where my wife and little girl was. When i got to the truck  my wife said that  when she got out of the truck for a moment  she saw something further up the gravel road on the opposite side that I was on.  The growth was about waist high and she said it was crouched down in the growth looking at her.  When it saw her look  it stood up (whirling around at the same time) and disappeared back into the edge of the woods which bordered real close to the road.  I asked her what it looked like and she stated that it had the face of a human  yet also like that of a monkey.  She also said that it had hair on it  s body.  I asked her how big it was and she stated that it really was not much bigger than a person.  It was just crouching there watching her.  The last thing she commented on was how fast it was.  She said that it was extremely fast. I have wondered what it was that she saw  and if perhaps it was connected to the impressions that I observed.  I also wondered if perhaps it was in the process of coming to the edge of that gravel road in order to cross it.  This would have brought it in the proximaty of the impression that i found.  When it saw my wife and truck sitting there it may have just crouched doen hoping not to be seen. I really don  t know what i photographed or whether or not what i photographed is really a footprint.  My wife is pretty insistent however on what she saw. On a last note; before posting this  I did some checking on web sites and read various things that people say they observed or noticed.  I can  t say that I smelled anything that day or even thought that something might be watching me.  I hunted Piney a long time before that incident and have done so often since then as well.  Except for that impression  I have never seen or noticed anything which was out of the ordinary.  I have heard rumors of sightings though.  Rumors which never really bothered me or that I even thought about.  They still don  t bother me but i can  t say that i don  t wonder now. ,Go up hwy 7 North above dover  turn right onto gravel road at the National Forest sign.

198,My son  s father and I came over from Oklahoma to the Buffalo National River area. I picked a waterfall out of my waterfall guide book that we were going to go find. We chose Hideout Hollow. When we pulled up to the parking area at the trailhead he turned off the car. Our windows were down because we were both smoking a cigarette. At that time I heard what sounded like if you were in the bathroom and heard your dog sniffing under the door.  I asked him in a whisper â€œDid you hear that?â€  He said â€œThat sounded like heavy machinery off in the distance.â€  I let it go because I was just grateful he acknowledged the sound. We started to head down the trail when I realized we left our hiking sticks in the car  so I ran to get them myself. I had a slightly creeped out feeling but didnâ€™t worry about it too much because I could still see him the whole time. Once I got back to him we started down the trail. We were just starting to round the corner that goes to the left when we heard a rustling in the trees to our left. We both stopped started and looked. We saw a huge figure running through the trees. I thought it was a man at first until I realized it was totally covered in hair  medium chocolate brown in color. I remember seeing itâ€™s arms in front of it as if it was moving branches away to protect its face and its hands were black. I whispered â€œwhat was that?â€ He whispered back â€œI have no ideaâ€ I whispered â€œdo you wanna go back?â€ And he nodded his head yes quickly. The direction it was going  it wouldâ€™ve crossed the trail just around the curve. We turned around and started walking quickly back towards the car  both of us constantly looking over our shoulder behind us. I started asking questions to make sure we saw the same thing and neither of us forgot. We agreed it was on its hind legs  it was brown  it was a lot bigger than us and it was fast. Suddenly something flew fast over our heads (a rock?) hitting leaves and branches. I turned at looked at my son  s dad with a â€œwhat the heck?â€ look on my face and his eyes were huge. We ran the rest of the way to the car. I had never been so scared and I wasnâ€™t sure we would make it back to the car. We did and immediately he began second guessing what we had just seen  suggesting maybe it was a bear  a deer  an elk  etc. I asked him if heâ€™s ever seen a bear run like that on itâ€™s hind legs  or a deer or elk that dark running that smooth  he said no. We went to the Tea Kettle falls area but I was too scared and anxious to get out of the car again  convinced whatever it was could have easily covered ground by then. A Google search once we had service said only black bears live in Arkansas and Iâ€™m positive what we saw was brown. I didnâ€™t notice any smells but since we were talking I also didnâ€™t notice if it was quiet or if any birds or bugs were chirping. I know I have no desire to return to the area  I get sick to my stomach any time I think about it. ,Hideout Hollow Trailhead ,Newton,5,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5101,yes
199,at the time i saw this i was driving an 18 wheeler on highway 71 south of fouke ark near the crossing of the sulpher river going north at around 1 am the headlights of my rig picked out what i thought wat a dead tree trunk about 6ft or so tall off the right side of the road next to the water. i saw eyes shining in the headlites and thought it must be an owl or something in the tree but as i got closer the  tree  walked off into the swamp i never saw anything so weird as i went by the  place it had been something screemed load enough i could hear it over the sound of the truck with the windows closed and i sure wasn  t going back to see what it was. , ,Miller,7,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5091,no
200,I observed a hairy manlike creature approximately 8 foot tall walking away from me. It had sticks and leaves matted in its thick reddish brown hair. the wind was blowing my way and i smelt a very distinct musky smell. I was very frightened when it stopped and looked in my direction. I had a gun but would never shoot anything unless it is game. I now carry a video camera but have not had an opportunity to observe it again.

201,I was driving around the backroads of fouke and the jonesville area  it was a saturday late evening just before dark. I was looking over all the damaged trees that were still down from the Ice storm we had in this area during christmas.As I came near boggy creek it was getting somewhat dark  so I decited to turn around and head back home. I pulled into a dirt drive in front of a hunting lease to turn around and suddenly I heard a Howling sound like I never heard before. It was then dark to where I could not see threw the trees anymore so I decited to get home. Later on I was able to listen to some sound recordings of bigfoot and just as I thought  I got a rare chance to hear the real thing. ,3 to 5 miles due west of Fouke near boggy creek. ,Miller,7,Arkansas ,AR,Winter ,5091,yes
202,I  m probably going to regret telling this story. Everyone I know will probably laugh me out of the country. I myself for many years would hooraw and laugh every time someone would mention these creatures. Here it goes. I live in Northeast Texas not far from Texarkana. I haved lived in the Texarkana area for quite some time. I don  t coonhunt anymore my business has become more demanding. Coonhunting is a sport that really demands a lot of time. I found I didn  t have the time to devote to it so I got rid of my Walker hounds. I was so into the sport at one time I had hunting Licenses in 3 states. I had several Night Champions to my credit. Several years ago on a cold night in Jan/Feb I believe it was in 2000 - don  t remember the exact date. I was coonhunting in Miller County  Arkansas. I don  t know exactly how far from Mercer Bayou we were but I know we were in an area the ole timers call Thornton Wells. While we were hunting in this flooded timber  our dogs split treed. I went to my dogs who had treed on the other side of the swamp.The other guys went to their dogs on the other side. I got to the tree my dogs were treeing at and looked at my coon and caught my dogs. Everthing seemed ok so I decided to amble back toward the others. I could just barely hear their dogs treeing way across the bayou. Suddenly I heard something walking in the flooded timber. (Bare in mind this whole area is 8-15 inches flooded with brackish swamp water.) I could tell by the gate that it was someone coming in the flooded woods. So I called out to them thinking it must of been one of my hunting companions. To my dismay no one answered - instead all I heard was a deep throated gurgling growl and the awfullest putrid smell. The smell was like when you kill a wild hog and grab him by the hind leg and then you give out dragging him and put your hand up to your nose and the smell knocks you over. I also heard a whining kind of a whistling sound. My dogs were on my leash and were whimpering. Now these weren  t just any dogs. These were UKC Lipper bred Walkers  they probably weighed in at close to a 100lbs.They would could rip a 20lb coon apart. Yet there they were cowardly crouched behind my legs whimpering. I knew I had seen them tear coyotes to shreads that had tried to come into a tree where they were treeing. I couldn  t understand it. Still in all I was not concerned about any of this and got my dogs and started back across the swamp. After a few mintues I heard this sound of someone or something walking in the water again. So I stopped and turned around and standing right behind me was a creature of immense size. He must have been at least 8 or 9 ft tall. He was covered from head to toe with a real dark hair and when my coonbuster coon light hit in the eyes his eyes glowed like a deer in a spotlight. Talking about the hair on the back of your neck standing up  I was scared. I don  t ever remember being that scared. He made a hissing sound and reached down and took his hand and started scooping water and throwing it up at me and making a deep throaty noise. My dogs started chomping at the leash and growling trying to get at it  having regained their bravery. I grabbed the leash and tore out across that swamp so scared that for awhile I went in the wrong direction. I got to a big Cypress knee and caught my breath. I could hear the thing behind me sounded like it was about a 100 yards or so back. It followed me for a ways then after a while I could hear it across the bayou making a moaning sound and moving away slowly. I got my breath and my compass and my bearings and started back to the truck. When I got there I didn  t say a word to my friends about what I saw and heard for fear they would laugh me down. Needless to say I never returned to Thorton Wells nor do I plan to. For a long time I kept this to myself I even had nightmares about it. The only person I ever told was an old coonhunter from Doddridge  Ark. He  s dead and gone now but I do remember something he said to me that day. He said  if you  re smart you  ll keep that to yourself I know from experience that people will laugh at you and call you a liar. I  ve hunted in the Sulphur River bottoms many nights but never have I seen anything like that before or since. I  m not one for tall tales but I thought I would share this terrifying ordeal with you all because it seems we might have something in common. ,Close to Miller County Wildlife Management Area  not far from Mercer Bayou in an area called Thorton Wells not far from Fouke  Ark between 71 and Old Blackmon Ferry Rd. ,Miller,7,Arkansas ,AR,Winter ,5091,yes
203,A family member was driving west around four am in the morning  when the creature crossed the road in front of the car.

205,It was about 3 30 pm. and I was driving a backroad to Wal-Mart.  There is a spot where I always look to see if traffic is coming in my direction.  I looked up and saw a really tall man in what I thought was an old fashioned sweat suit with the hood up.  My first thought was why is he hunched over  then why was he wearing a sweat suite as it was 88 degrees out. I thought nothing of it until his arm stretched out behind him and I was like no way is that human.  It was very  very tall  medium to dark gray  and just didn  t seem like a person. It took me less than twenty seconds to reach where he would cross  but I say nothing.  This was on August 8  2018.  Since that time  every time I take that road  I try to figure out what I saw.  It was so bizarre. ,[Investigator (MM) notes  GPS coordinates  34.6119725  -94.2168322 In the power line route perpendicular to railroad track crossing Polk County Road 76W ,Polk,36,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5113,yes

207,It was late summer at my grandfather  s cattle farm. My grandfather owns XX  s of acres of property in Pope County  in the city of Russelville. He lives on a small corner of his property on about XX acres of land on which he grazes his cattle. One night when were sitting on the porch of his trailer home  we noticed that something was disturbing the cattle. The  Brem  Cattle that were usually calm and scattered by the barn on the far side of the property  came running to the fence as they usually did when threatened by a Coy dog. Without giving it a second thought we hopped in the truck  grabbed the night vision binoculars and the high beam and started around the perimeter of the grazing land. We saw nothing until we came down near the pond where the cattle were watered. At first  we missed it with the night vision goggles because it was so still. But when we ran the light through the trees  we caught the glare from its eyes looking right at us. It was too far up in the trees to be a deer or a coy dog and the eyes were too big to be an oppossum or coon. We trained the light on its eyes and as we scanned down the tree  we saw what looked like a very large man leaning very still against the tree. He was huge  around 8 feet tall with black hair and eyes. His hair covered every inch of his body except for his face which was slightly less hairy around the eyes and forhead. I saw him first because I was using the high beam to scan the tree line and brush for eyes. I was too afraid to say anything and by the time I finally found the words to say and pointed grandpa in the right direction  the creature had turned and walked away. The next day we went to look where the creature was standing  but we found no prints because of the shale that was used to form the levy for the pond. ,Withheld upon request ,Pope,5,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5115,yes
208,This week  my roommate  s parents  who live about 10 miles north of Russleville  went out of town for vacation. They left my roommate to house-sit  so we took the opportunity to play some video games on their giant 3d tv. While taking a smoke break outside  we all began to hear a moaning in the distance that was driving all of the local dogs crazy. Initially the calls were quite frequent  in groups of three or so  with maybe a minute or two of silence between each group of three. As the dogs would calm down  the howl became audible again. We couldn  t identify exactly what we were hearing  like a siren with a growl in the lower register; but we were too far out of town for this to be any kind of emergency vehicle  or boat horn. We couldn  t even decide that this was an animal any of us had heard before. As the night progressed  the howls became less frequent and farther away  though they maintained the repetitive grouping. My friends know me to be the bigfoot enthusiast of our group  but I wasn  t about to try to confirm what we were hearing as a sasquatch call without some point of reference. When I listened to the 1994 Moaning Howl recording  from Ohio  I asked my roommates if it sounded familiar  all agreed; so  I  m posting this today. ,From I40  go north on weir road  I  m foggy on directions but it  s about 15 minutes north of weir rd. ,Pope,5,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5115,no

210,My friends and I would work on our motorcycles  and then ride them in the woods at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock  AR. (back when they let us do such things ). The day started off normal  with my friends  Loren P.  Jerry W.  Tommy B.  Jim O.  and myself riding our motorcycles. There was a ditch about 6 feet deep  and 7 feet wide and we took turns jumping it. I was on a yellow Suzuki 185 motorcycle with a stinger exhaust system on it. I was jumping the ditch and almost crashed my motorcycle  and thought I had better quit before I got hurt. My friends all wanted to keep jumping the ditch  so I decided to ride East along a dirt trail that ran parallel to the ditch. I was in no hurry since I was not familiar with the trail  and was just enjoying the ride. I had ridden about 20 minutes or so when I saw what I thought was a white motorcycle going South. Since I was going East and it was going South I was afraid I would run into the other motorcycle  so I stopped to keep us from colliding into each other. I got glimpses of the white motorcycle as it was going though the trees  and was going to wave to the other rider as they either turned onto or crossed over the trail I was on. MUCH to my surprise the white motorcycle was not a motorcycle at all...  IT  was a very tall creature walking on it  s hind feet like a man  but with a stride that seemed to be about 6 feet per stride. The arms were lanky and long and swung slightly as it walked  and it  s hands hung down about knee level. The creature had long lanky legs  and they looked to be fairly muscular like it did a lot of walking and running. The feet were long  my guess they may have been 15 to 18 inches or so  but they seemed accurately proportioned for a creature of it  s height. The creature was about 8 or 9 feet tall  and stopped right in the middle of the trail  and then turned to face me. It was about 25 yards from me  and there were no trees or brush between us to block my view of the creature. It was very tall  and lanky and was a dirty white albino color. It did not have any clothing and seemed to be covered in short dirty white hairs. I could not see any indication of the creatures sex. It  s head was more of a triangular shape than round  and I  m certain it was not human. The eyes were close together  and were very focused on me...I would describe them as definately being predator  s eyes. The nostril holes were small  and seemed to be about 2 inches apart  and the mouth was similar to a humans but just a bit wider. I had a full motorcross helmet on  so if the creature had an odor  I could not smell it. The only sounds I heard were the beating of my heart about to explode out of my chest  and the popping of the 185 Suzuki  s stinger exhaust. The creature and I looked at each other for what seemed like an eternity  then it made a snarling expression and squinted it  s eyes at me. It  s mouth went from a closed frown to rising it  s upper lip and showing me what I considered it  s meat eating teeth...I GOT THE MESSAGE !!! Then it  s eyes squinted more at me  as if it was starting to get really pissed at me for being there. About the time I thought it was fixin to attack me  it turned and started walking South again. The creatures stride still amazed me  it  s single walking stride from one foot to the other was probably 4 times my stride. I  m certain that if it had tried to run up and catch me  I would not have been able to flee in time. I had a hair standing on the back of my neck suspicion that it might be about to make a fish-hook loop like an injured bear  and then suddenly pop up right beside me on the trail. I turned the 185 Suzuki around and rode like a professional to get the hell out there. I was too scared to look behind me  and was praying for Jesus to protect me as I also tried to make sure I didn  t crash! I felt that if I crashed the motorcycle  it would surely catch me if it was in pursuit. It had taken me about 20 minutes or so to get to where I saw the creature  it only took about 10 minutes to get back to where my friends and I had been jumping the ditch because I was riding skentback and scared to death. When I did get back to the truck  my friend Jim O. was sitting on the bed of the truck relaxing. The rest of our friends were not at the ditch  or the truck. I yelled at Jim O. with a half squeeky pitched voice  because in my heart was still in my throat   I said  Jim there  s something in the woods! We need to warn the rest of the guys!  Then came my next major surprise of the day  Jim asked me  Is it real tall and white?  I yelled  YES  why in the Hell didn  t you tell me about it?  Jim said  I didn  t tell anyone about it  because I didn  t want anyone thinking I  m crazy  or making fun of me!  Then Jim proceeded to tell me about the time him and his nephew Pete saw the creature while squirrel hunting at Camp Robinson. This occurred back in 1976 while I was a Senior in High School. I bow-hunt in Camp Robinson from time to time  and as God is my witness  the hairs still stand up on my neck when it  s dark and gets too quiet in the woods. There have been times that I feel like something was watching me  and I immediately remember the creature I saw by the All American Drop Zone. There are times where bow and arrow or not... I waited until it got light enough for me to see before I would get out of the truck. It doesn  t matter to me if you believe this story or not...I  ve been telling it to family  friends  co-workers  and even strangers since the day I actually saw the creature  and it saw me back in 1976. ,It was just North of the All-American Drop Zone inside Camp Robinson. ,Pulaski,15,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5119,yes
211,In October 2010 I was bow hunting on Camp Robinson military compound in North Little Rock  AR on Approximately 23 000 acres. I was hunting between two mountain ridges in the bottom of the valley approximately 100 yards from a thick creek bottom. I started the afternoon hunt at 2 30 pm finding my way to a new stand set up. I hunted all afternoon seeing alot of good deer sign in the area. After what started to be a promising day in the deer woods. I did not see a deer all day and the sun starting going down behind the mountain ridge to my west. It was getting so dark out that I could no longer see thru my peep sight. So  I decided to start packing up my backpack and start my decent down the tree. By now  it was well after dark and without my headlamp I could not see 3 foot in front of me. As I started to make my way down the tree. I heard the most disturbing sound in the woods that I have ever heard in my life. It was a very  very  loud  deep toned  gravely  blood curdling Growl/yell which seemed to be approximately 150/200 yards away from me to my southeast. It sounded as if someone was trying to yell for help. I immediately froze to the side of the tree and tried to gather my thoughts on what it could be. I originally thought that it was a person in the woods trying to play a prank on me. Mainly  because I had seen a pickup truck drive down the distant ridge several hours earlier. Then I realized that it was too loud to be a human screaming in the woods. I remained frozen to the side of the tree for several more minutes and tried to gather my thoughts of what could have made that sound. I am 43 years old and have been an avid hunter every year in some capacity since I was 6 years old and I have never heard anything like this in my life. After several minutes I finally made my way to the base of the tree  packed my stand  grabbed my bow and started to walk out on the trail that I walked in on into the direction of the  sound . I had about a 50 yard SE walk towards the  sound  then 100 yards west to an old logging road then 300 yards north back to where my truck was parked beside a small pond. So  as i left the tree walking SE and arrived at the west trail. I got a very uneasy feeling like something was watching me. So  I stopped to listen. Its was then I heard the  sound  again. It appeared to be moving closer to my location and approximately 50 yards away. Needless to say  I did not stick around to see what it was  for all I had was a headlight  bow in hand and a gut knife on my hip. So  I immediately start sprinting toward my truck. I have NEVER been so scared in my entire life. I started my truck and got the hell out of there. On my drive out of Camp Robinson. I called several of my closest friends and my dad and told them of the encounter. I stayed up all night on the internet to research this sound that I heard in the woods that night. I listened to mountain lions  african lions  tigers  bears  bobcats  foxes  coyotes  wild boars  etc... and I could not find anything that would come close to what I heard. The very next day. I drove back to the same area at Camp Robinson where I heard the  sound . Again right at dark from the comfort of my pickup truck with a pistol in my hand. I heard the sound again further down the valley approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away. I was a very distinct sound  very loud.... Since  these three occurrences. I have hunted at Camp Robinson on many more occasions and I have not heard this  sound  again. Still baffles me to this day of what I heard those two nights and I have still never heard anything like it. ,East of West Boundry Road between Clifton Mountain Rd and Demolition Road on Camp Robinson Military base. ,Pulaski,15,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5119,no
212,I saw an unidentified animal around 7 55 P.M. on 12/7/12 on the side of the road with gray fur I was driving at night on I-40 W from Little Rock to Conway around the 144 marker. It was on the right hand side of the road and was in a slumped/ sitting position. The animal was very large and had long gray/silver/black hair but mostly a dirty light gray. The best view of the animal I got was the broad side of its back.  The widest part of the body was at the elbows and it appeared to be about 4.5ft wide. From what appeared to be the head to the ground was about 5.5 ft tall. As I passed by I tried slowing down and was able to see  a profile shot of the animal. It appeared to be sitting looking at something on the ground. I would guess that it could be a deer that was hit by a car. I see deer at night on the sides of the road here almost every night coming through this area. The size of the animal was scaled to a road sign I saw just before the sighting. It was a large 4x4 sign that was turned backwards so all I could only see is the gray back. Minuets later after I saw the sign  the same distance from the road and slightly down the embankment was the anima (about 1.5-2 ft away from the white line).  The hair was similar to that of those long haired cows all over the body but still was able to see muscles under the hair very similar to a gorilla. After it happened I was not sure what I saw. I tried to classify the animal. To this day I have no ideas for sure what I saw. I have seen hundreds of animals at night driving and this was the first thing I could not ID. The animal had an eerie resemblance to a Bigfoot. At the time I had never heard of a Bigfoot with light colored hair and until I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where an eye whitness saw a white colored Bigfoot. I am open to any possibilities of the ID of this animal. Please let me know the BFRO  s thoughts. Thanks! ,I-40 between Little Rock and Conway around marker 144 heading west. ,Pulaski,15,Arkansas ,AR,Winter ,5119,yes
213,I was driving south on Batesville-Pike Rd on my way to work.  There are woods on both sides of this road with a tall chain link fence surrounding the woods on both sides.  The right hand side of the road is part of Camp Robinson.  Just past the fence there is a fire break before the tree line begins.  I had just driven around a sharp curve and due to the curve I was driving pretty slow.  There are lots of deer in this area and I am typically looking to see if any are close by.  There is a small creek bed in the curve with a large culvert running under the road connecting both sides of the street in that area.  Just past the curve I saw a tall  upright  black figure.  It was about 10 yards past the beginning of the treeline.  This creature was walking at an angle through the woods towards the creek.  I saw his right profile and the back of him. It appeared to have arms which were hanging at his side. There are lots of trees in this area so parts of his profile were blocked at times.  All of the leaves are off the trees at this so I had a pretty clear view.  He appeared to be 6-7 feet tall with black hair.  I  m not exactly sure what I saw but I know that it wasn  t a deer.  This road has a pretty high amount of traffic in the morning and is highly guarded by Camp Robinson. ,Bateville-Pike begins just past the North Little Rock airport (Remount Rd).  The sighting occurred just before the 1st major curve if you are traveling south on Bateville-Pike.  I saw the creature on the Camp Robinson side of the road.

214,We started hunting this 80 acres around 2003. I was  sitting in my Deer stand when some dogs came barking through the woods like they were chasing something.  They went up into this corner where the woods and the fenceline meet and started rolling around in the dirt and barking so I got down to run the dogs off and to see what they was rolling on and when I got to the corner I could smell something that smelled like dead animal  musky and sour.  Then as I turned something across the powerline in the woods approximately 50 yards away let out this deep long growl.   I have never heard anything like this in my life so I started backing away and when I got to the path I ran to our truck. After we got home my husband and I looked up growl sounds and I never could find anything that sounded like this it was horrifying to me! I also had another incident with my husband back in  about 2003 we was going out there to this property and feeding the deer. We was on our four wheeler and we drove to the powerline and the man who owned the property had been there and bush hogged  and had moved some tin that was laying there and the grass  was dead where  the tin had been lying. Right in the middle was a cell phone so my husband picked it up and It have been chewed on by dogs are coyotes or something so he laid it up on the tin  which was about 4 feet away.  So we filled our deer feeders and left. We come back the next day job to the powerline and the cell phone was back in the dead grass area exactly where we had first found it.  So my husband picked it up put it back on the tin.  So we check the feeders and left. We come back the next day drove back to the powerline and the cell phone was gone and they  re in the dead grass area laid a piece of pipe  about 2 foot long so we picked up the pipe and put it on the tin  and we left. We didn  t get to come back the next day but the following day we came back drove to the powerline and the pole was gone but there in the dead grass laid a little white button. It  was the kind of button you see on mobile home ceilings.  By this time we was freaking out. So we put the button on the tin  and I laid in the dead grass area a ponytail holder I had and also I mint.  Nothing took the ponytail holder or mint.  My husband found the cell phone again approximately 75 yards up  the Powerline about a month later but we never seen the pipe or the button again ,Private property.

215,A couple of my uncles were out hunting near the Saline river when whey decided to get a drink from the River (back when it was clean enough to drink from!) They dropped their guns and backs and knealt down at the River  s edge. As they were drinking  they heard noises coming from across the River....brush rattling  sticks breaking  etc. They got their guns and prepared to get a deer and were surprised when a large  brown figure came trotting out of the brush and headed downshore a bit before crossing over to their side of the River. At first they thought it was a bear  but then saw that it was running on two legs like an ape or man. Realizing it had crossed over to their sides  they decided it was smart to cross over to the other side and head back upstream to their trucks. They kept on their toes until they got back to the road  but didn  t hear or see anything strange the rest of the day. ,I  m not sure the first try went through so I thought I  d send my story again.

216,I previously sent you an e-mail of this experience  but it occurred in the fall of 1994. We had just moved into our home here and the deer were always coming up to our back fence and causing these little wimp dogs of mine to go into cardiac arrest  esp. at night when I was trying to go to sleep. So I was in the habit of taking a small rifle and shooting a round into the trees to frighen the deer away and shut the dogs up. One night I decided to take my single shot  break-over 410 into the woods on trail to really scare them away. So carrying a flashlight  the gun (broke open   1 round loaded) and two more rounds  I went off into the woods. About 30 yds into them  I heard movement to my right at about one o  clock  shining my light at the brush  I saw the thing standing stock still. I could tell it was about 7ft. and it was half again as broad across the shoulders as me. I  m 6  1     and 300lbs so I  m not a little fella by any means  but I was next to this thing. It had a brownish- orange long fur over what I could see of it s body and it  s face was dark. My light reflected in it  s eyes like an animal.  At that time it grunted and made to move towards me. Being a redneck  the first thing I did was to close the gun  aim and fire. I know I didn  t miss because he was only about 30 to 35ft away and I saw fur fly. It yelled and began to move towards again and began to walk backwards  reloading the gun and never taking the light off of it. I fired again  not missing and he really started move on me   so I did this one more time  this time firing one handed. I turned and ran from the woods to my house. My wife was on the back porch when I came out of the woods and I yelled for her to get my 8mm rifle. She met me with it  I spun around  fully expectng to see this thing on me. It wasn  t there. I could here it running through the woods  which isn  t easy with all of the under growth here. It let out a long loud  warbeling  yell that reminded me of sounds yo might hear at the primate house at the zoo. ,Wooded hilltop near cell towers ,Saline,12,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5125,yes
217,My friend and I were in the woods near my house hiking when my friend fell and hurt his ancle. I wanted to see something ahead of us real quick before heding back to my house so he sits down while i go ahead. I walk about 50 feet  not quite out of sight of my friend when this HUGE  tall hairy creature was kneeling. I turned to run and it chased me! I caught up with my friend. I didnt have to tell him what i saw. He saw it and ran with me. We got out of the woods and turned around and it was gone. No noises or nothing. We didnt bother to tell anyone. We were both white because my mom asked what was wrong but we said nothing and went on about our business. We never forgot it though. , ,Saline,12,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5125,yes
218,I was on my way to work just before day light  it was starting to get light  when I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye across an over grown farm field. I hit my brakes to get a better look thinking it might be a deer. What I saw was about 7 feet tall weighing about 300 to 350lbs running on two legs fast. It was not light enough to get a better look. I came to a stop to watch it run into the woods  I was about 75 feet from where it disappeared.  I tried to see where it was going to come out at but never got a second look. , ,Saline,12,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5125,yes
219,Sitting in tree during deer season. Saw a dark figure in deep brush  as i watch it moved into an open spot. I didn  t Know what it was so i looked through the scope of my gun  not having binoculars on me  and saw it standing next to a cedar tree  with its hand on the tree. It turned profile to me and noticed that it wasn  t any person in a custom as i thought it was at first. it was about 7  5  tall deep brown color  had hair from nose down  the face was deep wrinkled and the eyes had no whites  they were colored kind of. Scared i clicked the safety of my gun off  and the creature let out a deep grunt  way too deep to be any bear. It ran into the thick brush. A little while later i walked down to where it was to see if i could figure out what it was. I saw an imprint in the bark like a thumb and two long scratches that were as far apart as my pointer and pinkie streched. ,Winona wildlife area ,Saline,12,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5125,yes
220,We had set up camp just before dusk and were sitting around the campfire. We tried wood knocks and call blasting. We did hear a wood knock in response to one of ours. Throughout the night we heard coyotes and owls but also 3 howls we could not identify  and 2 more wood knocks. We also heard at 2 different times in different areas close to camp what sounded like heavy sighs. At about 11pm I got up from the fire to go and relieve myself. I walked to the other side of my truck  about 25 ft from the fire and as I stood there I had a very strange feeling and then a rock came flying thru the air and landed about 10 feet from me. The next morning as we were looking around the camp we found 6 foot prints. 3 were good enough to cast and we did. We believe they are from a juvenile and were there from a day or two before and we just didn  t see them while setting up camp the night before. This was in Saline County on land owned by a logging company. ,back roads on logging land ,Saline,12,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5125,no
221,On Monday June 7th at around 3 00 I went horseback riding at a friends house. Shortly after I got out of the driveway and onto the dirt road the horse spooked and jumped sideways. I heard 2 HEAVY footsteps in the woods quite close to the road. You could hear small trees and branches beeing trampled. I saw a large white hairy figure moving quickly through the brush. It was hard to make out the complete figure. It was tall and big as far as I could see. Then as suddenly as it had happend the sounds were gone and I could no longer see anything. I have a few friends that are going to go up there with me next week to see if there are any signs of anything left at that spot. ,(Removed per witness) ,Searcy,2,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5129,yes
222,I was visiting some friends in Huntington Arkansas in the summer of 1988. We all decided to go to a local lake for some bass fishing. They had warned me that there were tons of water moccasins and to be VERY careful where I stepped. I was moving along the bank fishing and I was paying a whole bunch of attention to where I was placing my feet when all of a sudden there was a commotion in the woods about fifteen feet to the right of me. When I turned and looked I could see a very large creature  about 7 to 8 feet tall with very broad shoulders  and could hear a sort of  whoooop whoooop  noise. Thinking it was one of my companions trying to scare me I moved toward it. At that time it grabbed the tree trunk next to it and just twisted it off  and kind of slapped the ground with it  and made a very low guttural growl. At that point I was more scared than I have ever been in my life. It was really intimidating because its muscles were flexed  and its head was tilted down and it was staring right at me. My Dad had taught me about encounters with bears and what to do. My instinct was to run  but my Dad always taught me that an animal will chase you if you run. I just dropped my pole and looked down at the ground and slowly backed away. The animal followed me a short way and just turned and walked into the woods. When I got back to where my friends were I told them happened and they just laughed at  and made fun of me. I have never been back to that part of the country and now live in the desert where there are few trees. , ,Sebastian,2,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5131,yes
223,I live in rural part of Sevier County  Arkansas.  On 2/6/11 I went out to feed my dogs. They are tied out about 150 yards from my house. As I was feeding the dogs I noticed a large barefoot track measuring about 13.25 inches long and 5.5 inches at the widest part  and 4 inches at the instep.  I saw only one right footprint as the snow was melting quickly. I found another track west of the house about 300 yards from the first one. It was more melted so the toes were not as clear. Track was also right foot. I called my two grandsons to take the pictures with their camera and cell phones. ,Tracks were heading Southwest. ,Sevier,10,Arkansas ,AR,Winter ,5133,no
224,Third hand story.  Ten or so years ago  a lot of oil was being trucked from this remote area which is close to the Felsenthal Wildlife Refuge.  This required night loading on the outskirts of this cyprus swamp.  As the story goes  one truck driver was sitting in the truck and was overcome with a strong  gamey smell.  He turned on his head lights to see a large  ape like creature staring at him. It had red eyes and was of enormous size.  The man panicked and drove off with the loading hose still attached spilling oil everywhere.  The oil company owners were convinced that he had seen something by the circumstantial evidence.  The man refused to ever do a night load again.  A second individual was night loading at a later time.  He was naturally somewhat spooked due to the earlier event.  One night he smelled the  odor  and panicked as well doing considerable damage leaving the area.  He saw nothing but was sure the smell was the creature.  As to my knowledge  there has been no investigation of this area.  It  s quite a spooky place. ,Union County  Near Strong  AR ,Union,14,Arkansas ,AR,Unknown ,5139,yes
225,In early November 2002  I decided to get in an afternoon of squirrel hunting before deer season opened and the woods got full of hunters.  I drove to an oil well location that is located south of town off the main highway and parked my truck there. I left the location and walked down an old road and headed east into the woods to hunt along the ridge and wooded area that joins the swamp.  I  d walk the road and then leave it and wade through the bushes looking for squirrels then head back to the road and follow it for a ways and then leave the road again.  I  d been hunting for a good while and had gotten to an area where the briars and bushes had taken over the old road.  I decided to turn around and hunt back toward the truck since it was getting late  and I hadn  t seen but one squirrel and that was soon after I got into the woods. Just as I started to head back  I got a whiff of the most foul odor that I have ever smelled.  It actually made me gag  because I have a very weak stomach.  I figured it was a dead animal or a wild hog  but I  d never smelled any hog that stunk that bad. I knew I couldn  t stay there with that smell  so I turned to head back down the road.  As I did  I heard something make a couple of growling type sounds in a clump of bushes off to my left  and saw the bushes just shaking like hell.  I still figured it was a hog  but I  d never heard one that sounded like that and figured if it was a hog it would grunt instead of growl.  I was getting nervous about meeting up with a big boar  or maybe even a big cat  so I took off at a fast pace back up the road.  After I  d gone a ways  I heard what sounded like three squealing hoot type sounds  still to the left of the road.  I was very spooked by then thinking that can  t be a hog  and picked up my pace even more.  After a ways  I stopped to listen and when I did  I heard something out to my left take a couple of steps and stop. It sounded like someone walking out in the bushes  and it didn  t sound like it was too far away from the road and I could swear I heard heavy breathing.  I headed for the truck again wanting to break into the clearing before it got completely dark.  Just as I got within sight of the well location  I heard the walking sound again and looked behind me thinking I  d see a person following me on the road.  What I saw was a tall reddish looking creature cross the road behind me about 20 yards.  It was moving in a hurry and I only saw it for a second or two.  It stepped completely across the road in one step  then it sounded like it was running away from the road through the bushes.  I took off for the truck at a full run and when I reached the truck  I jumped in and got out of there in a hurry.  I don  t know what it was that I saw  but I  m sure that it was at least a foot taller than my 5  8  and it looked massive  like a giant hairy man with long arms and long hair all over it  s body  and the fastest moving thing I  ve ever seen or heard. I  ve been back to the area since then with my nephew  but the timber has been cut in that area and it  s no good for hunting anymore.  I didn  t smell  see or hear anything when we went back to  those woods. ,South of El Dorado  AR on Hwy 167 there is an oil well location about 300 yards off the highway to the east.

226,My friend and I were on a vacant road (Victory Dumas)directly off of Calion Road in El Dorado  AR.  We were sitting on the tailgate of my truck just hanging out.  I got up to go get my cell phone from the passenger  s seat and was about to open the door when I glanced up.  I saw a creature  about 15 yards away  standing upright about 4 to 5 feet tall on the left side of the road.  With great speed  it ran across the narrow road  and paused when it got to the other side without looking at me.  It took off into the woods.  When it did so  my friend jumped off of my tailgate  not seeing (only hearing it) and asked  What was that?   I said  I have no idea  and then I told her to get in the truck.  When we got in  I told her that I saw  something that didn  t appear to be human but was running upright.   It appeared to be dark brown or black in color and looked to be covered in hair.  It was hunched over  yet very quick.  I can honestly say I have never seen anything like that.  We sat in the truck for 5 minutes out of fear.  I gassed it and left the road quickly.   Do you think this may be a young sasquatch?  After all it was only 4-5 ft. tall. ,A quarter mile before reaching 167 North  on Calion Road  turn right onto Victory Dumas and drive 500 yds to the dead end. ,Union,14,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5139,yes
227,I am writing this because i think that i might have had a recent  experience with a bigfoot. I live in Springdale  Ar. Springdale is not very rugged as far as forest goes  but it can get pretty secluded in the right places. On october 10 2002 me and a friend set out on a trip to follow a creek to see how far it goes  because i followed this creek when i was young. This creek goes through springdale  and winds in through Elm springs wheres theres nothing but dense trees on one side the left  and open fields  to the right-private properity. Well Elm springs is not a big city  and you would never know the surrundings where i was not unless you owend the properity.It was about 5 00 pm when i decided that it was time to try to get out of the creek and up on the bank we had been walking about 2 hours in and out of the creek and i decided that we could cover more ground on land before the sun went down. Now im about 5 9 and i guess the creek bed must have been 7 foot high so i had my friend C hoist my foot up while i got my knee up high enough to pull myself up.Now the original plan was to yank him up once on top but looking back on it now i realize how foolish this was because i would had to be extremely strong because i probably could have just have barely have had touched his fingertips from way up there but it didnt matter because what i saw when i got on my feet scared the crap out of me. The best way to explain it is just to tell you that my heart sunk and I was just extremely stunned. When i got to my feet i was facing nothing but dense forests or woods somthing caught the corner of my eye about lets say 75 to 100 yards off. Just before getting a good enough look at it i could tell it was big and brown now ive never seen a bear before out in the wild  so imediately i started to panic. I took one quick look down and figured i would break every bone in my legs if i were to jump for the water was only maybe a foot deep  with all this happening in what i would say just about 2 seconds and keep in mind i havent even been able to warn my friend yet of what i thought to be a charging bear  i look back to see this thing or whatever it was walking extremely fast! It was then i noticed that this couldnt have been a bear. I got a clear look at it for just a second.Ill never forget what i saw that day.I remember its head  real long head i guess you could say it was shaped like an egg  i just know it wasnt like a humans  the eyes must have been dark because i couldnt make them out i didnt reall notice a nose ether  but there was so much hair  it was hard to make anything out except for the head.The biggest thing ill never forget is the height and weight of this thing.It was so big legs coverd with hair  so massive that had to have been the biggest part of this thing so wide had to have been as wide as a refrigerator.In comparing the legs to my legs i would have to say each leg made two sets of both of my legs.The shouldars were massive could have been three feet or over from shoulder to shoulder.I also remember how it walked  besides taking extremely wide steps  it kind of walked with its front body slightly hunched over i dont know  like some one with bad posture.The height of this thing was astronomical.The tip of its head was in the tree tops!!! now dont get me wrong  the trees werent that tall  but they were at least 8 to 9 feet where the limbs started to curl out and i remember the head was up there with them  there is no way i could have jumped and touched the limbs  they were just to high up.So i would put whatever it was that i seen to be 8 to 9 foot tall. And looking back on it now  the frame could have easily held 500- 600 pounds the arms on it looked long  and they swayed back in forth heavily i do not recall a odor or anything like that for this thing was out of my view in about id say 5 to 7 seconds. Now i realize when i was getting up the creek bed  i had spooked the thing because it sure didnt waste no time getting gone into the woods.And i was not about to follow it.So with all this said i asked my friend if he had heard anything which he said no because of the running water and i guess because he was down there and i said man i just seen a monster go into the woods! ofcourse my facial feachure was very solemn and serious but he still didnt believe me.I repeated this several times to him and i guess he could tell by looking at my face i was serious.He later said my face looked white. With his help i got down back into the creek but it did take a few minutes and even then i wound up falling back down in the creek luckly i wasnt hurt just wet and scared the sun was setting and we jogged and trampled our way back never once daring to go back up on land. We talked and thought better of muterring such foolishness around for fear of people thinking were nuts. Truthfuly i dont even think he beleives me.But putting myself in his shoes i probably wouldnt either.But it doesnt matter  i know what i saw  so in closing i have ruled out the possbility of a hoax 1. why would somebody be out in the middle of nowhere in this kind of costume? 2. how would they know we were coming?3.how do you account for the height and size  it was easily a foot taller than any human ive ever seen.It was so tall you cant duplicate that kind of height.Ihope someone reads this and takes it seriously because i dont know if ill ever go into the woods again. ,Im not familiar with location me and my friend followed Spring creek from Springdale into Elm Springs where there is only dense woods id say about five miles into Elm Springs out of the creek bed to the left about fifty yards off. ,Washington,54,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,1129,no
228,Hi BFRO my sighting happen nine months ago near Searcy Arkansas I was hunting on Thanksgiving day. It was getting dark when I had a rock thrown over my head which freaked me out so I quickly turned around and lifted my shotgun and light and look up and down the tree line until I came up on a big oak and I saw what looked like a Sasquatch looking at me from behind the oak and it yelled at me with a low grunt and high pitch scream so I jumped and actually took a shot and hit the tree and it took off running back down the line towards a valley. ,A public hunting grounds. ,White,16,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5145,yes
229,Around 5pm I was driving down hwy 258 to go to the store. We have had some recent flooding so I was driving slower than normal and watching for deer. Along the way I seen 2 different area of deer  one had 3 I could see the other there was at least 6. So on the way back from the store I knew to slow down in those areas just in case. In one area it is a rather sharp curve and I had seen the most deer there. As I came up on the curve I slowed down and suddenly something jumped out in front of the car!!! I  ll call it a  he from here out.   He seem to have been running from the pine tree line and took a  what I would call a leap  out onto the road then he was gone. It was only 1 maybe two steps on the road it  s self to clear it! I had slammed on the brakes and just sit there in awe wondering if I really seen what I had.  He was standing on two legs  lots of fur and what I would assume Is at least 8 foot tall. When he jumped in front of the car he was about a car length in front of me. He looked to have had a large fish in his hand. I know how that sounds but I swear it was a long fish. My husband said it may have been a stick but I  m a country girl and I know my fish! His  fur  was longer than what bear fur would be and although he was dark brown it had a reddish hue to it  the headlights gave s good look at the color as it leaped across.  There is a lake back behind where he was running from but he also jumped across to the right where those 6 plus deer were standing. We are going back at first light to see if he left foot prints. It  s so muddy I  m hoping to see some.  We hear sounds out here almost nightly of what we describe as big foot sounds but I  ve honestly never thought they was out here. It is just sounds you can  t describe  so we call it bigfoot sounds. I  ve had several friends and family hear them and one of them will not stay outside long out here because she  s heard it so much. When I got home my husband came to the door to help bring stuff in and ask what was wrong  I said the deer are out bad and he asked if I hit one  I said no and he asked why was I shaking. I didn  t realize my whole body was still shaking! LoL  I started telling him and I had tears rolling down  heart pounding and still shaking so bad. It really shook me up so much.  Not sure what else to say. It was one of the most amazing yet scariest things I  ve ever seen. I know I will not sleep tonight due to thinking about it and what exactly happened. ,Going north on 67/167 take the second Bald Knob exit  turn left and go under over pass  then turn left onto Hwy 258  about two miles down in the curve. ,White,16,Arkansas ,AR,Winter ,5145,yes
230,Probable Sasquatch Vocalizations I am writing this in October 2009  three and one half years after hearing what were likely the vocalizations of two Sasquatches in southern Marion County  Arkansas in April 2006 in the Lower Buffalo Wilderness Area.  I have told many people unashamedly of my encounter over the past 3.5 years  and I have thought about it hundreds of times to keep the memory fresh in my mind. The date of my encounter was either Wednesday morning  April 19 or Thursday morning  April 20  2006.  The reason I am not certain of the date is that I do not keep a daily journal  and I cannot remember if I left home for my 3-day  2-night turkey hunt on Monday or Tuesday.  Whatever the case  the encounter happened on the final morning of my hunt. At midday on Monday or Tuesday  I launched my canoe at the Rush  Arkansas landing on the Buffalo River.  Rush is between the towns of Yellville and Harriet in the heart of the Ozark Mountains.  Before getting to the river  I had my last association with another human until two-plus days later.  I had purposefully planned my trip for mid-week while school was still in session  most adults were at work  the summer canoeists had not begun their season  and probably few other turkey hunters would be out hunting.  Indeed I did not see nor hear another person on my trip. I floated only about one mile downstream from Rush to the spot where Silver Hollow empties into the Buffalo River.  I pulled off on river right (the south side of the river)  and pitched my tent camp to be used for the next two nights.  I turkey hunted in Silver Hollow that afternoon and all the second day.  This entire region is mature deciduous woodland with a sprinkling of pines and cedars on certain slopes and bluffs.  Spring was just springing.  The dogwoods were blooming  and all the deciduous trees had just begun to leaf out. Silver Hollow is nearly pristine.  I saw no sign of humans having been in that 1.5-mile long hollow in many years.  There are a few signs of very old activity from 70+ years ago when some mining took place  but otherwise it was just me  the turkeys  and numerous species of neotropical songbirds (warblers  vireos  tanagers  and others) that had returned for the summer. I had heard several gobblers over the course of my 1.5 days hunting  but I had been unsuccessful in taking one.  As the second day came to a close  I returned to my camp and made a plan for the final morningâ€™s hunt.  I was to awake at 4 15 a.m.  eat my Cheerios breakfast  and then hike by flashlight 1.5 miles up Silver Hollow to set up where Iâ€™d heard a gobbler late the second evening. My watch-alarm awoke me at 4 15 a.m. on the final morning.  I lit the dim lantern at my campsite  and sat down to eat my Cheerios.  The last quarter moon was overhead shedding a small amount of light onto the otherwise very dark landscape.  It was chilly (probably mid-40â€™s degrees F)  and there was no wind.  There was not a sound to be heard â€“ no crickets  no Whippoorwills  nothing  owing to the cool  crisp  calm morning.  While eating  I was sitting facing northward into the darkness across the Buffalo River. As I was eating  the silence was broken by a loud  clear â€œhoooOOO-opâ€ call from the mountainside behind my left shoulder to the southwest of me.  I immediately stopped in mid-crunch to soak in the brief  1.5-second call I was hearing.  Within two seconds and before I had resumed crunching  an even louder  clear â€œhoooOOO-opâ€ call came from the mountainside on the north side of the river.  This call was to the northwest of me.  The second call was not an echo of the first call.  It was a second animal responding to the first.  There were no 90-degree cliff faces in the area to have created an echo.  Besides  the second call was louder than the first  with no hint of echo after either call. So  I was sitting there thinking with a mouth full of Cheerios  â€œWhat on earth could have made those calls?â€  I am a lifelong birder.  I have seen all but two of the approximately 650 regularly-occurring North American bird species.  Furthermore  I can identify more than 600 of those species by song or call note alone.  I immediately ruled out all birds as having made the sounds  even the Barred Owl which has quite a repertoire.  My mind turned to the mammals â€“ coyote  fox  bobcat  otter  etc.  I quickly ruled out all of those.  Mountain lion maybe?  I have never seen or knowingly heard a mountain lion in the wild.  However  once I returned home from this trip  I listened to every mountain lion vocalization I could find on the Internet  and I ruled out the mountain lion. But still  as I continued eating my bowl of Cheerios  I kept thinking  â€œThe sounds I just heard were distinctly human/primate in quality.â€  At that point in my life (I was 43 years old)  I had done enough self-study to be a believer in the existence of Sasquatch.  But I didnâ€™t think too much about Sasquatch in my everyday life.  I certainly started thinking about Sasquatch as I was finishing my cereal that morning!  I am not frightened by knowing Sasquatch is out there  but I have a scientific curiosity about the animal. Soon  during my hour-long hike by flashlight up Silver Hollow  I kept replaying what Iâ€™d heard over and over in my mind.  About 1/3 of the way up the hollow  I shined my flashlight into the cave opening that Iâ€™d hiked past several times in the past two days.  I thought  â€œYou know  there is no sign of man at this cave entrance â€“ no trash  no footprints  no graffiti.  There are hundreds  maybe thousands  of caves like this in these hollows  and many thousands of caves throughout the whole Ozark Mountain region.  Sasquatches live here.  They have protection from the elements.  Theyâ€™re largely nocturnal.  They avoid man.  The vast majority of canoeists who pour down the Buffalo River in the summer donâ€™t leave the riverside  so the canoeists are no bother to the Sasquatch.  Those few canoeists who spend the night in a tent on the riverside may be unknowingly sleeping within 100 yards of Sasquatches.  Sasquatch doesnâ€™t bother the people  and the people never know the animal is near. I hunted that morning  did not bag a turkey  and I broke camp about noon.  I paddled back upriver one mile to my car  loaded up  and drove 2 hours home to central Arkansas. I believe the first call I had heard at 4 30 a.m. on that dark  calm  chilly morning in the Lower Buffalo Wilderness Area was a Sasquatch announcing  â€œIâ€™m right here.â€  Within two seconds  the Sasquatch on the north side of the river responded with  â€œIâ€™m over here across the river.â€  Perhaps it was their way of saying that daylight is coming in another hour or so  and maybe itâ€™s about time to call it a night. I estimate that each Sasquatch was roughly 1/4 to 1/3 mile from me at the time of the vocalizations.  The three of us formed more-or-less of an equilateral triangle. Why do I think that the sounds did not come from humans? First  I donâ€™t think there were any humans within earshot of me during my trip â€“ not even another turkey hunter.  I had not heard even a gunshot during the whole trip  and 2006 was the final year of a good turkey population in Arkansas. Second  humans have much more sophisticated ways of communicating with each other than yelling â€œhoooOOO-opâ€ at 4 30 a.m. from one mountainside to another across the Buffalo River in a designated Wilderness Area during mid-week in mid-April (!). Third  gorillas and chimpanzees are known to make sounds like I am describing. And fourth  for those of you convinced that Sasquatch exists  you know that Sasquatch is known to make such vocalizations. I am a scientist.  I have a Chemical Engineering degree  and I have been actively practicing the profession for 24 years in the plastics and chemical industries.  For those readers of this story who approach nearly every aspect of your life with a strong scientific bent like I do  you already know that Sasquatch exists.  You have seen the Patterson/Gimlin film from the late 1960â€™s near the California/Oregon border  and you know it could not have been a hoax.  The animal videoed was a real  in-the-flesh adult female Sasquatch.  You have further educated yourself with the stories from thousands of people over the decades and centuries who have described seeing a creature with a remarkably consistent set of features â€“ large  tall  hairy  muscular  wide shoulders  no neck  cone head  long arms  big feet  smelly.  Your knowledge of the fundamentals (or the entire science) of statistics tells you plainly that the probability that all of these thousands of people are wrong is essentially nil. And then you think more about the multitude of reports.  One person is not reporting seeing a white elephant here  another a purple tiger there  and yet another a green velociraptor somewhere else. They are all seeing a Sasquatch â€“ a large  tall  hairy  muscular  â€¦ creature. ,Rush is between the towns of Yellville and Harriet.  The vocalizations were heard about 1 mile down the Buffalo River from Rush  at the junction of Silver Hollow and the Buffalo River. ,Marion,40,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,1093,no
231,My brother Mark and I were riding in the back of my Dad  s green   69 Ford pickup in the early summer of 1970 just outside of Georgetown  Arkansas.  My Dad was driving  my grandpa was in the passenger  s seat  and my brother Larry was sitting between them.  Mark was 9 1/2 at the time and I had just turned 11.  As we made the right turn on the new highway from Georgtown to Draketown  I saw something 30 to 40 yards up the hill from the road.  At first  it was so tall that I thought it was the stump of a tree that had been struck by lighting  but as we passed it accelerating up the hill  it began to move.  In three steps  it was to the ditch at the side of the road  and then it took one long step across the ditch into the middle of the two lane highway.  It turned its whole body to look at us going up the hill.  Mark remembers a grayish splotch of fur on the chest  but otherwise  the fur was dark brown in color  longish but not dangling  and it had red eyes. We recently discussed this incident with my dad in Springdale  AR  and he remembered Elmer Drake in the   40  s telling people around that area that he had seen what he thought was a  gorilla  that had escaped from a zoo or a circus.  Well  all I can say is that it wasn  t a gorilla! ,Turn right off Hwy 74 at Draketown  AR  and go about 3-4 miles to Georgetown.

234,Back in 1969 when I was twelve years old my mother and oldest brother saw a creature while we were camping that changed our whole outlook concerning Bigfoot. This is our story   It was friday afternoon and my family was all excited about going on a weekend camping trip. My dad got off work a little early and we my mother five brothers and my sister had the truck packed so there was no delay in leaving when dad got home. AS we were heading down our street My great Aunt stepped out to the curb in front of her house and waved us down. She found out where we were going from my mother earlier that day Instead of telling us to have a good time she warned us not to go. She said a few weeks earlier she and my uncle had gone to the same place we were going and were fishing on the river when suddenly she saw a hairy face peering at her threw the bushes as she fished. It scared her and she began calling for my uncle It must have scared the creature because it ran away very fast.When she told my uncle what she saw He just called her a crazy old woman.But took her home anyway. Well upon hearing what she just said my dad laugh and told her we would keep an eye out for her booger. We arrived on the river in plenty of time to set-up the camp and have supper before it got dark. Soon it was dark and my brothers were across the road from the camp about 50 yards away fishing for catfish they were my three older brothers. The rest of us sat around the camp fire planing the next days activities. my dad was listening to the radio and my mother sister and two younger brothers was going to bed in our tent the family dog was with us and acting kind of strange all evening. I was not ready for bed yet so i took a little walk down the dirt road about 100 yards or so from the camp. the moon was out but with all the heavy trees near both sides of the road it was to dark to see more than twenty feet infront of me  when suddenly my hair stood up all over me I turned around fast and ran back to the camp. Thinking my aunt might be right about what she saw I decited to go to bed laying there for a while before falling to sleep. The next morning I got up from bed feeling great and along with my family we had a wonderful day fishing swimming and just enjoying the great out-doors. Soon it was saturday night and my brothers was back fishing for them catfish across from the camp. My dad was listening to country music on the radio and my mother and the rest of family was heading to bed.I was very tired from the activities of the day and decited to go to bed as well it was around 9 00 pm. A half hour had pasted and the dog was acting scared about something and to my suprise he unzipped the bottom section of the tent and climbed in with us. So we let him stay in the tent to settle him down my mother went out side the tent behind the truck to take a leek suddenly she began screeming I jumped up to look out the window to see my mother running to my dad around the truck saying it was watching me over and over agan. AS we all ran to my parents my brothers fishing on the river also came running. My dad told everyone to start packing up  we are breaking camp. My oldest brother stood guard with a pump-shotgun while we made record time loading the truck then my brother started shooting at something and yelling the dam thing is circling the camp. As we all were loading into the truck my dad and older brothers found strange footprints near the truck where my mother saw the creature standing. The footprints was 14 inches long and 8 inches wide and had onley three toes on each foot. WE were all so scared and went home right then. The next morning my aunt came up to our house to check on us   when she saw our still scared faces she knew we also had a run in with that creature. she and my mother got together and along with my brother they compared what each other had seen  it was white in color red glowing eyes and had a pointed head. about 6 to 7 feet tall and had long arms. needless to say we are a little picky about were we go camping anymore. ,Take hwy 71 to hwy 32 go west to Aleen cross over railroad tracks keep on 32 for 3 to 5 miles find the road to the right that leads to the river. the place is called cottonwood shouls. ,Little River,2,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5081,yes
235,The year was 1964  this was in Lee County Arkansas   we lived on 164 acre farm at the time .I was 11 years old  I was playing outside in the front yard about 2 in the afternoon  I looked up and seen something walking up the road  It was very tall and had long wavy hair  and it was going from side too side looking in the ditches as if it was searching for something  I screamed for my mom too come and look  She and my older sister came out  They jumped in the car too drive and get a closer look  but it ran into the woods. at that time there was several more sightings in the area.

236,My sighting happened in the Summer of 1986. At the time I was 12 yrs old at the time. I was at my Grandmother  s house outside of Bradford  AR.(about 50 miles NE of Little Rock) My Grandparents owned a large farm where the White Co. line and the Jackson Co lines met. It was around 9-930am. I had slept in the guest room that night. When I woke up I had the feeling as if someone was watching me. Their was a window next to the bed and as I looked to see if some one was there I noticed a Bigfoot staring at me through the top pane of the window. I am 6  5  tall and I can only see through the bottom of the window  that may give you an idea of his/her height. He/she was a reddish-brown color. I just looked and stared for probably 30-45 seconds. I never felt threatened or scared at any time. After this time had passed I wanted to see more  so I tried to step out of the bed really soft and when I did the rug that was on the hardwood floor slipped and I lost my footing. As I was down on my knee the Bigfoot stared at me. I was very puzzled. I was at a point where I just had to see what was going on. I then turned and tried to run to the back of the house where I could see him/her. When I got to the back door I seen it running through a field and toward an old barn. It had a very distinctive running style it  s hands were straight down and flat. I tried to get my Grandmother and Moms attention but they didn  t get there in time. He/she had a very slim  muscular build. ,Removed per witness request ,Jackson,47,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,1071,yes

239,April-May 1978 Hope  Arkansas.  Hempstead county Sighting was at a farm house (no longer there) on hwy 73 between hwy 278 and hwy 195. My family lived on a farm with all of your typical farm animals  and we all worked on the farm. There wasn  t much sitting and watching TV. The house was your typical little farm house that set back off the hwy about 50ft and behind it was a huge pasture with cows and horses. To the left of the house there was a small thicket that had a pond in the middle of it. Which is cleared out now. Directly behind the house another small patch of trees and brush on the pasture side of the barbed wire fence. The back yard was butted up to the fenced pasture where my horse Diamond would avoid and would always go the other side of the house to visit me. Back yard was big and full fresh cut grass. I didn  t like playing in the back or on the side that had the thicket and the pond  but this day my mom had bought me a big red ball. I took the ball outside while my mom and 2 older brothers were in the house finishing up chores. I  m kicking the ball around and wind up in the back yard with it. There was a foldable chaise my mom used to lay out in. So I started kicking the ball around that chair playing soccer in my head with this big red ball. I kicked it really hard and it rolled to that small thicket behind the house and stopped at the fence. I ran really fast after it  bent down to pick it up and when I had the ball in my hands I heard something above me I looked up and there was this huge monster as I described at the time. It had it  s huge hands on the fence bending over the fence at me. It wasn  t too far from my face and looked me right in the eyes. I was starting to scream  but it took me a minute because I was frozen. It looked at me like it was studying me and when I started to scream it neared it  s mouth open at me and it  s human like eyes was darting around my house. (Because I was screaming at the top of my lungs by then.)  And i knew it knew it was in deep crap  i kept screaming and i was running backward away from it while i was screaming bloody murder. I saw it up close and very personal.  I felt at the time it wanted me  not sure if it wanted me for food or as a pet. As I was running backwards from it and it was looking at my house and decided to run from me. By this time I was up against my house screaming with my nails dug into my house. My mom came running from the front of the house and my brothers came from the other side of the house. They were asking me what  s wrong what happen?! My mom thought I was hurt. She was looking for blood. My brothers and mom were asking me questions and I never took my eyes off where I last saw it. My mom and brothers finally got me calmed down enough to tell them about the monster I saw. At first my mom didn  t know what to think. She got scared herself. My 2 brothers were scared out of their wits when I told them and my mom. My brothers had been telling my mom that when they go fishing in the thicket pond there would be rocks thrown into the water and were blaming each other at first. Then they thought my dad was messing with them  but he  d be at work during that time. My bothers were very shaken at me seeing this monster. Looking back now at this it makes me wonder if it had been watching us for quite some time..waiting...After I told them of this experience they did not go back to the pond by themselves after this. I was 5-6 and they are 7 and 9 years older than me. It  s waist was well over the barbed wire fence which the top wire came midway to top of a quarter horses back. The top wire came to the monsters upper mid thigh. Human type eyes you could tell it was very smart because when I started screaming it immediately looked right at my house for other humans and got nervous. I felt It wanted me.  It had long orangutan colored hair all over it. The hands looked like a gorilla but had a full thumb like a human  and not the nub like a gorilla. It had hazel yellowish eyes. It  s face covered with leathery looking skin with hair. Long arms very muscular. Walked and ran on two legs. It smelled like a unkempt wet dog  mixed with a skunk and goat smell. Many years later visiting a zoo I smelled the primates section and my memory was like yeah that primate smell with goat and skunk and dog. My brother was a very good artist and some years later he had me describe it to him in detail and he drew it exactly  but have since lost the paper. This thing wanted me and as a child I suffered trauma from experiencing this. I wish I would  ve never seen it. I used to tell people about it until I got to my mid 20  s and got made fun of for seeing it an â€œimaginaryâ€ creature. It wasn  t until I was 12 or 13 that I came across that bigfoot movie that  s real popular. I fell out because I showed it to my mom and said MOM!  This is what it was but it didn  t look like this it was orange colored. Then I knew I saw a Bigfoot that day. It  s permanently in my mind of that day I will never forget. This was 1978  no internet  no cnbc  no cnn. We didn  t watch a lot of TV then. I know what I saw. It wasn  t my imagination like my dad said it must be. It wasn  t till I got older and kept telling him the story over and over exactly the same that he finally said I believe you. I only wanted to protect you and didn  t want to admit that I believed you then. But we did move to Washington state right after that! Looking back now I  m like really??dad! But he didn  t know...That  s where they all are. But really they are all over the States. They are very intelligent. That  s the just of my first encounterâ€¦.I HAD A 2ND ONE years later. Even though I had that encounter previously that didn  t stop me from being a country kid. I still hunted in the woods but I didn  t go unless I was armed. This time it was about 25 miles south of Hope  Arkansas in a town called Bodcaw  Arkansas. Lots of timber and dirt roads chicken houses some houses are as close together as a mile. It  s country! I was 16 and a few of us would sometimes sneak out at night and go to this spot in the woods to have a bonfire and drink whatever we could snag from our parents liquor cabinet. So  where I lived on this dirt road off the hwy 32 it dipped downhill back up a big hill them ran flat. We lived after those 2 hills. If i sat on the first hill looking toward the highway I could see headlights turn in. So I sneaked out of my house start walking down by the dirt road to wait on my friends to get there. All is quiet  normal nighttime noises and such. I get to the hill and wait on the dirt road for them. Back then we didn  t have cell phones we just had to time things right. So I  m sitting on this hill and there is huge pasture behind me  I faced the woods. I light up a cigarette and I  m sitting there on the dirt waiting on my friends. I  m hearing some deer running through the woods and they are taking the low ground on each side of the hill. Full moon very bright. Some run through there  being a hunter myself I started to wonder what  s chasing these deer? Coyotes? Panthers? So I am listening  more deer are running through on each side of the hill. I thought what in the world?!! Thats a lot of deer!! WHAT COULD HAVE had them so spooked like this. Now I  m seeing a lot more deer! Like a stampede of them. I  m not talking 5 or 6 deer. I could see them in the moonlight clearly. The most deer I have ever saw at one time. Well over 50 and more. I  m still sitting on this hill and by then I  m kinda getting nervous there is still more coming but im hearing huge heavy steps but the 2 legged kind all spread out. More than one. I  m still on this hill all bug eyed. Hairs all over my body start going up and I  m praying that whatever it is isn  t going to come out on top of this hill. All of this didn  t take 10 minutes from the first few deer that flew out of the woods  to the stampede to the elephant sounding footsteps. I  m still on the hill looking back and forth at the bottom of these hills. I saw 2 bigfoots run to the left and 3 run to my right. They didn  t miss a step in chasing these deer following these deer exactly where they ran and they are fast. It was a flash of them. At first I  m like ok it was a bear  but bears don  t run that fast on 2 legs and it was too tall and too heavy to be a bear. Not wanting to admit to myself i just got caught in the middle of a feeding! I heard all 5 of them clear the fence behind me like a deer and they were trying to gather the deer into an open spot to snag them. I turn around to the pasture to try to see the commotion  but I heard the huge footsteps fading as fast as they got there. Clouds started covering any light I had to see anything..then I thought what if there is more and here my ass is a sitting duck. I was froze there for a minute not wanting to bring attention to myself as a â€œlost deerâ€ or a potentially tasty morsel that  s better than deer. How do I know?!  I took of running full blast to my house Â¼ mile away from that hill I was on. I didn  t stop till I got in my house. Luckily I didn  t wake up my parents! I eventually told them about what happened to me that night. And they were too occupied with me sneaking out to listen to what I saw! So over the next few days I had asked the landowner that had the hay pasture my back was turned to if he found any dead deer in his pasture when he mowed for hay. He knew I was a hunter and asked me usual questions about what was I hunting with and things related to that. I didn  t tell him about the stampede or anything. I wanted to know if he saw anything the next day in his pasture. Hurt animals and such. He also had cows but they we  re on another fenced pasture and he kept that one clear of cattle for hay. He said I have in the past came across a dead cow here and there  but no deer. So I went to look to see if I could find any evidence of these things. During the daylight bright noon! I looked at the fence where they all jumped over and I found hairs but it looked to be mostly deer. I saw lots of deer tracks on either side of that hill but no footprints or track prints of anything but deer. I  ve seen these things run full blast. It  s unbelievable at how fast they are! They can cover a lot of ground in just a short time.  I know what I saw that night on the hill. It was no bear or anything that had 4 legs. It wasn  t anyone in suits  because why would weird people run around in suits chasing deer and humans can not run that fast. I knew after they past me over the fence I smelled their stench. Primate  wet dog  goat and skunk. These were black not the orange color of the other one I saw. The moon was big full and bright that night and I could tell the color of the deer while they were running full blast past me. Needless to sayâ€¦.that was the last time I sat on a dirt road at night by myself with nothing but a cigarette. I could wrap my brain over the fact that I just saw them in a feeding frenzy  and they hunted in a group! Triangulated the deer to an open area for an easier catch. That in itself was amazing to me. ,Just east of Hope Arkansas and beside State highway 73. ,Hempstead,1,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5057,yes
240,It was during the 1973 spring squirrel season in southern  Arkansas. My brother and I were hunting near the Jenkins Ferry national historic site. He is four years younger than me  I was 17 years old and my brother was 13. It was early morning before sun-up. We were squirrel hunting with my dad. When we left the truck  my dad went down in the woods by himself and me and my brother walked down this gravel road deep in the forest where there was water on both sides of the road. The sun was coming up and we were standing in the road waiting for it to get light enough  to go into the woods.  I was looking down the road toward the sun. On the left side of the road under a big tree was a very tall - at least 8 feet - figure covered with hair from top to bottom. It was on the side of the road in the tree line. It then stepped on the edge of the road. I noticed that he wasn  t wearing any clothes or carrying a gun  and it was too big to be a human. Me and my brother squatted down in tall grass next to the road. The figure then came to the edge of the road and just stood there. It looked straight up and he looked to his left. We were on his right and by then we were in the grass and he did not see us. My brother took aim at him with his .22 caliber rifle that always jams after firing just one shot. I asked him what he was doing. He said that is not a person and  if he comes this way I  m going to shoot him. I told my brother don  t shoot  the gun will jam. I had a single barrel 16 gauge shotgun with squirrel shot. We just sat there in the tall grass and watched the figure walk across the gravel road. The animal took at least three steps and he was across the road. Its  arms very long and I noticed that there was long hair hanging from his arms. Its foot slid when it stepped off the road and onto the right-hand shoulder. Then one foot began sliding  causing the animal to lose its balance for a second  nearly falling backwards  just before it stepped into the water. Once in the water  It started walking into the woods and he never seen me and my brother.  We got up and ran back to the truck. The truck was locked but I knew the wing window on the passenger side didn  t lock. I opened up the wing window and reached in and opened the truck  door and me and my brother got inside. We started honking the horn until my dad came out of the woods. We told him what we had seen. He said he did not see the creature but he heard something very large walking through the woods breaking sticks and limbs. My dad took the safety off of his shotgun  and waited and listened for a little while before getting in the truck. We left the area never went back there to hunt again. It has taken me all these years to tell the story. My brother and myself have told people in our family and they think we  re crazy  but me and my brother know what we saw that day. I have been all over the world and I  ve hunted in a lot of different states  but I  ve never seen anything like this before or after that day. ,It was on a unnamed  graveled woods road near the Jenkins Ferry Battleground Historical Monument. ,Grant,9,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5053,yes
241,A male friend and I left a local nightclub to go sit quietly by the lake. We had both had a couple of beers in a 5 hour period  but this was around midnight-12 30 am on Saturday night  Sunday morning. Neither of us were drunk  or tipsy at that time. I loved nature  and always spent as much time as possible in the outdoors. It was a beautiful night  with a full moon and we decided to go to Lake Hamiliton  about a 13 minute drive on the highway from our location. We were in a truck  and took the access road and parked so we were facing the lake. Surrounding the lake is very thick woods  and this particular area was for fishing and not used very much. We got into the back of the truck  and sat on a blanket  enjoying the peace and quiet. We heard the normal sounds  an owl  a branch creak  etc but nothing out of the ordinary. The moon was extremely bright  and it was easy to see about 2/3 of the lake shore. Around 1am or so  I noticed a dark shape to my right. My friend was on my left  and I motioned to him to be quiet. I made the shhh sound. At first we couldnt identify species or size  because it went in and our of visual field. The creature seemed to be walking around the lake  sticking close to the woods and forest. There is a small stretch  about 100 yards where they have made access for fishing  and the creature was almost to that point  which would put him straight across from us  about 75 feet away. We both saw it at the same moment  and looked at each other  wide eyed and open mouthed and then looked back to the creature. It was too far off to see tiny details of the face  but close enough to note the following; it was substanially larger than even a big man. It had to be at least 8 feet  it appeared to be covered in fur or hair  and it had walked upright the entire time we watched it. I am familiar and have seen MANY bears in the wild and this was NOT a bear! It  s posture was upright  yes a bit stooped. It had long arms  long like a humans  but not overly long  I would say its arms reached about mid thigh. It had a flattened face  and big rather dense bone on the arms and legs. It resembled NOTHING I  nor my friend had ever seen before. I grabbed his arm  and as I did  the creature turned  and startled  seemingly as if spotting us for the first time. He seemed to waiver on what to do.. as if he wasnt sure if he should receed or move forward. At the moment he began walking in our direction  towards the truck we both literally jumped up off the truck bed  and into the cab of the truck! I looked through my window  as he was starting the truck and advised him it was still  walking  towards us. At that time I rolled down my window  and realized it was only probably 25 feet from our truck  I said  go.. go.. go.. and he sped off. We discussed this over and over again  but could not come up with any creature that could possibly have been what we saw. This was back before I had ever even heard of  bigfoot  and so I had no knowledge that such a creature even existed. Around 1999  I came across some articles online about bigfoot  and when I read the descriptions  my blood ran cold. It was EXACTLY what my friend and I had seen that night. It surely was not anyone in costume  we made the decision late one night to go to the lake  and we know it wasn  t a bear. I know in my heart that what I saw was a bigfoot  and no one could ever convince me othwerise. ,Lake Hamilton  access road to the lake for fishing. ,Garland,1,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5051,yes
242,In the spring of 1997 I had to make a trip to Jonesboro Arkansas. Since I live in Fayetteville Arkansas the best way was across Hgwy 463 across the top of the state. (I think thats the hgwy #  Its the only time i  ve ever been on that road) Anyway  I finished my business and was returning home that evening. It was around 9 PM when I passed thru a small town named Salem. With the town behind me I was once again the only car on the hgwy  my headlights were on brite  the windows were up cause I had the heater on and the radio was playing softly. There was a clearance of maybe 20 feet between the edge of the road and the woods when I noticed what I thought was a tree standing right beside the road. As I got closer the tree turned and took just a few steps and was at the woods. It was HUGE and had long  matted hair. Actually it looked quite nasty. It never looked directly at me. It was slipping into the woods as I passed to the point of it going out of my headlights beam. I stomped on the gas with everything I had and didn  t slow down till I was safely in the lights of the next town. As I drove wildly down the highway at 90 miles an hour (Thats as fast as the car I was driving would go) I kept looking in the rear view mirror to make sure it wasn  t chasing me. I know that sounds nutty but at the time it seemed like a really good idea. I was perfectly sober at the time  maybe that should be a lesson to me ,It was a few miles west of Salem Arkansas. Its the only time i  ve evered travelled that highway so thats about all I can tell you. ,Fulton,17,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5049,yes
243,i went fishing last spring. found really weird tracks. i took pictures. i worked in a hospital at that time. i showed the pics to several ortho doctors and 4 podiatrists (foot doctors). they all said the same thing.  Not made by a person  as in not h.s.s.. i then showed them to several people that hunt bear. they all said  not made by a bear . the tracks had a large toe print and no arch. they were wider than my size 12 water boot but only 2/3 the length. how do i send these pics to you? they tracks went into an area that was dead ended by 2 creeks. the tracks went in then turned around and went back. the next day i took my go  shein akita out there. he is not scared of anything and has went after a black bear with no hesitation. he hit the tracks  got the scent and turned around and left. i found him back at the car trying to get inside. he hates getting in the car and never does it willingly. he was more than willing then. i have pics of right and left tracks with objects for size reference. ,on the way to the grassy lake w.m.a. ,Faulkner,1,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5045,no
244,I had an incident  I shot a doe behind my house. It was frosty and around sunset. I left her over night deciding to get her and clean her the next morning. When I went out there she was gone. There was no sign that she had been drug to where she was at. She had been carried approx 120 yards then laid down and she was not torn apart like coyotes. I have been in the woods all my life and never seen anything like it. I had a very eerie feeling and decided to get out of there and haven  t been back there after dark since. , ,Drew,1,Arkansas ,AR,Winter ,5043,yes
245,June 14th  1979 I was traveling with a friend north about 30 mph on the White River levee gravel road in the White River NWR from a June fishing trip at Scrubgrass Lake in Desha County Arkansas.  It was dusk (8 00 PM ish) and had my vehicle headlights on but  could have driven without them.  About one mile (34.173758 -91.072666)  south of the White River NWR Pumping Station I saw an ape like human form walking upright and tilted slightly forward at a brisk pace up the right (east) side of the levy emerging up from tall grass.  The animal came into full view about 100 feet in front of the vehicle headlights.  It continued walking West upright across the two lane gravel road which is on top of the levee.  It was walking with a human like gait and swinging both arms and I estimated it to be seven feet tall.  It was covered in long dark reddish brown hair all over  from head to toe.  It had long arms  long legs  a neck and head.  I did not see the face and it appeared not to have noticed the vehicle we were in.  It didn  t take long for it to travel across the road and continue West down into the tall grass on the left side of the levee and disappear.  By the time I had slowed down it was out of sight.  The truck windows were open and as I passed through the path the it had take across the road there was a very very strong odor that smelled musty and putrid like a big cat exhibit in an older municipal zoo.

246,In May 2001  my wife and I were traveling from Pine Bluff  AR to Watson AR  a town 16 miles east of Dumas  AR. It was late at night  about 1 00 a.m. I don  t remember the exact date but it was late May. I  m not from this area and my wife  s relatives had told me about sightings in the past. I wasn  t convinced. However  on this night my attitude changed. My wife  of course  was asleep so I  m the only one that saw it. We were about five miles outside of Watson on Hwy. 1  when suddenly I saw a tremendous blur of white about 30 yards in front of the car. It was a large animal or man at least 7 feet tall tearing across the road. I yelled at my wife   did you see that?! . Of course  she did not. But I believe what I saw to be a bigfoot or sasquatch. ,Take Hwy 1 from Dumas  AR towards Watson  AR. ,Desha,2,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5041,yes
247,I WAS GOING UP TO HARDY AR.TO LOOK AT SOME LAND I HAVE ON WHITE HORSE MT. THE ROAD UP THERE IS GRAVEL. AS I WAS COMING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BLACK BEAR IN THE ROAD. I HONKED MY HORN  THEN A FEMALE BIGFOOT CAME OUT FROM BEHIND SOME TREES PICKED UP WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BEAR BUT WAS A YOUNG BIGFOOT. YOU COULD TELL IT WAS A FEMALE BECAUSE IT HAD BREASTS. SHE WAS A DARK BROWN ABOUT 7 FT TALL THE BABY WAS DARK BLACK. SHE WALKED OUT FROM THE TREES PICKED UP THE BABY AND WENT BACK IN TO THE TREES. I MUST SAY I WAS SCARED. I OPENED MY DOOR TO SEE WHERE SHE WAS GOING WHEN A SMALL ROCK HIT MY CAR FROM BEHIND ME. I TURN TO SEE ANTHER BIGFOOT ABOUT 6 FT FROM MY CAR. THIS ONE WAS BIGGER ABOUT 9 FT TALL . THE BIGFOOT YELLED AT ME WITH A SOUND LIKE I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE  I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS. THIS WAS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE HEARD OR SEEN IN MY LIFE.  I GOT BACK IN MY CAR. IT WAS STILL BEHIND MY CAR THEN IT WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD AND  INTO THE WOODS. I DROVE UP THE ROAD ABOUT 150 YARDS  STOPPED AND GOT OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I JUST SAW I WAS SCARED AND CONFUSED STILL LOOKING TO SEE IF I MIGHT SEE AND HEAR WHERE THEY WENT. WHEN I GOT MORE ROCKS HITTING MY CAR AND AROUND ME FROM WHERE THE BIG BIGFOOT WENT IN TO THE WOODS. I COULD HEAR HIM. I DON  T THINK HE WANTED TO HURT ME BUT HE WANTED ME OUT OF THERE.

248,I have always been reluctant to tell this story because I am still not sure to this day what I actually witnessed. One night  early 1988 in Greene County  Arkansas  just outside of Paragould  my girlfriend and I were  parking  behind a school gymnasium. We had visited this location on many previous occasions without any strange occurances. This particular night was cold  about 40 degrees  but clear and no moon. The only light was from a distant yard light on the school grounds. Off to our right front side was a tennis court with 4 foot high chain link fence along the sides and 10 foot high chain link fence on each end. As the night moved on  my girlfriend and I got the feeling that we were being watched. We were unable to see any movement outside the truck and we did not hear any sounds  just the strange feeling. It was around 11 pm and as we started to leave  I noticed a dark figure standing next to the 10 foot tall section of the chain link fence. What ever it was stood approximately 8 1/2 to 9 feet tall and we could see it swaying slightly from side to side. It was approximately 30 yards away. With only the dim  distant light  I could only make out that it was dark in color and I was unable to distinguish any facial features or hair length. A wooded tree line stood about 30 yards away from the creature. We were both scared and did not want to scare or anger this thing  so we sit quietly for about 10 minutes trying to guess what it was. Then it turned from us and slowly walked toward the woodline  turning it  s head to look back at us before disappering into the woods. We then left the area quickly. The next day  still scared  I returned in the daylight. I was unable to find any evidence that a creature was ever there. ,From Paragould  take highway 135 north approximately 5 miles and you will come to Oak Grove Heights.

249,I was squirrel hunting/scouting for deer signs when I came to the top of a small hill.  About 50 yards below me was a large  dark colored creature walking on 2 legs following a fence row.  I  watched it for about 8-10 seconds before it disappeared. I didn  t think to compare it to any tree branches to see how tall it was  but it was at least 6 to 7 feet tall. I didn  t follow it at the time  I have to admit I was scared.  I came back later  but couldn  t find any traces or tracks because the ground was very hard. ,About 2 miles from Caney  Arkansas in Hot Spring County. ,Hot Spring,6,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5059,yes
250,Several friends and myself had gone together to purchase 120 acres of cut-over forest land that was totally surrounded by several thousand acres of timber company land.  This land was at the end of a small valley  and at the far end of a dead-end road. On my portion of the land was a small rise in the northern half of the valley  and I was building a shack to be used for hunting and camping.  One night about 8 00  while working inside by lantern light  I decided to step outside on the deck for a cigarette.  As soon as I lit my lighter  a roaring  crackling scream commenced from the slope of the ridge to the south; about 300 yards away  but in direct line of sight.  I was too startled to do anything but stay rooted to the spot and feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck; something which hasn  t happened to me in years.  While the scream lasted for only a couple of seconds  it seemed to go on much longer. Since it was very cloudy and dark I ran inside for a flashlight  all the while wishing I had brought my rifle inside from the truck.  With a flashlight and a hatchet I headed for the truck only to find that the truck itself seemed to be moving.  In the bed of the truck I found my German Shepherd ( I had forgotten all about him.) curled in a tight ball in the corner and shaking so hard he was moving the whole truck. We left immediately. Several nights later  one of the friends who had laughed at me when I told the story came out to see how I was progressing with the shack.  He laughed more at the extra lanterns I had placed inside and outside  and at the pistol and shotgun I had laying on the table.  We stepped out onto the lit deck and almost immediately the same grating scream came from exactly the same spot on the south ridge.  In a flash my friend was standing back to back with me as we stared out into the dark. Since the dog was not with us  and because we were armed and had good flashlights  we stayed there for two more hours  but heard nothing else.  But I was certainly glad to have a witness this time. Several weeks later my friend and I ran into one of the other property owners and were relating the story to him when I noticed him becoming a bit pale.  He finally told us that he had been burning piles of deadfall on his part of the property - that butts into the south ridge - and was walking back and fourth to the stream to get water to put out the several fires when he heard something walking around him in the woods.  It was too dark to see  but he at first assumed it was a deer or maybe a bear.  After he had listened for awhile he decided it sounded like a two-legged creature and believed it was one of us trying to play a joke on him.  So he continued putting out his fires while listening to whatever it was make a circle around him.  But when it got upwind from him he began to smell a terrible odor that he admitted scared him so badly that he got in his truck and left  ignoring his still smoldering fires. I cannot say what it was that we heard  or what the other man smelled. But I have heard several kinds of big cats  bears  howler monkeys and other large animals in my years hunting and in the Army  and I have never heard anything that sounded remotely like what was heard those two nights. ,Witness requested that location not be disclosed. ,Hot Spring,6,Arkansas ,AR,Winter ,5059,yes
251,Wednesday  October  12  2005 our neighbors dogs were very active and barking all night.  The next morning about 5 30am my own dog was barking in the backyard.  I opened the door to calm her down and I heard something in the back of our property near the fruit trees.  It was very heavy sounding and I could hear branches breaking as it departed.  The next morning around 8 30am my husband went to his truck in the backyard and heard something behind our shop take off running.  He thought it was a hunter and ran to the back to listen.  He thought it sounded like it was on two feet.  He said it stomped very heavily as it was running through the woods and he could hear snorting.  Sunday  October 16th  I went walking around the neighborhood road and discovered several sets of large and small barefootprints on the gray slate road in front of our house.  At first I thought it was a childs footprint until I looked closer.  There were two sets.  The largest measured 13.5 by 7 inches and the small print measured 9 by 4 inches. I took pictures of all the prints and measured each print.  They consistenly measured the same size.  The large print is about 3 inches wider than my husbands foot and he  s a big man. ,This area is in the Arlie Moore area of the corp land surrounding Lake DeGray. ,Hot Spring,6,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5059,no
252,On 12/4/05  at approximately 8 15 a.m. I was standing approximately 50 yards from the south-west corner boundary marker of my property when I heard the neighbors dogs start to bark and run southward on Arkansas Highway 7. They only ran a short distance before stopping. I immediately thought that they must be barking at a deer that was crossing the road.  My first thought was to get my gun from my truck.  Then  I remembered that I had parked outside the fence in front of my house.  So  I decided to just stand there and see if it was a doe or buck and hope it would not feel pressured since the dogs had stopped barking.  I also believed the deer would change directions if it saw me hurrying in its same general direction.  Therefore  I just stood still and waited in hopes of getting a glimpse of it.  Then  if the dogs would keep quiet  I could hunt it later.  Only one got to see it for 2 to 3 seconds  but I saw it clearly. My first impression was that I was observing a very large man who was wearing a hooded black parka  then I realized it was some kind of animal.  It was approximately 50 yards away and was on the opposite side of an old fence that has been overtaken by grass  weeds  vines etc. I only had a left side view as it was traveling east along an old fence row.  It covered a distance of about 20 yards in about 3 seconds.  I could only see its upper body.  I could see that it was not a bear but I couldn  t make out distinct facial features from the side from that distance.  It was like an ape in some ways but its posture appeared more man-like. I can best describe the size by comparing it to a very large man I know who is approximately 6â€™9â€™â€™ and weighs roughly 280 pounds.  This creature was least that tall  possible a little taller  but close to the same build. I did not get a long view of it. I probably would not have had time to take a picture even if I would have had a camera in my hand. It was moving at a brisk pace  but not lightening fast.  Its stride resembled a trot or a jog.  The body was moving quickly but there was no up and down motion. It appeared to have a moderately thick coat of black hair. From what I could tell its face was dark too  as if there was some hair on its face. It was moving through a well used deer crossing. There is an old fence row there  on of both sides of Arkansas Highway 7.  The west fence row had recently been cleared and the east side was logged about five years ago and has a fair amount of undergrowth and a game trail running along the south side of the fence row. Just a little to the south west of the spot there is a thicket that is approximately 3 acres in size.  There are a couple partial open areas in the woods here. Most parts of this thicket can be walked through fairly easily. In places the thicket is too thick to move through without clippers and or a machete. I did not see where the creature crossed Arkansas Highway 7 but it most likely came from an area that is about 40 yards away from the highwayâ€™s west side ride-of-way. I believe that this creature waited until there were no cars coming becoming before crossing the road.  I did not get the impression that it was running from something. I have mentally replayed the entire scenario many times and I have stood and looked at the same area where the creature was seen. I looked for tracks after the incident but the ground was too brushy for obvious tracks. I  ve stood in the spot where I observed the creature from.

253,Late one night my wife and I decided to go on a moonlit walk on our property to find good spots to look up at the stars because we were considering on getting a telescope. we got into the car and drove the very end of our driveway and parked  our driveway is approximately a quarter of a mile of the main road with thick Woods on both sides. we started walking up the driveway about halfway up we felt like we were being watched so we stopped and we started hearing very loud noises in the woods to the left. it sounded like something was running towards us  shocked and panicking my wife turn and started running back towards the vehicle. (Reba) - I wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. I told my husband to come on  and he told me to go ahead. so I ran back to the car as fast as I could. I got into the car lock the doors. (Jason)- after my wife ran back to the vehicle  I immediately got a flashlight out of my pocket to scan the woods. I did not feel comfortable turning my back on whatever this was. I smelled a foul in the air. it is hard to describe this odor. the best way to describe it is an overwhelming nauseating odor it smelled like a mixture of roadkill and a wet dog with a faint sent of sulfur ( the best description of the sulfur smell is the smell after striking a match and blowing it out but more potent). my heart was racing and my palms were sweaty. my senses were hightened and my body went into a state of alert from fear  which is not normal for me. I grew up my whole life hunting entering the woods well before daylight and exiting the woods well after sundown. I know what deer sound like running through the woods  and I  m familiar with local wildlife like Bobcats  coyotes  raccoons  Panthers  wild hogs  etc. I  m not easily scared  there has been times that I have had to leave the woods with nothing but the backlight of a cell phone. so I don  t scare easily. but this animal kept charging at me a little at a time then it would stop and charge again  it was so loud that it sounded like a bull elephant coming through the woods at me this was when I knew it was something that I had never heard before. I never did get a glimpse of the creature. I did not see any eye shine i search high and low scanning the woods. the animal had to be far enough into the woods to where I could not see it but it sounded like it was right next to me in the edge of the woods. at this point I slowly back up the hill never turn my back and always keeping the flashlight on scanning the woods. not knowing what to expect i built up enough courage to shout out   that  s enough  just stay back  in a stern  loud voice... I doubt the creature understood anything I just said but I was hoping the tone I used would be enough to make it stop coming towards me. then shortly after I shouted everything began to calm and I think it understood that we were leaving the area. after feeling that I was being watched and pushed out of the area  I finally reached the top of the hill and felt it was safe to turn around so I ran the rest of the way to the car. my wife had the doors locked so I flash my light and tapped on the window  she immediately unlocked the doors and I got in  then she immediately locked the doors back and we drove back up to the house. this was the first of many occurrences that happened on the property. is seemed that after this encounter the activity picked up in the following months. I have heard many stories at deer camp about people seeing this creature but I always dismissed it as a folklore  but this experience made me realize that there is really something out there. this made me have the desire to look into it further and do some of my own research because I felt as if I were losing it. as I replay the events in my head  I tried to make sense of all this but the research I have done seems to bring me more questions than answers. ,The exact location of the property is not disclosed at the request of the witnesses.

254,I was gathering some firewood from a stack of previously split wood behind my house. I kept hearing a strange  whooping  sound coming from the thick woods about 100 yards away. My nearest neighbor has horses which I could hear bolting away about the same time. My dog ran to the edge of the woods and kept barking and running around back and forth in that area. I have never heard these kind of sounds before. It was after dark about 9 00 pm. I also could faintly smell a very odd smell. Strangly enough the smell reminded me of a zoo. The incident lasted about one or two minutes. I believe that I was being watched. ,The area is near the small community of Salado.

255,My children and I were driving back from my mothers home in Cushman  AR on Thanksgiving day around 10 PM. We were approaching Newark on hwy 65 south. Just outside of Newark  Macedonia Road turns off the hwy to the left. We had to stop for traffic as we came up on that road. There were 2 cars in front of us...the 1 in front was waiting to turn left onto Macedonia Rd. There were 3 cars in oncoming traffic and 1 car on Macedonia Rd waiting to turn left onto hwy 65 toward Newark. As our truck slowed due to the stopped traffic ahead of us  I saw something very dark in a crouched position behind the car directly in front of us. As the vehicles started to move the figure stood and stepped all in one motion off the side of the hwy. It was on 2 legs and taller that the cab of our full size pick up. In the crouched position it was taller than the hood of my truck. You could see the profile of a head  shoulders  back  buttocks  legs and arms swinging wide. I was speechless. My daughter  11 at the time  also saw  the figure and said  Did you see that??  As she locked her door. I was a MAJOR skeptic until this. It really left me scratching my head. I had heard stories of sightings around here  but never believed any of them. ,Newark is a rural town. There were probably 3 houses within 100 yds. ,Independence,3,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5063,yes
256,I was walking to do some night fishin. It was a small gravel road. The road ends into the first old river but it  s where two rivers  the first old and the red. There are slews and backwater holes from them and on both sides of the road was woods. The sun just started to drop but still there was plenty of light. I was in the middle of the small road and I heard something like the woods being knocked down so I stopped and turned to the right and I saw a reddish brown creature run toward me. Before it got to the road it turned on a dime headed toward the river. It was moving incredibly fast. It happened so quick I never got a look at his face but from the shoulders on down. The road was at the least a foot higher than the ground and I was below his shoulder. At the most he was 25 to 30 feet away from me. ,In the middle of nowhere about 8 miles north of texarkana texas off of north 71 turn on north 71 headed out of texarkana cross over red river bridge go around two more miles turn right on the first road that goes right follow that road it ends into the first old river when you pass the last farm it will be on the right that  s when the woods start where I saw the bigfoot ,Little River,2,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5081,yes
257,Location  2334 River Mountain Road Delaware  AR 72835 35.309576  -93.375676 I saw a white Bigfoot in Arkansas  circa 1976-1977. It was during the summer  probably July or August. It was around 8 in the morning. I was on vacation with my family to see relatives. I was walking across the road to go see my friend who lived across the road. This is in a very secluded area and these were the only two houses in the area. It was all dense trees  except for this one area that was cleared of trees and had a pond in the middle of it. I looked out to my left and saw this very tall white thing walking. It was walking along a barbwire fence from my left to right (East to West) from one tree line to the other. As my walking slowed trying to comprehend what it was  a fear came over me. Fortunately it hadn  t spotted me yet. I looked to my left in front of me was a tree stump next to a barbwire fence. I instantly crouched down and moved as quick as I could without drawing attention to myself and to position myself behind the stump  and I continued to watch it walk out of sight. Fortunately it never did look in my direction. I never saw its face or hands but the hair seemed silvery white  similar in shades to aluminum foil. I later figured out that the barbwire fence that ran around that whole area was 4   tall. It was easily double the height of the fence  so I would say in the 8  -10   tall range. It was slender and not bulky like Patty from the Patterson-Gimlin footage. I only ever told that friend about it  because I didn  t know what it was and wondered if my eyes were playing a trick on me  because back then  no one ever heard of a white bigfoot  let alone realize that they come in all colors  similar to human hair.

258,In the summer of 1986 my brother and myself where driving home from Paris on Hwy 22. I was driving and my brother had fallen asleep. I was driving east just about 1/4 of a mile east of skating rink road. I was watching the roadway when a large reddish brown animal ran in front of my car. I barely missed the creature. I clearly saw that it was on two legs and had long fur as we went by. I slammed on my brakes and screamed out when I had first saw it. My brother startled awake and I asked him if he had seen that. He did not. I looked in my rear view mirror but did not see the creature anymore. I have had several animals run in front of my car from horses  cows  deer and once a pig. I played over what I had seen over and over and realized that it wasnâ€™t any animal I had ever seen before. I know it was huge bigger than a man. ,about 4-5 miles east of Subiaco.

259,I believe this incident occurred in the summer of 1981  when I was sixteen.  I was out of school at the time  and my best friend and I were out partaking in one of our favorite pastimes  spelunking of the amatueur sort.  Our particular goal that day was the finding of a cave called Turner  s Cave  one we  d heard about from my parents who said it had been a designated government fallout shelter.  We knew of one that might qualify  as it had a large entrance and such  but it didn  t seem large enough for a fallout shelter to us.  We explored it once more (we  d been in it before)  and then decided to move on down the creekbed and try to find another that might be it. The creekbed was dry  so the walking was easy.  About a quarter-mile or so downstream from the cave  s entrance  we happened upon an old logging road and decided to check out the other side of the ridge  as this side wasn  t looking promising.  We followed the logging road  which ascended the ridge at an angle  until we reached the top. At the top  the woods ended at a fenceline which bordered open pasture.  It was about noon by then  maybe early afternoon  and we decided to sit down and take a break  as it was hot.  So we crossed the fence and sat down on the grass of the pasture. We had been sitting thus for probably five or ten minutes when I realized I was hearing something in the woods behind me.  Growing up in the country  I was used to hearing animals in the leaves of the forest floor  but I think what made me actually pay attention to this one was that I realized that it wasn  t moving in a way I was used to hearing.  I looked at my friend  who seemed to realize this at about the same time  and I said   That  s not a squirrel (which is what I had thought it to be at first).  We both rose and turned when suddenly my friend grabbed me and yelled  Look at that!   I followed his direction and could distinctly see the arm and leg of something tall and hairy standing behind a tree. We both froze in place  too afraid to do anything much.  My friend wanted to run  but I warned him not to.  Eventually  the manimal seemed to just disappear with hardly a sound. Much subdued  we decided to leave and followed the old logging road back out of the area  and my friend told me that he saw a track in the sand at the edge of the creekbed.  He also had a better view than I did and said he could see the face and body. ,Top of ridge some three miles or so from highway 412 ,Madison,38,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,1089,yes
260,I live in Kansas City Mo the year was 1983 some friends and I went on a backpacking outing in Arkansas just across the border from Missouri close to Fayettville Ark about 20 miles east of town.The area was very wooded with lots of hills and valleys on our second day there about 3 miles from our camp we came across 3 nest they were about 8 foot long oval shaped nest I call them nest because they were made from rocks positioned in a oval pattern and the inside filled with leaves and beside 2 of these nest there were large tree branches cleaned of bark slick we stood around looking at them a few minutes when someone yelled come look at this doody the pile that was there was huge we guessed maybe bear stuff but ive never seen bear stuff but the hair stood up on my neck we left walked about a mile when we came upon a pine tree the bark had been striped off it I mean like something climbed to the top sunk in its fingernails and slid down peeling it off in strips 15 ft long we stayed 2 more days heard many spooky noises but never saw anything ,Across the border from Missouri close to Fayettville Arkansas.

261,We had things happen that we did not realize were possibly Bigfoot related. 1. There was a owl that would hoot every night. Louder than any owl I have ever heard in my life. We used to joke that it must be as big as a man.  It was also slightly off sounding. Also  it called like this all year long. Not seasonally. 2. Our kids became afraid to sleep in their rooms. They said someone was watching them. They never saw anything  but said they just felt weird. So they slept in our room with us. One night around 2 a.m. we were all woken up by a pounding on our house. Pounding so hard on the other side of the house that our bedroom windows were rattling. My husband yelled and it didn  t let up at all. Just a rythmic pounding. Our gun case was in the room closest to the banging. My husband jerked that door open  grabbed his gun and ran outside with a flashlight. There was nothing there. He ran around the house and still didn  t see anything. The next day we walked around the house looking for prints of some sort and there were no visible prints. The grass was very thick and lush at the time. Our nearest neighbors were over a mile away. This was about June 2002. 3. We had a momma goat that gave birth to twins. We found her and one baby dead by a pond about a mile from the house. Not much left of either except the hides. We thought it was coyotes or maybe a mountain lion  but even then it seemed unlikely. More like they were carried there. No drag marks anywhere. 4. Our new neighbors and their children came over for dinner. My husband and our neighbor went to check Gates and cattle in a pickup. The kids were playing outside in the yard and the wife and I were talking in the living room with the door open so we could hear the kids. About 45 min before sunset her 13 year old son came up to the house and told us he was scared. His mom asked why and he said he heard something weird in the woods. He was starting to tear up while he was telling us but his mom said oh stop that  go play. And he did. I yelled at the kids and told them to come closer to the house and stood with the door open listening. I thought I heard something off in the distance  but I thought maybe it was a bull and sounded odd because we lived down in a narrow valley. I stayed in the doorway watching the kids and chatting and heard the sound again and told the kids to come on in  because it was kind of creeping me out. I was feeling on alert but still wasn  t exactly worried. My husband is a prankster and I thought he was trying to scare me.  By now it  s right at sunset and the woods about 100 yards from the house are too dark to see into. I heard the call again and I have never before or again heard a sound like that. By now the kids are freaked out  crying and telling me to come inside  my heart is pounding and I  m thinking- that  s not my husband.... The sound started low and slowly went high  I have no idea how long it went on but the thing that made that sound had to have MASSIVE lungs. It wasn  t a monotone sound. Almost like there were two sets of vocal cords sounding at the same time. A couple of very low sounds  almost like I could feel them in my chest more than I could hear them  and then it yelled again.  It sounded like the call came from the other side of the creek about 150 yards from the house  directly in front. I was more stunned than scared at this point  but my eyes were watering and I did feel strangely sad suddenly  and I had backed all the way up to the door. Right then the guys came back  from the opposite direction of the calls. We told them what we heard and they listened but heard nothing  grabbed some flashlights and ran down to the creek and followed the creek about a quarter mile but didn  t see anything. I didnt hear it again after that but our kids never played outside close to dark after that either. After that we had some stuff moved around or missing. A couple of dogs disappeared and one night it sounded like rythmic tapping on the water pipes in the house in the middle of the night. My husband even crawled under the house to find out what was going on but saw nothing. The next day we saw the pin was pulled on the latch for the well house (by the creek) and the door was standing open. Just odd things like that. We didn  t spend time outside at dusk or night after the August incident. ,The Google maps directions are accurate. The house is still there  but we moved two years after this incident and have not been back. ,Madison,38,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,1089,no
262,I was going home from work. I work nights at a plastics company and went up to the lake that night going home that way. I seen something that looked like a big goat at first. Then I got closer and it stood up in the middle of the road. It was white and taller than the car. I did not see it after I went by  it was gone. This happened at about 3 00 am. It was weird to me. I  ve never seen it again but would like to find it. It makes me very curious. ,Take Arkansas Highway 178 going north from Flippin towards Bull Shoals Lake.

264,On September 8  2022 my son and I packed up to go kayak-camping the Lower Buffalo River. We planned a three night trip as we would take our time as we were fishing. We drove for about 6 or 7 hours and finally arrived. We put in at Rush and only went about four miles that afternoon and just soaked up the beauty. We made camp and enjoyed a peaceful night.  On September 9  2022 we started the day at first light. We knew that we wanted to camp close to Big Creek to keep on schedule  so we fished all day and simply enjoyed the day. By late afternoon it was hot but not too hot. I believe the temp was somewhere around 83-85 degrees and a somewhat clear day with low humidity. At approximately 4 00 pm  I believe we had stopped fishing and were looking for a good campsite as we were getting close to Big Creek. I believe that there was some type of obstruction or a cut to the left where we werenâ€™t paddling but simply letting the river push us. We were quiet and not talking  just quietly floating.  At [36.0931117  -92.4756105] which was to our left  at approximately 20 yards away we heard what can best be described as a pissed off monkey. Literally sounded like a monkey as it ripped away at whatever was in its path as it went away from the river. It was still making the pissed off monkey sounds as it tore through the woods. We both looked surprised and asked what the hell was that as we started paddling away from the location. We joked about the sound and just wanted to put a little distance between us and the pissed off monkey. This occurred just north of Big Creek approximately 1.29 miles.  We paddled about 2.78 river miles from the pissed off monkey and stopped on the river left at a small gravel bar to make camp  at 36.0930645  -92.4567744 The gravel bar wasnâ€™t that wid  and was approximately 15-20 yards long but was in good shade. Our goal this afternoon was to find a good shaded area where we wouldnâ€™t cook as the sun went behind the ridge. Since there was no rain forecast we figured we were good.  Also  the water had been dropping all day. We went into full camp mode and started to get everything set up. Thatâ€™s when we heard the first wood knock. We both stopped what we were doing and looked towards the knock. From our camp it was from the ridge line across the river from us and north up the ridge  a little down river. I looked at my son and said that was a dang wood knock. Now  we joked earlier that the pissed off monkey sound could have been an ole squatch but we were joking. I actually believed my son said that a bear can make some crazy sounds like that when surprised. Regardless  we have now just heard a tree knock  no doubt about that. We both made some sly comments jokingly about it and continued to set up camp. Our camp was on a narrow gravel and rock bar that was approximately 15-20 yards wide. We had a clear field of view up and down the river. Our two tents were set up about 20 feet from the tree line with the tents only being about 12 feet apart. The fire was directly in front of both tents and split the difference from the tents and the water. We had two kayaks pulled completely out of the water to our front right.  Once camp was set we jumped in the river for a little while and knocked the dayâ€™s grime off. After that we walked the rock bar and  fished for a very short time and then gathered enough wood to have a fire that would last us until we hit the sack. We then settled in by a fire and just talked about the day. At approximately 8 00 pm the night started creeping in and I grabbed my weather radio to check the weather since rain was supposed to move in the next day. We sat around and listened to two regional reports and clicked it off. It was immediately after that that all hell would break loose and would last until 4 00 am.  As if from on que  we heard a yell â€œaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhâ€ that came from the ridge line close to where the tree knock was earlier. That freaked us out! We immediately jumped up at the same time and walked towards the water where the campfire smoke wouldnâ€™t block our view. We started looking in the general area and began talking about what the hell would or even could make that noise. We then started asking ourselves if someone could be up on the ridge messing with us. Doubtful based on the location and terrain. We were  after all  in the wilderness. The yell was extremely loud and deep and sounded pissed. It wasnâ€™t no time after that  in fact my son was still standing up  that we heard a noise coming from our rear but it was higher pitched and I couldnâ€™t make it out but it had a melody to it. I stood up and looked at my son and asked what the hell was that? He said  you donâ€™t want to know what I heard. And of course I said I do. He said it sounded like a woman singing. Now that really freaked me out but freaked my son out more because he could actually hear it better. We immediately both went to our tents and retrieved our handguns without a word being spoken. My concern was that now something was on our side of the river and I didnâ€™t like that idea at all.  I immediately began lighting up our camp. I wasnâ€™t sure what was going on but I didnâ€™t have a good feeling about any of it. I had 3 pop up led lanterns  a battery operated canopy string led light  and chemlights. I strung the string light up behind the tents at the woodline  placed one popup lantern between the tents  one to our right and one to our left. The fire was to our front and I tied a Chemlight to a fishing pole on each kayak. Once we had a lighted perimeter set we began gathering all the wood we could possibly gather and settled in listening more than talking.  Between 9 00 - 9 30 pm the first rock of the evening came flying off the ridge and landed in the river to our left -- close to where the first tree knock came from but further towards the front of our position. Iâ€™m not talking about a small rock  I mean cantaloupe size. We both jumped up and walked to the edge of the water with flashlights and pistols. We scanned the ridge but didnâ€™t see anything. It was then that I told my son that this thing is pissed and wants us out of here. We sat back down and discussed our options. We canâ€™t run the Buffalo River at night on a section that weâ€™ve never seen before. We literally donâ€™t know whatâ€™s around the next bend. We have no choice but to hunker down and prepare the best we can. We went and gathered more wood. Once we gathered all that we could we sat down and discussed what we would do. I told my son that he would sleep first but to drag his cot out of his tent and place it between the fire and one of the perimeter lights. He would sleep for 2 hours while I pulled fire watch and then we would swap.  At 10 30 pm my son settled in to sleep as I started my first watch. At approximately 10 45 pm I heard a tree knock that was close to the same location as the first tree knock. However  immediately after the knock  and for the first time since the initial contact  I heard the pissed off monkey sounds. It seemed more ramped up than the first. The pissed off monkey was further down the ridge and to the north but close to the end of the ridge and the river. I then got worried because this thing wasnâ€™t far from the other gravel bar that we could see from camp. It could easily cross the river and come in on a flanking move or come to our rear. At approximately 10 50 pm  immediately across from us and on top of the ridge  I heard a very very deep chatter/mumble vocalization. I immediately recognized the sounds from the Sierra Sounds. Same Samurai sound but seemed deeper. It was at that time that I realized that we were in trouble. With the pissed off monkey making his way down the ridge and the Samurai sounds  my stomach turned. I started doing notes on my phone because I was actually afraid that something was going to happen if we didnâ€™t leave. I figured that we were possibly at our last stand location and the night was not going to end well. I had to make the decision to start doing notes to make sure that someone would read what happened in the event everything went bad. I also did a video of the campsite and how everything was set up  along with my son sleeping. In my gut I felt that we didnâ€™t have a chance in hell. We were trapped with our backs to the river and the ridge. We had no way to get the hell out of there and no way to call for help due to no cellphone service. Continuing with my watch  at approximately 11 45 pm I heard chattering in the same location as the first tree knocks and at 12 30 am my watch ended. I woke my son and gave him all this information. I also advised him to watch our rear because the pissed off monkey may be trying to work his way to our rear. I racked out. My son woke me up for my second watch and passed on his information. He said he heard the pissed off monkey and a rock thrown into the river. Then later he heard a tree knock. He advised that all this took place directly across the river from camp.  At 2 45 am  the last watch began. I had to go out and try to find firewood because we werenâ€™t going to have enough to last through the night. I was able to scavenge some within the wood line but had to make multiple trips due to having only one hand free  the pistol was in the other. At approximately 3 17 am I heard a deep pissed off monkey sound immediately across from camp on the ridge that was immediately followed up with yet another rock thrown into the river. At approximately 3 26 am I heard deep chattering halfway down the ridge that actually scared the hell out of me because it was coming down closer. At approximately 3 32 am I heard a tree snap to my rear. It was the sound of good firewood that you put on your knee and you snap it in half except this sounded like a log that got snapped. I jumped up  pointed my pistol in the general direction and woke my son  he slept through it. I explained to him what just happened and he armed himself. While facing the treeline we slowly backed up to the fire as we scanned the area. I didnâ€™t hear anything run off and best I could tell it was about 20 yards behind the tree line and up the ridge. While backed up to the fire and on guard  I started running through the events that happened while I was on watch. We both came to the realization that things were escalating and we had to do something.  After a brief discussion we decided that we had to do something to show we had intention to leave. We decided that we would start breaking down camp and pack everything into the kayaks. We did just that. It did not take us long at all and before no time the kayaks were loaded and all that was left were our chairs  water bottles and the lighted perimeter. At approximately 4 00 AM we had the fire blazing and sat down. Not long after we sat down my son said did you hear that and I said no but then I heard something that sounded like a laugh. I looked at my son and said what the hell. He said he heard one whistle and pointed to our right and across the river. Then he pointed to our left and said another one was laughing at us from across the river. The whistle I did not hear.  We sat there in our chairs until sunrise with no further activities. Right before first light we began gathering up everything and finalized our packing. As soon as we walked to our kayaks to push them off  a rock came off the ridge  hit a tree on the way down and hit the water in front of us. I shouted we were leaving and we did just that. We paddled about 12 miles straight to the White River where we came out at Rileyâ€™s Outfitters. Neither one of us said a word about this to anyone we encountered at the Outfitters. Needless to say  our trip was cut short but we were good with that. After we returned home I battled with the thought of contacting the Ranger Station at Buffalo Point. I knew that this story was going to sound crazy but I would have felt guilty if I read something later on about a family being hurt on that section of the river and I never said anything. So  on September 11  2022 I started using my law enforcement contacts in an effort to speak directly with a Ranger on the Buffalo. All the information was passed along through a contact and I was advised that I would receive a phone call. That call came a few days later and all the information was passed along. I was advised that an investigation would take place at the coordinates that I released and that I would be contacted if any further information was needed. ,[Investigator (MM) notes  This location is 95 miles north of Little Rock on the Buffalo River.

265,In June  1980  a friend and I were fishing in an ox-bow type lake adjacent to the Mississippi River in Crittenden County  Arkansas  near the town of Hughes  off highway 147. This is just across the river from Memphis  Tennessee  and the area was experiencing was the hottest summer on record at the time.  It is heavily forested  running basically north and south along the river for many miles  and connecting with other river basins emptying into the Mississippi.  My friends   family owned the land surrounding the lake  and theirs   was the only inhabited structure for at least a few miles in any direction.  A small section of one end of the lake had a beach and was used by swimmers and picnicers during the day.  The more distant areas were used only by occasional fisherman. We were in a 16-foot boat a few yards off shore  trolling among the cypress trees in 8-10 feet of water for crappie using minnows as bait  using a quiet electric motor.  It was near sundown  about 8 00 pm. but still light enough to see clearly. The normal lake sounds of birds and insects were interrupted by a crashing noise on the near bank  which was covered in trees and undergrowth.  We initially thought it was either a stray cow or another fisherman walking towards the water.  We were staring into the undergrowth looking for the source of the sounds when a dark  but more or less human-shaped figure appeared between the foliage  2-3 feet from the water  s edge.  It appeared to be covered in black hair and stood upright  facing us.  We could only really see the upper torso and head because of the thick plant growth.  It was difficult to judge the size for the same reason  but we guessed it was near the size of an adult human male or bigger. It caught sight of us and stared for 2-3 seconds  before turning and running into the trees still on two legs  where we quickly lost sight of it.  We heard no vocalizations nor did we smell any odor. The whole episode lasted only 10-15 seconds. We had heard a few reports from others on the lake that summer of seeing large dark-colored animals. We had assumed them to be bears  which are occasionally seen there  and were reported to seek out the lake to cool off in the hottest years.  Also  we had frequently heard howling sounds from the trees around the lake at night  while sitting on the porch of my friends home which sat about 75 yards from the water  s edge in a clearing.  We thought were from panthers or coyotes  but couldn  t remember hearing similar sounds before or after that summer. ,Take I-40 west out of West Memphis  Arkansas.  Exit I-40 south at highway 147.

This road heads east for 2-3 miles  crosses the levee  then goes about another mile before reaching the lake.  The land is all private property  and was sold out of my friends   family several years ago.  I do not know who the current owners are. ,Crittenden,4,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5035,no
266,I  m still wondering if I should be telling this since it  s still hard for me to believe what happened while hiking an old logging road in Cedarville  Arkansas located in Crawford County. My parent  s had just bought a home. We had been in the home for about a year now at this point and I had now a very good knowledge of all the forest area around us. And as a 15 year old boy I loved going out into the wood  s finding deer antler  s and going on hikes up to the old forestry observance tower. This particular Friday I had planned to take my pup tent and a little food with me and go camping like I had done several time  s before. I started my hike with my best friend  Chris H. who was staying over for the weekend to go camping with me. We left the house right after he arrived  around 5pm and we got to where we were going to camp out at around 7pm high up on the mountain which is a long  hard and treacherous hike by any means. We set up out tent and made a nice fire and started to cook hot dogs when I needed to go to the bathroom so I went off into the wood  s to do natures business. Shortly after digging a hole I heard something being thrown through the branches. This happened about 4 or 5 time  s and I thought it was Chris clowning around and I yelled at him to stop throwing stuff at me  I then heard him yell back that he didn  t throw anything to quit playing games that if I throw something again he was going to throw something at me. It didn  t make sence  I wasn  t throwing anything at him  I was pulling my pants back up when I was hit with a stick about an inch in diameter and about a foot long that was freshly  twisted  off of a tree. I got back and had the stick that hit me in my hand because I was going to hit Chris with it since he hit me but he was in his tent and I asked him to come out and he said he wasnt that he was mad at me for throwing stuff at him that he got into the tent so he wouldnt get hit. About that time we heard low  long grunting burping sounds that started out quiet and got louder towards the end of each grunt  I didn  t know what it was but it was getting louder each time  it would make the noise 3 or 4 times and stop and then the sound of something being beaten on with what reminded me of hitting a baseball bat aginst a tree but really hard and then hard thud sounds like it was being hit on the ground and then the grunting would start again. By this time me and Chris were scared  I had a 22 rifle with me that my dad made me always take camping if it were just us kid  s in case of coyotes. I got the 22 out of the tent and Chris got the light and shined it into the wood  s and about 25 yard  s from us we saw a very tall man standing there beside a tree as soon as the light hit his area  he ducked behind the tree but we noticed with the light he was huge  around 7 foot tall at least and was wearing what reminded me of a gillie suite that hunters wear  all covered with a redish brown fur. And the smell that was coming from it was awful. It reminds me of road kill and a wet dog combined together. I didnt even dare using the rifle because I knew that if you shot anything large with a .22 you  re just going to do much to it because even a deer wont drop with a .22 and this person or thing was a lot bigger than a deer or a bear which are in the area. Me and Chris backed up slowly poured water on the fire  we were  still hearing the grunts but not the same sounding grunt  s  these were now more of a growling ooohhhh sound. We finally turned and using the light to keep from breaking out necks ran as fast as we could. I havent been hiking or camping since  don  t ever plan to go again and will not live near any forest areas much less in. We moved from Cedarville 2 years later and I haven  t been back since and won  t be for as long as I live. Me and Chris dont even talk about that night. We both had nightmares for a long time about that night. I know what I heard  smelled and seen and never want to see it again. Now I live in Las Vegas  Nevada and I  m fine without the forest and trees. You will never get me in them again because I know what  s in them. ,Location was 4 miles from home near a old forest watch-tower ,Crawford,18,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5033,yes
267,My name is  T.W. and I live in Arkansas. Before this happened I have never had any thing ever happen to me. This happened in September 2017 at about 11 pm. I am a night owl in the summer because its too hot during the day to do a lot. I had just came from inside my house and walked down steps  my truck was parked to my right and I was going to storage room. As I turned a little to go around the front of my truck something caught my side vision that made me turn my head. As I was turning my head this big human like figure was sprinting so fast It was like 2 seconds and it was gone. It had a dark undercoat and light colored on top hair. I have never in my life seen anything run so fast and what got me was it did not make a sound running past me. It was about 25 to 30 ft away in open area. If I had not caught the glimpse of it I would have never even known he went by me. I can see why they can be around and even around a person and not even know. ,Right beside my house. I would say it had to have been running from across the road  it was just mouth dropping fast with no sound as it went by me and by time I got light to look down a cleared field area it was gone. ,Conway,1,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5029,yes
268,It was about 1 30 am on Sunday  July 29  2001. I was up watching television. My dogs started to bark  so I went to my door to see what was going on. I turned on my porch light  and called my dogs. When my dogs got to the porch  I smelt a strange odor. The air was filled with an odor of raw sewage and rotting meat. I went on out in my yard about 10 feet and looked around. Just over a fence that was about 5 yards from me  I noticed what I thought might be a bear up on two legs. I yelled for it to  get out of here . Then I noticed that instead of walking on all 4 legs  it walked like a human  upright. It was about 8 feet high and long  ape like arms. It had long hair on  his  body. Upon telling my grandmother this  she told me that she had been awakened by a strange deep growl. ,Rural Area. 16 Miles South of rison  in a small community called Herbine (pronounced Her-bean). ,Cleveland,7,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5025,yes
269,In the spring of 1984  I had been working with for the (undisclosed) in Arkadelphia  AR. That particular day we had to paint some boundry line around an area near Biern  AR  just southwest of Gurdon  AR. It was in the afternoon and I had already finished  brushing  out the line for the others to paint the dots on the tree. I knew of an old black man that lived in a little shack not far from there. He ALWAYS had an old loggers helmet on  carried an ole filled 22  and only wore blue overalls and a white shirt. After I had finished  I made my way back to the truck which was on a road that was near the railroad tracks. These tracks went through the middle of Biern. As you pull into Biern from hwy 67  you cross these tracks and then turn right for approx. 2 miles. The road then T  s and can go to the right to cross the tracks again. In 1984  the road only went about another 14 mile before turning back to the right back to 67. Our truck was parked on that last turn that goes back to hwy 67. I had made my way onto the tracks to wait for the others. I wasn  t quite a 14 mile from where the road crosses over the tracks. The signs that let you know of the tracks are maybe 8 ft. high. When I noticed something on the tracks at that cross-over  I noticed that it  appeared  to be another foot taller. That could have been an optical illusion at that distance. I noticed that I could not see the silver hard hat that the old man always wore  or the white shirt  or the gun. This thing  what ever it might have been stopped on the trakcs and turned. But when it turned  it had to turn the whole upper torso as though it had a stiff neck. It was mostly dark in color  it did have some lighter spots on it. It appeared to take a step towards me when another logging companies truck gun it  s motor and startled the creature. It seemed to notice this  turn and take two steps to get into the woods. If you have ever been down the tracks of the railroad  you know that it would be impossible for a normal man to make that kind of distance in only two steps. You have to take into consideration that I was only 18 at the time and still had a pretty vivid imagination. Even with the evidence I had at that time  I questioned what I might have really seen. It wasn  t until later that I found out that there have been many sightings of some creature in that part of the woods. A buddy of mine told me that his grandmother lived in that area and had trouble from a two legged creature getting into her garbage at night. He said that there was only one time that the creature came up on her back porch and look into her window. She said that it looked somewhat like a monkey. She never admitted that she was scared because it never threatened her in any way. This story sort of validated mine. This is not the only time that I have seen a creature out int woods. This occurence happened about 20 to 30 miles away from this. I will try to tell it later. ,Hwy 67 travels beside I-30. This incident occured between Gurdon AR. and Prescott AR. The easiest way to get there is to get off the interstate at the Gurdon exit and travel to hwy 67. Turn Right until you come upon the left turn to Biern. Turn left off of hwy 67  cross the RR tracks and turn right. Travel until you come upon the T in the road or until you are able to cross the tracks on the right again. There on that sight hill where the road crosses the tracks is where the creature stood for a short time. You can then continue on the road that will turn left for approx. another 14 mile to where our truck was. All of this area has changed since the logging started  so take what directions I have given into consideration. ,Clark,23,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5019,yes
270,July 29  2012 my family and I were traveling home from our vacation in Mississippi. We were on a double lane highway in south eastern AR when I saw a tall  large  greyish haired creature standing on his legs  run across the highway about 300 feet in front of my van. It never looked at me  it just ran across the highway. I was so shaken up by what I saw. It was like a human but big and grey haired. , ,Chicot,1,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5017,yes
271,I  ve had two possible bigfoot encounters.  The first occured in 1975 when I seven. The second happened in the summer of 1994.  I had been playing and living at an opera festival seven miles or so west of Eureka Springs in the Ozark mountains.  One night after a runout performance in Missouri several of us were driving back to the festival site.  We were on hwy 62(?) between Beaver Lake and Eureka Springs.  It was after midnight when our carlights illuminated someone or thing standing off of the right (south) side of the road. It raised its hands and covered its face I assume due to the carlights.  We saw no clothes on it and it appeared to be covered in brownish hair.  What we saw didn  t really register at first.  We all thought it was very strange that someone would be out there naked at that time of night.  None of us thought it was a bear because we saw hands (also  I had seen bear in that part of Arkansas and this did not resemble a bear).  We didn  t stop or turn around because we were all a little freaked out. I later realised that this thing had been standing on a small slope.  It must have been 7-8 feet tall.  It wasn  t thick or bulky but appeared thin in comparison to its height. Ever since the first incident I have read and seen everything I could get my hands on concerning bigfoot.  That being said  when I saw what I did in 1994 my first reaction was  who  s stupid enough to be out here at this time of night? They  ll get run over.   Then I realised that it was hair covered and TALL and probably not a man. ,Carrol County between Beaver Lake and Eureka Springs. ,Carroll,15,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5015,yes
272,In late November 2000  my son and I were walking my terrier dog and looking for arrowheads along Beaver Lake. My dog began to follow a large and well defined set of raccoon tracks along the lake shore. The shoreline was larger than usual due to the lack of rain. The morning was sunny with the temperature being about 50 degrees  sweat shirt weather. The raccoon tracks proceeded about 20 yards away from the water  to an area of great disturbance in the packed sandy soil. Disturbance as in some type of scuffle. The raccoon tracks intersected with two sets of human like footprints which had come from a nearby wood line. From the disturbance site  the human type tracks returned to the wood line  but the raccoon tracks ceased to exist. We did not have a camera or tape measure  but one set of tracks were 16-17 inches long and about 5 to 6 inches across at the ball of the foot. The smaller set  which ran parallel to the larger  were about 11 inches in length and maybe 4 to 5 inches at the ball. The larger set were impressed in the soil about 4 inches and the smaller pair only a couple of inches. These tracks were very flat in appearance as well. I weigh 130 lbs and my son 180 lbs  we left only faint impressions in the same soil. We attempted to follow these tracks back the way they had come  but we lost sight of them in the forest as the ground was much firmer and covered with leaves etc. One final note  my terrier dog was whining and acting very unusual  defecating and urinating on the disturbance site  then attempting to cover the location with sand and dirt. ,Highway 264  north of Hickory Creek Marina  south of White River on Beaver Lake  Arkansas. ,Benton,9,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5007,no
273,I was standing about 10 feet down in the forest around a deep ravine not really too far from the house but it was right next to a patch of woods going back further south into the national forest. (The narrow patch of woods then stretched on northward.) Leaves were on the ground. That was the first thing that impinged on my consciousness -- the sound of something walking through leaves. It was a measured long tread  I could tell. I started really looking around trying to see what was making those sounds. (I was much braver back then.) Then over on the other side of the ravine close to the bottom but definitely walking uphill  I saw it. For all of about three seconds  seemed like longer at the time  and about 50-100 yards away. It was very large and I could see that it was hairy. I could see the ground between it  s moving legs  and some vague image of arms  but not the head. Some forest branch obscured my view of the very top part of the body. I could tell it was walking upright uphill. It wasn  t a bear; it was striding with a purpose up the hill on the other side. It was quickly out of sight. Now I know I wasn  t thinking clearly  because I decided I had to try to get a better look at it. So I ran as quickly as I could around the rim of the ravine  since it  s origins began in our front yard (not the best playground I can tell you). Anyway  it didn  t take me long to reach the other side and move down into the woods slightly to look around and see if I could find it again. I did not see it again. I was there for only a minute or so when it suddenly occurred to me that I didn  t hear anything anymore at all  no sound  no birds  no nothing  and fear like I  d never known before hit me and I went running practically screaming back to the house for mother. I told her what I  d seen and she  of course  did not believe me  though she told me to never tell anyone else the story. For a long time I didn  t tell anyone  except family members  but they didn  t believe. It didn  t help that only one or two people since then truly believe that I saw a BigFoot. Since then I have lots of trouble going out alone in the woods. While no one actually calls you a liar  they look skeptical and you can tell they either think you  d been drinking/drugging or saw a bear. ,Approximately 10 miles south of Mountain Home AR.

274,When I was about 13 years old I went trout fishing with my mother and aunt on the White river in Arkansas.  We were staying at a motel in BullShoals.  One morning we drove to a remote area of the river to fish via an unkown dirt road.  We stopped to fish a bend of the river.  On the opposite side of the river(west)  was a tall stone bluff with a slight over crop from erosion.  On the east side was flatter land with 12 to 20 foot thin scrub trees about 20 to 30 feet from the water  as the river was low.  While my mother and aunt where fishing off the bank  I decided to try my luck further up river  about 300 yards away and just out of sight with my mother.  While I was fishing along the bank I began to hear rustling sounds in the trees and shrubs behind me.  I looked in the direction of the noise and could see the tops of the these thin trees moving as if something were walking through them and pushing them to the side  but due to the thickness of the vegetation I could not see what was actually moving the trees.  I stood and observed this activity for 2 or 3 minutes.  I began hearing grunting type sounds that were very deep and substantial sounding.  These sounds were similar but different than grunt sounds a bull would make.  The movement of the trees began to appear as if something were shaking the trees at this point instead of moving through them.  It appeared that whatever was making the noises was only about 10 feet inside the brush yet I could not see what it was.  Feeling nervous  I decided I should return to my mothers side and began walking back towards my mother.  As I did  whatever was in the brush moved with me step for step.  As I walked the movement in the trees seemed more forceful with the sounds of large branches breaking as it moved.  When I got within sight of my mother (about 50 yards)  all activity stopped.  I informed my mother there was something in the brush following me  but she shrugged it off.  Within a few minutes we decided to leave as we werent catching any fish. ,I was only 13 at the time and didnt pay much attention to the roads.  The dirt road came down around a hill and leveled off along the east bank of the river.  The other side of the river was inaccessible due to a very steep bluff.  The bottom of the bluff was exposed rock with a slight outcropping from erosion.  About 50 feet up the bluff vegitation began with ever increasing pine trees and vegetation that continued at least another 200 plus yards to the top.  This part of the river was on a long gradual bend that obstructed lengthy views along the river in either direction.  I have fished the river many times as an adult but have yet to find the exact spot. ,Baxter,6,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5005,yes
275,While driving to check on my dogs that were being kept at my aunts house in a fenced in area with a ten by ten out building. An adolescent bigfoot ran out of the woods and into my aunts yard it ran between the house and the garage. It was approximately three and a half to four foot tall. I pulled in to the drive but was to afraid to get out of the car had the feeling that something was watching me from the woods. The dogs were yapping but ok so I left because I was afraid. ,Go down highway 5 north to Connie dr just at the outskirts of town. ,Baxter,6,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5005,yes
276,I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING.  I DID HEAR A LOT.  WHILE IN A BOAT FISHING WITH TWO FRIENDS WE WERE ALONG THE SHORE LINE JOKING AROUND AND TRYING TO CATCH SOMETHING WHEN WE HEARD A VERY LARGE ANIMAL RUSTLING IN THE WOODS.  THE ANIMAL/OBJECT WAS NOT ALL THAT FAR FROM US BUT WE COULD NOT SEE DUE TO THE DENSE VEGITATION AND THE LOW LIGHT CONDITION.  THE CREATURE DID SOUND TO BE VERY LARGE AND THE THRASHING OF THE VEGITATION BECAME LOUDER.  THE THREE OF US IN THE BOAT DID BEGIN TO SPECULATE WHAT WE WERE HEARING AND NONE OF US WERE WORRIED UNTIL WE HEARD THE SHRILL FROM THIS ANIMAL.  IT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS VERY LOUD  BONE CHILLING AND IN DID STRIKE FEAR IN ALL OF US.  WE BEGAN TO PULL OUR LINES AND START THE BOAT ASAP TO LEAVE THE AREA AND THE ANIMAL BEGAN TO RUN AWAY FROM OUR LOCATION.  I THINK THE DIRECTION WAS S/E.  WE STILL COULD HEAR THE ANIMAL MOVING THROUGH THE DENSE VEGITATION AT A FAST FACE WITH NO APPARENT PROBLEM.  THE ANIMAL CONTINUED TO SHRILL ON OCCASION STOPP ING APPROX. EVERY 200YDS.  THE DISTANCE THE FINAL SHRILL WAS HEARD AT WAS APPROX. 1/4 TO 1/2 A MILE AWAY THROUGH DENSE WOODS  UP HILL.  THE TIME FRAME WHICH THIS TOOK PLACE IN WAS SO FAST WE WERE UNABLE TO THINK OF AN ANIMAL WHICH COULD SOUND SO LARGE  HAVE SUCH A DEEP SHRILL  AND MOVE SO FAST.  THE SHRILL WAS NOT AS ANY OTHER ANIMAL I HAVE EVER HEARD NOR WAS IT TO THE TWO OTHER PEOPLE I WAS WITH.  THE SHRILL WAS LATER HEARD BY BE APPROX. 2YRS LATER WHILE ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK IN WI.

Coming home from fishing as we rounded the 30 mph curve right before the stop sign we were headed south on 101 an animal walking upright came into clear view as  he  was in my high beams and was on the west side shoulder. My buddy Joe who was with me and I said not a word to one another. We were now at maybe 20 mph as we watched this big critter who was standing upright take one step and went from the far side of the shoulder to the center line. Where  he  paused for a moment  looked us up and down altho we felt no fear from it Joe and I each felt like  he  looked at each one of us  me first then Joe. before turning his head straight . Then he leaned forward and put his knuckles on the pavement and swung his hips through his arms and was now on the far side of the east shoulder.

278,I had been visiting a friend one night. It had gotten late and I had to work in the morning  so I got in my car to leave. On my way back to the main road  I stopped at a stop sign. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving in the trees. I looked over and an upright figure came out of the woods towards my car. I would estimate it was 7   to 7  5  tall with dark brown hair with grey patches on the chest and face. I drove away  quickly  because it was coming towards my door. As I drove  in the rear view mirror I saw it cross the road in about 2 steps  then I lost sight of it. ,State highway #62 east from Mountain Home for about two miles  then left (north) on Mallard Point Road  for about about one mile to its intersection with Ridgecrest Drive.

279,Well i live in bentonville Akansas right now  my dad own his own buisness. One Day we got on the subject i was telling him that i had bought a little book of ghost stories and bigfoot sightings and how i was very  itrested in bigfoot. Then he told me that he seen bigfoot before and he told me the whole story. At fist i didnt belive him  but a couple of years later he told me the same story when we got on the topic again. The story is that he was riding ATVs with his friends around or in ether lost bridge lake of bever lake and he was at the front of the group of 4-wheelers and they were going down this hill that led to a dirt road. Since he was in front of the group he went down first and got on the dirt road and stopped to wait for the rest of the group to come down. before they came down he lokked over across the dirt road on the other side of the hill on the tree line where the evevning sun was shining through the trees and seen the big foot walking. He said it was taking really big steps and apered to be 7-8 feet tall. He couldnt se the color because the sun was shining through the trees and big foot so you know it apeared as a shadow. Then the rest of the group came down and he told them what he saw and they didnt belive him. Thats all he told me. He told me he coudnt remeber every detale. But he still knows more than me  i cant remeber everything. The reason i  m telling you and not him is that i probably coudn  t get him to get on here to tell you this. I  m telling you this because im learnig about bigfoot in our biology class at bentonville high school. my teacher is a marine biologist and a cytozoologist. We watched the big foot movie and the legend of boggy creek in class. Plus the sightings in Decator which is write by our town. So all this bigfoot stuff is making me so excited to dicover the bigfoot and do my part in adding another unreported sighting  since i know theres got to be alot of them out there. If you need any more info i dont have a phone but you can write me at (Withheld)  my name is (withheld) or you can call my dad who was the one who seen it at (withheld) , ,Benton,9,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5007,yes
280,In early to mid October of 1981 I was 17 years old. I was working weekends in Fayetteville  a town 28 miles from where I lived in Siloam Springs. I usualy left for work around 5 30am.I would drive the old highway #68 towards Fayetteville-Springdale. One morning I was on my way to work and as I was coming close to where Fairmount road was I could see something by the bridge at first I thought it was a coyote or large dog scratching around the bridge with its back legs as I got closer I realized it was not and that it was a sasquatch  it was a reddish-brown color  I could see its face area had almost no hair and the skin tone was lighter than the rest of it. It looked up at me as I passed on over the bridge  my car was a vw bug and the lights were not very bright  it seemed to be startled. I lokked into the rearview mirror to see it jump up and run across the road. It moved in long strides and very quickly. It was tall maybe close to 7 feet and was thinner than I would have expected it to be. The activity it seemed to be doing when I first saw it was digging at the ground next to the bridge the motion it was using was similar to what primates do  the manner in which it moved across the road was however more like a human would move. ,Fairmount bridge ,Benton,9,Arkansas ,AR,Fall ,5007,yes
281,I have no doubt about what we saw. It was springtime in 1997. Me  my dad and brother in law was fishing in a boat by Holiday Island  AR in a cove called the Leatherwood Creek. We were trolling along the bank and at about 9 am along an area that opened up from the trees to a rocky area that was a power line clearing when we seen a Bigfoot like creature walking upright over fairly big rocks towards the power line. He was hairy  walked kind of slumped  arms seemed to be long  everything you would think about Bigfoot. The only thing is didnâ€™t seem to me to be like 6-7 ft tall  more like 5 ft but could of been the angle and distance  guessing 50 yds. Donâ€™t remember face in a descriptive way other than struck me as a kind of demonic look. We floated by fairly quickly but had time to witness this. When we cleared view of it I asked my dad and brother in law if they seen what I did and they said yes. We were in shock and dumb founded. My dad died in 2005 and me and my brother in law has brought it up a couple times since then. , ,Carroll,15,Arkansas ,AR,Spring ,5015,yes
282,Five of us were sitting in a boat in the middle of Beaver Lake about 11 00 PM.  It was just before I moved away from the area  so we were getting together at our friend  s lake cabin one last time before I left.  We were all talking and some coyotes started to yip and howl.  After about approximately ten seconds of this  we heard a low gutteral howl.  This howl was much lower and longer than the coyotes.  I said   did you hear that?  and about that time this sound repeated two or three more times in succession.  Two of the guys dismissed these as howls of a Husky breed of dog.  One of these two owned a Husky in the past.  However  this sound was much deeper than the sound I heard his dog or the coyotes make.  It was almost exactly the same as the vocalizations I listened to on your website.  It was not the screeching vocalizations.  All the sounds appeared to be several hundred yards away.  After that  no more sounds were heard.  Neither the coyotes nor the other sound.  I believe these were sounds from a Bigfoot.  I did not tell of my suspitions  for I have only revealed my beliefs to the guy who owned the Husky.  I felt as though the others may not believe me or make fun of the situation.  It took me a while to get to sleep that night knowing that a Bigfoot may be in the area. ,Off Hwy 23 about 8 to 10 miles.

283,I saw a very tall creature in one of our pastures. It had a medium brown fur coat  but its face was not furry. It made a very loud noise which my neighbors also heard and called our house right after it happened. Thay didn  t see the  beast  though. The creature stood about 7.5 ft. tall and was very stoutish. ,It happened outside of Arkadelphia  Arkansas. (Clark County) ,Clark,23,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5019,yes
284,I was driving down the road and needed to use the restroom.  I stopped my vehicle and turned my lights and the motor off so I could hear if any other vehicles were coming.  I smelled a very strong odor coming from the road in front of me.  It smelled a lot like a wild hog.  I turned the headlights on and standing approximately 30 yards in front of me was a large hairy creature 7 to 8 feet tall.  It had large eyes and a large mouth and it  s hair was very long and shaggy and very dirty.  It had it  s arms out to it  s side like it was surprised that I turned the lights on.  It  s arms were very long  longer than that of a human.  It stood there for a few minutes and then took two long strides into the woods.  I did not look for tracks that night  but came back the next day and did not see any  but the gravel road is very hard and there was pine straw on both sides of the road in the woods. ,Directions removed ,Cleveland,7,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5025,yes
285,The report  as written by the witness   hello not sure if this report is worth anything but in the fall of 1983 me and may dad had made a hunting trip for turkey as we did every year. we got to the woods which border the mississippi river and parked it was bout 4.00am. we started toward the woods in pitch dark without flashlights and as we got half way to the woods this god awful scream came out of no where. it was if what ever it was seemsd like it was just in front of us. my dad at the time was 68 yrs old and had been in the woods all of his life. he ha never shown fear in all of our years hunting but at that time he was visabally scared as i was. i wanted to turn and go back to the truck parked under a light next to the sun gas line terminal which was bout a 100 yard back. but then we heard the scream again. it seemed like a baby crying and woman screaming all together at the same time. well i could tell my dad wa scared and we made it tp the edge of the woods and we set tite till the sun came up. then we mooved down the woods for bout a 1/2 mile and heard the screams 3 more times it seemd like it was shadowing us down the bottom. well i saw my dad that day jump a 4 wire barbed wire fench and we got to the truck and we havent been back there since. which we always you to hunt turkey and run our beagles back there. cant say for sure what it was as we never saw any sign or tracks but my dad stated in all of his years in the woods he ha never heard such a sound. this happened in west memphis ark at the foot of 8th street landing  ,8th street landing behind the police shooting range. a boottom land behind the levee ,Crittenden,4,Arkansas ,AR,Winter ,5035,no
286,My encounter happened in June of 2006 outside of West Memphis  AR between 4 00 and 5 00 pm. My then seven-year-old son and I were driving in my truck one afternoon to go feed our horses which we kept at my cousins home who live about twenty-five miles outside of town. We had decided to take a shortcut and get off of the paved county road and turn onto a small gravel road that ran beside a railroad track for about ten miles. There is a large frozen food warehouse on the corner of the county road and the gravel road but nothing else around. After we had passed the warehouse is when the creature leaped across the road in front of my truck. It happened very quickly. It cleared the road entirely in one leap and never touched the gravel road. It came from my right to my left and I nearly hit the creature with my truck before I could stop. I came within approximately two feet of it with the front of my vehicle. As I said before it was in mid-air when we first saw it. The creature appeared to be around four feet in height may be slightly taller and was covered in reddish-brown hair all over that was about four to six inches in length. It was like hair not fur because it was thin and flowing in the wind unlike what fur would do. The creature was lean and somewhat muscular and it  s arms seemed to be disproportionately long for its size. If I had to compare it to something I would have to say it looked similar to an orangutan but I  m sure there were no orangutans on the loose that day in eastern Arkansas. I  m not sure what it was but I am certain of what it was not. It was not a dog  coyote  deer  bear or anything that I  ve seen before except for some sort of ape. My son said   Dad did you see that?  I said   Yeah I did son.  He said   What was that a monkey?  I laughingly said  in order to comfort him   I don  t know. It was either that or a baby bigfoot.  When the creature landed across the road there was some very tall grass for several feet and beyond that the train tracks and beyond that thousands of acres of farmland with several patches of woods everywhere. When it hit the ground it took one step into the grass and then the creature just seemed to disappear. I stopped my vehicle and waited for a few minutes in hopes of seeing it again but we never did. And just like that  it was gone. It disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. For years now I have often thought about the incident and just exactly what it was that we saw that afternoon. I believe that it was a young sasquatch and it had been dumpster diving behind that frozen food warehouse  though I can  t be certain. I  ve often wondered if there was an adult one nearby that we never saw. Because of that  I  m really glad now that I didn  t get out and pursue it which had crossed my mind to do at the time. Well  that  s my story and you can choose to believe me or not it makes no difference to me but I know what I saw and I can tell you that it  s real  there really is some unknown bipedal creature or ape or whatever out there and we were just lucky enough to see one. They  re real! , ,Crittenden,4,Arkansas ,AR,Summer ,5035,yes
287,In 1959 a friend and I went deer hunting in the hills above Marysville  California. At the time Beale Air Force Base was closed so we went on the base in the mountains. We camped out in the old barracks area that first night. My friend had his two retiever dogs with him. It was dark and we were in our bed rolls. We heard a very loud yelling - almost a scream - coming from the woods about a hundred yards away. The dogs went crazy and headed towards the wooded area. My friend and I grabbed our rifles and followed them. I have never heard a sound like that before. Just as we got a short distance away from the woods  we seen something that the dogs were running around. It was on two feet. It grabbed one dog  threw it some distance and swung on the other dog. I had it in the flashlight beam but couldn  t see it too well. It turned towards us and my friend said that it had a face like that of an ape. It bounded into the trees and the dogs were called off by him. We did not stay there that night. About 6 years ago they had a program on TV that had recorded the noise believed to be Bigfoot. It was the same sound completely that we heard. At the time of this  I was stationed at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield  California. A year later I was stationed there at Beale. ,Beale is an active Air Force Base now and has changed a lot. The area we were in was about three miles North East of the main part of the base. There were barracks there when the army had it for training. It was called Camp Beale and had some 80 000 acres. The army abandoned the camp many years before this took place. The Air Force reopened it in 1960. Go towards the mountains on base untill you see the thick forest area. I don  t know if the barracks are still there or not. Likely not. ,Yuba,1,California ,CA,Fall ,6115,no
288,This happened when I was 12 years old  so that had to be in 1950. I was camping in Los Padres National Forest. I was riding along a hill following a trail down to water in the Sespy River. About 50 yards from the streem  I saw 3 Big Foots geting a drink. I knew bears and monkeys but this was something I had never seen before. I just sat still on my horse and when they saw me  I raised my hand as if to say hi. The largest one raised her hand and in a little while  she took each of the 2 little ones by the hand and walked up the trail. I waited a little while so as not to scare them then rode on down to the streem to give my horse a drink. The big one was about the size of a teenager. I think she was baby siting the 2 little ones. They all had redish brown hair but not on their faces or hands. The teanage one had the begenning of brests. They did not seem to be afraid of me in any way. When my horse finished drinking  I rode on up the trail but didn  t see any sign of them. This is all true. I have told a few people but they said I was lying. Thats why I have never told this until now. I think people should leve the alone  but know they won  t. ,It is about 4 hours horseback past Piedra Blanka ,Ventura,3,California ,CA,Summer ,6111,yes
289,This incident occurred in the fall of the year  in Tulare county  Ca. The year was approximately 1955  plus or minus one year. I was about eleven years old  and on a boy scout camping trip. Although this happened to me a long time back  I now can remember it clearly. I say now because for along time I blocked it out of my mind. Sometime in the early morning hours I left the tent to visit the latrine  which was maybe fifty yards away at the edge of a small ravine. As I was standing there relieving myself I began to hear small limbs and heavy brush breaking just on the other side of the ravine. My first thought was that a steer or cow was over there  and I quickly directed my flashlight beam in the direction of the sounds. What I saw Froze me in terror. It looked to be about seven maybe eight feet tall  covered with long shaggy brown hair and kind of teetering back and forth on it  s two feet. The head was very large with no neck to be seen  and the eyes about ten to twelve inches apart with round glowing orange appearance. The arms were very long  and hung straight down. I turned and ran back to the tent  wetting myself all the way. Everyone that I tried to relate this incident to just laughed at me  including my own family. Finally I just told myself that it didn  t really happen. Thats how I left it untill one day a few years ago I picked up  The Bigfoot Case History Book   and while paging through it  suddenly there was the picture of what I saw so many years ago. Not ape like at all  but what they referr to as the diving helmet type. ,The area was a large cattle ranch made available to the scouts to camp on. ,Tulare,19,California ,CA,Fall ,6107,yes
290,My parents and I used to go deer hunting every deer season  (usually the 1st. of November) up around Payne  s Creek  Ca.  We always went with my girlfriend Darla  s family. It was a lot of fun.  My friend Darla and I would go for long walks in the woods.  We loved to see how many animals we could find.  We  d see everything from chipmunks to rattlesnakes.  We saw a lot of deer  too.  Probably more than our fathers ever saw.  We usually walked up an old logging road for a couple of miles and then we would turn around and go back to camp. One time  I think the year was around 1968 or 69  we had invited another friend  Shirley  to come camping with us.  All three of us girls were in our early teens.  Darla and I decided to take Shirley out and show her where we always took our walks.  We walked and talked for along time.  Seeing all kinds of animals along the way. We were laughing and just having a good old time  like teenage girls do. We ended up walking a little farther than we normally did.  Then we decided to go off the road and walk down the hill a little bit.  We came to a creek and we started walking on the rocks to cross it.  The creek was about 8 to 10 feet wide  so it took several steps to get across. After we got across  we saw on one of the rocks  a big red lizard.  None of us had ever seen a lizard like that before.  It kind of scared us  so we thought we  d better start heading back.  That was when we saw two hunters walking up the hill  the same way we were going.  We stopped and let them go ahead of us.  They said hello  and went on up. Because we had walked so far  we started to feel like we were lost.Then we really started getting scared. I  ve always had a good since of direction  but I was getting a little worried  too.  Then I remembered that we had walked up and down two hills and when we got to the top of the third hill  we then walked down the north side of the hill to the creek.  I reassured my friends that I knew exactly where we were and that we would find our way back just fine. That was when I saw it.  I didn  t know what it was  I had never seen anything like it before.  It came down the hill about fifty feet to the left of where the two hunters had just gone up.  It stood two feet taller than the men we had just seen.  It  s whole body was dark brown  like it was covered with fur.  At first I thought it was a bear  but It didn  t walk like a bear.  It walked like a man  upright and swinging it  s long arms.  I remember the top of it  s head looked flat like it had a top hat on  the kind that Abraham Lincoln would have worn.  It moved quickly and quietly and in no time at all  it had come down the hill and crossed the creek.  The same creek we had taken several steps to cross  it crossed with just one step.  It disappeared into the trees so fast  that I was the only one to see him.  I was so shocked that I couldn  t say anything.  I just stood there with my mouth hanging open until he was gone.  But I never felt afraid the whole time. When we got back to camp  my dad had just came back to camp from hunting all morning.  I told him all about what I had seen and he said that he had been on the other side of the creek around the same time that we were there  which was around 12 00 PM.  He said that he didn  t see anything but he heard a loud sound like a large wounded animal breathing real heavy.  The same sound that he had heard several years before on another hunting trip at a place called Brush Creek.  Then he made the sound for me.  It gave me chills.  It sounded asthmatic  like loud moaning breathes.  He admitted to me that he was very afraid both times he had heard it  even though he was standing there with a deer rifle in his hands. A few years later  my family and I were watching T V and a program came on about Bigfoot.  It was suppose to have actual footage of a real Big foot.  I had heard of the legend of Bigfoot  but I always thought that it was just that  a legend.  When I saw the footage   I got those same chills all over again.  I jumped up and yelled  That  s it  that  s what I saw!   It looked just like what I had seen  except they said that the one on T V was a female because it had breasts.  The one I saw didn  t and it looked taller  too  so I  m guessing it must have been a male. It  s been over 30 years since I saw whatever it was I saw  and I can still see it as clearly in my mind as I did then.  Whenever I tell this story to friends  they always laugh and joke around with me like I  m making it up or crazy or something.  I just tell them   You don  t have to believe me.  I don  t know what it was I saw that day either  but I do know that I saw... something!  ,After reaching Payne  s creek  my father would drive even farther.  It was usually late at night when we would finaly arrive and I was usually asleep. ,Tehama,5,California ,CA,Fall ,6103,yes
291,Iâ€™m 42 now and its been a while since I decided to tell my story about what I saw that beautiful sunny day about 11 00am if you go down to the Pasquines restaurant  take rear turn-off road and keep going till you see a road turning to the right. I lived at the house by the levee in my childhood years 1965-1968. Immigrants had a shack against the levee and always had a gather for the weekend. One day my Mom was out to show the Men how she could shoot her New 22 Ruger rifle at the tin cans. After all the fun  a man was just having an idea if he could just use the rifle on Saturday morning for cottontails  Dad and Mom was happy to let him use it !  Saturday came around and I noticed the home made rack with  cottontail and Jack Rabbit hanging upside down near the small cabins to the side of them. My brother told me to go with him and check them out! it was sad to see such a kill. That evening the men showed my Dad how beer batter makes a good rabbit roast over the fire  and we all had a share of the food with wild rice and flour tortillas. This went on for two weeks  then a problem occurred! Someone was stealing the rabbits from the rack ! Since our family was the only one in the camp  we where most likely the blame. My Dad was beat-up at a card game as beer caused a climax over the rabbit issue  and I could not stand to see it. I was not afraid of anything cause I never watched any TV in my life about scary stuff  so I had no feeling for that in that direction. I went up the levee to just to look around and I saw a rat-snake. I ran down and told Mom about the snake  Mom said not to go back up again. it could bite me!. but my curious mind took me back up the next day. I walked up the levee looking down to the right side where I may have seen it last. When I got to the top   that was it... No snake. Then in the silence of everything but the soft breeze blowing a bit in my ear  I saw something moving in front of me. this huge Monkey like creature on a cottonwood tree  looking over the levee. I noticed it in the shade of the upper branches because one of its legs was swinging back and forth below the branch. I got closer to adjust my focus on this big creature and sure enough it was some sort of ape like thing but with a smaller head and it had human like features. I looked down to see if there was a fence between us  and there was not any fence at all ! My mouth was watering over fear and I could not move my legs. I found a way to turn around and get off the levee! As I went down the levee  half way down I started to run and never looked back. I told my Mom about what I saw and she stopped cleaning and told me to just shut and lock the doors. My Mom was now thinking of the rabbits that had gone missing and told me food left-out makes animals gather for more. We never went over that levee again . Fear after that was something to remember when alone at that age. We moved almost a few years later due to the Juan Corona murders on the same farm  and never spoke about the huge monkey by the levee again. ,if you are coming from Yuba City go to Live Oak Hwy and as you get to the famous Pasquines restaurant turn off that back road   the first road to the right is it! I dont know the name of it but its very simple. Go all the way to the back up the road ramp on the levee. When you stand on top of the levee look to the left and about 50 yards there used to be cottonwood trees higher than the levee. They may still be there. ,Sutter,1,California ,CA,Summer ,6101,yes

293,This was at a youth camp. There were 20 kids all about 16 to 18 years in age. There were two dorms  one going out to the east and one going to the south  with a living area and kitchen in the middle. Each dorm was open to the middle. There were two large windows at the end of the dorm with a door in the middle. I was in the dorm to the south sitting on my bed. There were three kids still up in my dorm. It was about 9 30 or so at night; we were getting ready for bed. About 10 of us were still up. I heard the kids in the east dorm start to yell and say someone is walking around outside. I heard the counselors say that there was no one outside and go to bed. So I didn  t think much of it. A few minutes later they started to yell again. The counselors got mad at the kids for yelling and turned out their dorm lights. I thought they were just goofing off because we were a good 10 miles from town and no one would just be out there walking around. About 2 or 3 minutes went by when a movement caught my eye out the window . I was about 12 feet from the windows. I looked out the far window from my bed and I saw what looked like someone at the garbage dumpster. There was a big light but it was hard to see. I kept looking but didn  t say anything. I didn  t want to get in trouble if it was nothing. It started to walk to the end of the dorm and I lost sight of it because of the door in the middle. I was trying to look around the door from my bed when it looked in the window from the other side of the door. It was bent down looking in the window and I was looking out the window. I was 12 feet away. We looked at each other for about 20 to 30 sec. which seemed like a long time. I could see it was holding stuff in it  s left arm and it had brown eyes and kind of a big nose. Well I got scared and dove under my blankets and when I came back up it was gone. I think 7 to 10 kids seen it maybe not as good as me. I  m not sure. No one said much about it. It didn  t try to hurt anyone or seem threatening when I got scared  but I was a kid of 16. ,Sonoma County  California.

294,My Name is Margaret Whitney...1944.. I was 9 yrs. My brother was 8. We lived in N. Ca.  Just off the Klamath river  on McKinney Creek.  We were walking on a dirt road.. passing a clearing.  across the clearing about 50 yds  we saw three strange animals.  It was like looking at PaPa bear  MaMa bear and baby bear. From where we were..They seemed to have long necks.  There arms hung down almost to the ground. We stood and looked at them. They looked back at us. My brother and I kept asking each other  what are they ?  They turned and walked back into the woods.. we ran home to tell our Mother...She insisted that we saw sheep.  We know they were not sheep.  Later years..when Big Foot  was reported... I know that is what we saw. ,Leave North from Yreka to the Klamath River. Follow the river  East... to Horse Creek.

296,During the summer of 1974 my sister in law I am were on our way from Lompoc  California to see our respective grandmothers. My sister in law  s grandmother lived in Buttonwillow which is in Kern County  and my grandmother lived in Porterville  which is in Tulare County. It had just grown dark by the time we were about five miles outside of Paso Robles still in San Luis Obispo County on Highway 46 heading toward Shandon  and had just passed a lone farmhouse to our left when I had to pull to a quick stop. Just in front of us stooped down in the road and holding a chicken to its mouth was a creature about the size of a 12 year old. It stood up on two legs and ran quickly past us to the left of my vehicle  still holding the chicken. We turned to watch it veer off to our right behind us and up over an embankment. I asked my sister in law   Did you see that?  She did. I don  t know what I was thinking cause I then said to her   Let  s catch it!  and turned the car around. Then I immediately thought better of it  as it was obviously a young Big Foot  and I was afraid it  s parents might be close by as well and with as fast as that creature ran  who knew the strength of its parents. This creature was covered with long dark brown hair except for its face and region around its belly button  and it was obvious that it was a boy. It had a flat face and a broad nose  and its teeth looked like it could use a good orthodontist. ,This area has since been built up and is now part of the City of Paso Robles. I believe vineyards are now about where the farm house was. ,San Luis Obispo,1,California ,CA,Summer ,6079,yes
297,While in infantry training at Camp Pendleton in California we had dug in on a very large hill and were expecting a enemy force to attack in the night. I had one Marine with me and to our left were two other about 30 yrds. away. They were also dug in. We had a steep rock covered area right in front of us. We heard something coming up the side of the mountain. We could hear rocks rolling down the mountain. It came up over the edge and the Marine with me yelled halt. It stood up right in front of us about 6 feet away. I could see the outline of this creature and it was hugh. It looked about 3 1/2 feet wide. It had long arms and a pointed head. It was very tall. From the hole we were in I had to look almost straight up at it. I couldn  t believe how big it was! It was sotall big and wide. I could see the outline very well but could not make out its features. It made no noise and there was no smell we could detect. It stood there for about one minute and then walked between us and the other Marines. I was terrified at the time and my hair was standing up. I tried not to breath. I had no idea what to expect from it. After it had passed and was out of sight the four of us made sure we had all seen the same thing. Everyone said they were not going to say a thing. I have never before reported this but now I know they exist. My father worked for the Green Lake county Sheriff  s department back in the 1970  s. During deer hunting some hunters had seen a bigfoot near Manchester Wisconsin. The sheriff  s department sent people out with snowmobiles to try and track it. They never found it but had numerous pictures of the tracks in the snow. My dad showed me the pictures they had up on a bulletin board in their meeting room. ,I only know we were up in some small mountains or large hills(whatever you want to call them). We were somewhere in Camp Pendleton. Not sure of where. They took us out in trucks and then we walked to the location. ,San Diego,9,California ,CA,Fall ,6073,yes
298, The Zoobies  -- 1992 interview with Sgt. Doug Huse  San Diego County Sheriffs Department MONEYMAKER  Okay  just go ahead and tell me about yourself  when you started working there and so on. HUSE  I started working the Alpine area (east of San Diego  California) in March of 1970. I came to the department the previous year. I was working out there in a patrol capacity for the San Diego County Sheriff  s Department I was a deputy at the time and actually worked Alpine for about 2 years  from March of 1970 to April of 1972. As far as trying to recall exactly when this went down  the best I can come up with is that it was after the Laguna fire of 1970 ... September of 1970. MONEYMAKER  The Laguna fire affected which areas? HUSE  Well  it was the largest brush fire at the time in California history  and burned specifically in the Sweetwater River area from east of Alpine all the way south and west  probably another 15 miles. It was quite an extensive burn and through the area in question  Alpine  on the south side of Interstate 8. To recall the chain of events  it was extremely cold which means the time of year would  ve been sometime after September of 1970  probably December or January  maybe February...let  s see  that would be 1971 ... well  it was definitely winter. MONEYMAKER  Was that about the time of your first contact with the key witness  Dr. Baddour (prominent San Diego psychiatrist)? HUSE  Yes  and I don  t recall the reason  but Dr. Baddour was stopped by a two-man patrol unit. Baddour was traveling eastbound  which would  ve been from the San Diego area to what we learned later was his home in Alpine. On the front seat of his car  I don  t remember what kind of car it was  he had a loaded .44 magnum revolver with a 6-inch barrel. That  s the same type of gun that Dirty Harry made famous. It  s the largest caliber hand gun you can buy. Of course this piqued our interest a little bit. I wasn  t the contact  I was what we call the cover during this particular stop. My partner  s the one who made first contact and found the gun. He secured the revolver and was asking the doctor  who  d identified himself as Dr. Baddour  why he was carrying the weapon. Baddour said it was because of a ... and I don  t know what he actually said at the time  but my partner heard him say   Zoobie   ... and so from there on all our conversations throughout the department referred to whatever Dr. Baddour had seen as a Zoobie. That wasn  t what the doctor actually called it  I don  t believe  but that  s what my partner heard and that  s how the name got coined. MONEYMAKER  At the time did Dr. Baddour describe this Zoobie to the officer? HUSE  Yes  he did  to both of us as a matter of fact. He described the Zoobie as a large  upright  walking hairy creature. Dr. Baddour convinced us and later other members of my department  including one of my patrol sergeants  that in truth he  d had three separate encounters with the Zoobies. MONEYMAKER  Did Dr. Baddour say how many of these Zoobies there were and where the sightings happened? HUSE  Yeah  one sighting was made by his entire family within the confines of his yard and immediate area  and at one time they saw three Zoobies. What Dr. Baddour described to us was what he assumed was a father  mother and child with the largest of the Zoobies being over 6 feet tall  maybe 7 feet tall. The tallest was very hairy and much larger-framed than an ordinary man. What he described as the mother was about 5 feet tall  and the smaller one was about 3 or 4 feet tall. Like I said  the doctor convinced a number of us that he  d in fact seen something unusual. What happened then was that we did get involved in an investigation of the sightings. I did because of the shift I worked which was either 10 p.m. at night to 6 a.m.  or what we called the evening or overlap shift which was from 6 p.m. to 2 30 in the morning. Neither of those shifts was conducive to interviewing citizens in the area  so I wasn  t able to locate other witnesses  and I can  t recall if I ever talked  to a deputy who canvassed the area looking for witnesses. MONEYMAKER  How many people lived in the area at the time? HUSE  There were very few homes  probably 5 or no more than 6 residences  and Baddour  s was the last home on the narrow road. Going back in my memory 20 years now  I  d say his house was a quarter to a third of a mile off the main road used to get to his place  almost in a straight line due south of Alpine Blvd. That area hasn  t grown much since then  no planned residential development in there. At that time the Baddour family themselves consisted of the doctor  his wife  a daughter and a son. The daughter was 17 and the son was younger  maybe 13 or 14. MONEYMAKER  Can you describe what the terrain looks like  is it actually alpine forest  etc.? HUSE  It  s not a forest by any means  the elevation  s no more than 2300 feet. The road goes east and up  and in about another 20 miles it eventually climbs to about 5000 feet. MONEYMAKER  Does it continue up into forested areas? HUSE  Yes it does and it follows the Sweetwater River it  s about 10 miles. The Sweetwater River isn  t much of a flowing river. It runs about three-quarters of a mile south of Dr. Baddour  s place. Of course it always depended on rainfall  but the river hasn  t run continuously anytime in the 20 years I  ve been familiar with the area. There  s no snowfall at all. The terrain itself is quite steep behind Dr. Baddour  s property  going down into the (Sweetwater) river bottom itself. It  s all primarily brush and chaparral. MONEYMAKER  Any bears in the area? HUSE  I don  t think I  ve ever heard of a bear sighting in San Diego county  and again I  ve been in the area almost 23 years. We have deer everywhere here along with coyotes and fox and other types of wildlife  but no bears. MONEYMAKER  What else do you remember about Dr. Baddour  s sightings? HUSE  Let  s see  the first set of circumstances I remember was Dr. Baddour finding damage to the house when he  d just moved in. He said he bought the house from an older German couple and all of the light bulbs  inside and out  were the yellow bug repellent type. Baddour said the German man told me that he shouldn  t change them to white  that he should get used to the yellow light. MONEYMAKER  Because of an insect problem? HUSE  Baddour said the German was very evasive about that  evasive also about a lot of details regarding the house and property. The property did have some acreage  I don  t recall the size but it was larger than a city lot anyway. The property had some fruit trees in the front and back yards. I don  t remember what kind of fruit trees they were  but the house and trees were surrounded by a fence. One of Baddour  s complaints was that fruit was being picked off the trees at the tops  but not from the bottoms. The trees were upward of 7 or 8 feet high  or maybe 10 feet high. Anyway  the fruit was disappearing from the tops of his trees and his fence was getting knocked down. He had a wind chime at one of the doors made of brass or some kind of strong metal which frequently rang in the blowing wind  and at one point the wind chime suddenly turned up flattened. Baddour couldn  t explain it and we couldn  t duplicate it. It was smashed. Baddour did make a plaster cast of a footprint and I know we had photographs of it  if we didn  t in fact have a plaster cast of the print ourselves. But I do recall there was a plaster cast. MONEYMAKER  Do you remember the approximate size of the footprint? HUSE  I  m 6-foot-3 and I wear a size 12 shoe  and I  d have to say this one was larger than my shoe and much wider than my foot. I  d say it was about 13 or 14 inches in length  and I  ve been wracking my brain trying to remember if it had 4 toes or 5 toes  but I just can  t recall.** [**According to researcher  Ken Coon  who visited the Alpine area in 1971  Dr. Baddour  s  Zoobies  left V -shaped  4-toed footprints  16 inches long and 8 inches wide with the widest measurement across the toes. The foot narrowed down to 5 inches at the heel.] MONEYMAKER  But there  s some recollection that it might have had an usual number of toes? HUSE  Yes  I do seem to remember that  but I can  t bring it to mind. I know the footprint was wide overall  and less wide at the heel  but the heel was still wider than a human foot would be. MONEYMAKER  Did you or any of the officers talk to the doctor  s wife or kids? HUSE  Specifically the word came back to me  and I  m not sure which deputy found out  but the daughter said she had a sighting in the early morning hours as she boarded a school bus at Alpine Blvd. That would have been adjacent to the access road leading to the Baddour house. She was getting on the bus and spotted the creature off in the brush. There  s some very thick  very tall brush along the road there. MONEYMAKER  Do you remember any details of what she saw? HUSE  No  not really  the man who was deeply involved in this was my patrol sergeant and he  s now deceased. He was so involved with it that on his days off he  d go up there and camp to the rear of Baddour  s house. He  d take his older son along and the two of them would camp out in hope of getting a glimpse of one of the Zoobies. They never did. But he was the man who probably had more conversations with the doctor than any-body else. Another sighting involved three Zoobies sighted by a whole family. The Baddours had made it a habit to never go out after dark  but one night they were out with the son to call in their pet dog. In the dark the boy thought he saw the dog near a comer of the house and called out to It. Well  the dog came running back  but from a different corner  and what at first they thought was the dog turned out to be the smaller Zoobie. Apparently it had been laying down and it got up and stood and walked the opposite way  joining the other two  the larger male and female  and they all walked off into the brush. MONEYMAKER  Did they ever use words like  ape  or  gorilla  to describe the creatures? HUSE  No  they never did. Baddour was firm in his own mind that it wasn  t an ape or gorilla. It was something totally different than one of those. Well  for lack of anything better we thought it to be more like the California Bigfoot  based on how it was described. Whether it was black or brown I really can  t remember. MONEYMAKER  Did Dr. Baddour ever use the word Bigfoot or Sasquatch to describe the Zoobie? HUSE  Not to me  no. As a matter of fact we were assigned to make periodic checks of his residence throughout the night because most of the damage to his property was done during the night time  so my partner and I in a two-man car would drive up there and shine the spotlight around his house. Dr. Baddour was very convincing. I can still picture him coming outdoors one night dressed in his skivvies and wearing black high top military boots. That was it  a tee-shirt and shorts with those black boots and carrying that big .44 magnum. MONEYMAKER  How would you characterize the family  it sounds as though they were all educated  credible people? HUSE  Yes  I  d characterize them as exactly that. I got the impression the daughter was very intelligent  and of course Baddour himself was a medical doctor  a psychiatrist. MONEYMAKER  In our earlier phone call to arrange this interview you mentioned something about the creatures  the Zoobies  mimicking human speech ... ? HUSE  Yes  one of the lighter stories I recall happened when the doctor got home after dark one night. They had chickens there  and earlier he  d called his wife to say he was going to be late and to remind her to feed the chickens before night fall  which she did. When the doctor got home he had to exit his car  open the gate  drove through and stopped  then got out of the car again to close the gate behind him. He said that when he went to close the gate that night he heard a very low  very guttural voice say    Here chicky  chicky  chicky...   MONEYMAKER  That  s funny and not unprecedented in the research. Are you saying the impression was that one of the creature  s was imitating the doctors wife who  d called in the chickens earlier? HUSE  Exactly. It was the doctor  s opinion  and we had no reason to doubt him  that the Zoobie had some type of intelligence and the capability of producing sounds like that. MONEYMAKER  Did they ever describe any other sounds or smells  anything like that? HUSE  Smells  yes. A very pungent odor  maybe like rotting garbage. You know  he did tell us he  d set up cameras around the house with trip-wires  but he wasn  t able to get any photographs  at least not while I was working the area. I really can  t recall but I know the doctor himself had a close sighting of one of the Zoobies  and there were probably other sightings  but I can  t remember now. Of course I worked up there for just those two years  until April of 1972. After that I went to fly helicopters. So I was completely out of touch with what was happening in Alpine  and I didn  t get back there until 1981. At that time I was stationed east of the Baddour home  and I didn  t hear anything more. I did hear something about the Proctor Valley Monster when I started patrol in 1970  which if true I  d have to assume was on the order of what Dr. Baddour was describing. Now  a few years ago a deputy told me he saw a dark-colored  large  upright furry creature  not a bear and not human  up in some rocks north of Interstate 8  and possibly northwest of El Capitan (reservoir). The deputy told me it was a good distance away. Also  I was involved in a juvenile diversion camp (near Julian  northeast of Alpine)  and a couple of counselors from another camp came down and told us they  d see something they couldn  t identify in the mountains. After talking with them it was concluded that what they  d seen was probably a Zoobie. Another thing we found out  during our investigation of Dr. Baddour  s sightings  was that the Viejas Indians (reservation) just north of Interstate 8 had a legend about a giant hairy man that was the protector of their burial grounds  and those burial grounds were located just about 2 miles north of where Dr. Baddour lived. , ,San Diego,9,California ,CA,Summer ,6073,yes
299,My book   Night-Side of Gold   was written from hindsight remembrance of encounters with Bigfoot during an 8-year mining venture in the Santa Lucias along the coast of Southern California. Now  in the Lagunas around Julian  in San Diego County  I have been actively pursuing reports of Bigfoot in these mountains and the Anza-Borrego Desert below  and most particularly within a certain Indian Reservation. In February  1981  I happened to be at the right place at the right time to meet a young Indian who talked openly of his interest in Bigfoot and said he had seen him on his reservation and knew the location of caves where Bigfoot hid  and he would take me there - now! He guided me up a fearfully storm-wrecked road. My ancient van was not designed for such  nor my senior years to cope  but once started there was no turning back. Disaster seemed certain but I would die TRYING! We reached a small flat.  Park here   my escort said.  Now we hike down a canyon.  He hiked ahead rapidly and I eventually caught up with him - napping under a bush. Below him  a small stream followed a darkened canyon around a bend. I had parked in bright sunshine and in less than a mile we had descended into sunless gloom.  The caves are over there  but I am NOT about to go there.  Until my guide refused to enter a taboo area  I had not really believed his story. I knew that no money or incentive on earth will induce an Indian to enter taboo ground.  Okay  now we wait. Have a seat.  I said to him   What are we waiting for?  He said   To watch. He comes out this time of the day and walks around. He drinks from those old rock-troughs I showed you by the road. Sometimes he hangs out by that wrecked house where the road loop starts. You in a hurry?  I told him no  but that I was not about to drive back down the road in the dark. We hiked back to my van which was completely concealed in the brush until you reached the road. It was dusk when I drove out of the Reservation. After a week of heavy storms had eased up  I sought out my Indian escort. Unlike before  he was neither friendly nor talkative. Briefly I was then told   My people are complaining. Our tribal spokesman is very displeased. You will not be welcome to return  with or without your friends - and trespassers risk being shot.  So  I backed down for awhile - but I was not  out.  For three months I planned for a return trip. A friend obtained permission from a well-known Indian to drive up the mountain just to take pictures  to stay on the road and not to wander around the reservation. I had studied the map well but a certain hunch compelled me to request we reverse our direction. After a steep turn  we were blocked - but good - by a heavy pick-up in the road next to a parked bulldozer. In front stood five Indians - shoulder to shoulder  spanning the road  with their backs to us.  Looks like we  ve got trouble   my escort said  very quietly. He stepped out with a cheery greeting and  as a Forest Service firefighter  was recognized. Two men approached me.  You see Bigfoot this morning?  They knew who I was.  No  and I came up here just to shake hands with him.  That brought welcomed laughter  then a statement   I have seen him. He comes up from the canyon below the flat you just passed. He doesn  t come out very often.  This confirmed what my first Indian guide had told me. The  sticky  situation was smoothed out but not to the extent that we could continue to explore. I am presently biding my time for the right moment to return. , ,San Diego,9,California ,CA,Winter ,6073,yes
300,I  ve related this story only to very few people over the years for fear of ridicule by my peers and doubt that anyone would ever really believe me. Anyway in May 1982  while serving on active duty at Camp Pendleton  CA  I was temporarily assigned to a staff of Marines supervising a youth program consisting of a rigorous series of two week long mini-boot camps for teen-aged boys. Camp Pendleton is flanked by the Pacific on its western flank and by the Cleveland National Forest [on its] northeastern flank. Three different Mt. ranges intersect the base itself and I am very familiar with every nook and cranny on its over 200 000 acres of mountains  ridges  ravines  canyons  trails  back roads and the like. Anyway on one particular calm night after a long grueling day of forced marches  displays and demonstrations we took all 300 boys up to a bivouac site for the night. The site is situated on large  open meadow shelf above the Infantry Training School at San Onofre/52 area. The boys were exhausted yet eagerly setting up their shelter-halves. They began to get a little too loud  so I began to quiet them and bed them down for the night. The rest of the staff was situated about 35 meters away  up on a little knoll that overlooked the boys. However  I wasn  t aware that the staff had already bedded down and that I was the last one still up except for the radio watch  which was half asleep too. It had become dark with exception of a bit of starlight  which gave me a very good range of vision. Finally I succeeded in getting the kids in the sack and quiet. I then stood for a few moments to ensure all was secure and that not one peep could be heard and none could be. As I turned facing west and looked towards the closest edge of the perimeter I noticed a tall  dark  bulky figure standing about 15 meters beyond the last tent or 20 meters from where I stood. We seemed to be staring at each other  but itâ€™s hard to say because I could not make out any of its facial definition  but I had a strong gut feeling that it was checking me out real good since I was the only thing moving around. I could feel my heart begin to pound and my entire body felt like it wanted to anchor to the ground. There was no doubt someone or something very odd and dangerous was standing there looking at me. I mean this thing was TALL and wide at the shoulders. I used my peripheral vision to make sure I wasn  t seeing things  but it only confirmed what I already knew. It gently and slightly moved its upper body left and right ever so slowly as though looking around to its front  surveying the area. It was an easy 8 feet tall. Like I mentioned previously  all I could make out was its massive silhouette and no real detail features. It had very broad shoulders  little or no neck  dark  and looked very powerful. I decided to go get a flashlight out of our vehicle at the top of the knoll and let staff know what was going on. So I began to cautiously and quietly step backwards to prevent whatever it was from charging or coming into bivouac. I continued to keep an eye on the dang thing  which just remained in the same spot. Almost halfway up the knoll I lost sight of it  but I continued to move slowly still trying to locate it. From atop of the knoll it was very difficult to see anything clearly outside the fringe of perimeter because of the dark. I walked back down to the tents  scanned the area with the flashlight  but didnâ€™t see anything like I had before. The figure had obviously moved. So instead of waking anybody up I sat up for a while and waited to see what and if anything would happen. I also hoped the darn thing wouldn  t pop up behind me (we were all unarmed). It would have been worse and maybe a calamity if I had  pushed the panic button and had waken everybody up. After all  we were in charge of nearly 300 young street kids without any formal training  out in the open and I didnâ€™t need the grief if nothing I said or described could have been verified. Thankfully nothing else occurred that night. In the morning just before daybreak I bee-lined for the spot where I saw the thing standing. There wasn  t anything there ... nothing. Not a pole  a bush  a tree  a reed.  I mean nothing that could have simulated what I had seen. We were situated on flat  clear open ground with exception of the knoll and a tree line about 50 to 60 meters away and a mountain behind that which I knew all existed and had seen back-dropped way beyond the figure the previous evening. The ground was grassy  but was already pretty well matted down and rutted by the constant foot and vehicle movement in that particular training area. I know I saw something that wasn  t normal. I know  it wasn  t hoax  I know it wasnâ€™t the kids (they were all accounted for). I trust my judgment and Iâ€™m now 46 years old and still have perfect vision. I know it wasn  t any of the staff because I had seen all of them sleeping when I got up the hill. At that time I had nearly 11 years of active military service in the infantry and had done plenty of night OP  s [ed  Observation Posts] to know how to use my eyes in the dark and to know the difference between a bush and a moving object. This was BIG  and real! Oh  and the thing was very quiet  I didnâ€™t hear it make a sound. ,Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton  California  south of the Cleveland National Forest.

301,About 1988  my girlfriend and I were tent camping on Palomar Mountain with another couple. After the first night they left and we decided to spend one more night. Into the late afternoon I had the feeling we were being watched which persisted until we decided to turn in. After settling down into our tent  and being quiet for about 1/2 hour. I heard fast footsteps run through our camp. They were very heavy footfalls like from a heavy man and sounded like someone running flat-footed in boots. I thought maybe it was a man  but why is a man running through my camp on a dark  moonless night? My girlfriend was asleep so she didn  t hear. I was still awake as I felt uneasy. Since  it  kept running  I decided not to venture outside to take a look. Nothing else occurred that night and I went to sleep soon after. The next morning there were no footprints or other evidence. ,It was so long ago  I don  t remember the name of the area on Palomar Mountain where we camped. I do remember being able to look down the mountain and see a road with a cow catcher on it. ,San Diego,9,California ,CA,Summer ,6073,no
302,Summer of 1993 time- afternoon  sunny day location- la jolla indian reservation  palomar mtns. I was walking along the creek that runs thru the campground  looking for tracks of whatever animals walked on the sandy path. I walked thru a narrow section between rocks  the creek and a steep hillside. I entered a small meadow and began walking into it. got approximately halfway into meadow when I started to get a tingling sensation on the back of my neck  as if something was watching me. I turned around and saw a large creature squatted down in the middle of the path I just walked on. The animal stood up and very quickly walked up the brushy embankment. There was no sound at all  no branches or twigs snapping  and then it was gone. I walked back to the point were I saw it squatted and it had left a single  dark brown and black stool on the path. I could not judge sex of the animal  only that it was brown  walked on two legs and was approximately six feet tall. the speed it covered the terrain and its stealth were both impressive and somewhat scary. ,drive into campgrounds and head down stream to where the path following right side of the stream begins to narrow due to brush  rocks stream(on left)and steep hillside(on right). ,San Diego,9,California ,CA,Summer ,6073,yes
303,Two years ago while camping at the lake (without permission) we were walking at the south-western inflow to the lake (a seasonal creek.) The water level of the lake was high due to the El Nino rains and the  creek  extended out from the lake covering the dirt road with about two feet of water. Three of us were returning from climbing Boundary Peak when we had to take our shoes off to wade across the creek. Our footprints were clear and distinct in the silty/sandy bottom -- however  near the other side we saw a set of footprints that looked like someone had walked into the water and then back out. These footprints were about the same size as ours  however  they were blurred and had kind of fuzzy marks all around. They had not been there when we had crossed the same spot an hour before. We all commented about how weird they looked. Later that evening when we sat around our campfire a U.S. Border Patrol Agent stopped by to chat. He had been dragging some old tires along the dirt roads near the border so that he could return later to see if any illegal aliens had crossed the border at that point. We told him about the weird tracks we had seen and he said   Oh  yeah  we call him Little Foot --   cause the prints aren  t big enough to be a Big Foot. Nobody  s seen him  though.  The Agent went on to say that everybody in his office just thought it was a Mexican with hairy feet. , ,San Diego,9,California ,CA,Summer ,6073,yes
304,My wife and I were camping in the Cleveland National Forest  Mount Laguna area. [East of San Diego] The campground is called Burnt Rancheria. It was exactly 3 14am. My wife woke me up because she needed to use the restroom really bad.  The restroom was about 50 yards away and she was afraid to go alone.  As I was putting on my shoes  I started hearing sounds that reminded me of an ax hitting wood (or a tree)  but louder.  It wasnâ€™t like someone was cutting wood  because the sounds were not in rapid succession  they were 2 or 3 seconds apart. In total I think I heard 4 or 5 of them.  I put on my shoes  stepped out of my tent  and kept hearing them  finally realizing that they sounded like the â€œknocking soundsâ€ described by people who have reported bigfoot encounters. After about 5 seconds they stopped  and (I donâ€™t know if this was just my imagination or not) I started to hear echoes of â€œvoicesâ€.  I say voices because it sounded like someone talking but at the same time it was gibberish with grunts. The next day my sister in law  who was camping with us  started to give us a hard time about all the noise we were making getting out of the tent and going to the rest room.  So I asked her if she heard the â€œknocking soundsâ€ she said she did. She described them as someone dropping a heavy rock on a ply wood.  I asked my wife if she heard them but she said she was still half asleep and trying not to wet herself.  Iâ€™ve seen the show â€œFinding Bigfootâ€ and know what sounds sasquatches reportedly make  but I never thought I would actually hear them. ,We were in the Burnt Rancherias Campground in the Cleveland National Forest. ,San Diego,9,California ,CA,Summer ,6073,no
305,We went camping for a couple nights near Julian  CA. in a location just a couple miles south of town adjacent to Hwy 79. We arrived on a Friday night and stayed thru Sunday afternoon. We were sharing a tent trailer with friends. Both mornings before dawn I walked my wife over to the nearby porta-potty/restroom. Both nights were clear and quite dark with partial moonlight but the area has a lot of trees so there are shadows even though you can see well enough to walk over to the restrooms without a flashlight. The first morning we walked over to the bathroom without incident and it  s very quiet there  especially in the evenings. The second morning probably about 0540 as I waited for my wife I very clearly heard a tree knock. It came from north of our location. When my wife came out of the restroom I told her what I heard and asked her if she heard it. She did not. We walked back to the tent trailer and got back in bed as the sun was not rising until closer to 0700. We were both awake about 15 minutes later and both heard a single whoop sound this time from a bit to the east. Right after the whoop sound was heard there were blue jays in the trees around us that went nuts making all kinds of noise for about 20 seconds then all was quiet again. A bit later  still before dark  I got up and kindled the fire a bit outside and decided to take my vehicle up the road to drop some trash off near the campground office. Another friend from a second tent trailer also camping with us was up at this time. I told her about the tree knock and whoop that was heard. When I returned from the quick errand to the trash bin. She told me she had also heard a tree knock  but this time it was to our west. A few minutes later I heard 2 more whoops one from the south east then a couple minutes after that to the south. These were not coyotes yipping. Not sure what else to say about it but it was interesting! ,The tree knocks and whoops were heard while camping at Pinezanita Campground. I don  t know if the campground owners would want the camp named in your report. This is a very quiet campground with many retired folks that stay here. ,San Diego,9,California ,CA,Fall ,6073,no
306,I was hunting with a friend for wild boar in the Los Padres National Forest near Lake Cachuma  Ca.  The lake runs on sort of an angle from west/northwest to east/southeast.  Just above the lake when travelling north on hwy 154 is an access road leading into the forest to a point near the northwest end of the lake (probably about 2 1/2 miles from the lake).  Near that point and about 3/4 to one mile away from the ranger station located there  my friend and I hunted along the west side of the road.  We were both armed with high powered rifles (I had a 300 H&H Magnum with 200 grain roundnose bullets).  This is rough country!  We were sitting on a hillside looking down the hill when we noticed what seemed to be movement. After about 1/2 hr or so  and not seeing any more movement  we decided to go and investigate what the movement had been below us on the hillside.  We crossed the trail which led into the area and went further down the hill toward the ranger station which was about 3/4 mile lower on the hillside around a bend.  Nothing was observed. About 5-10 minutes later  we climbed back up the hill and onto the trail only to find some footprints.  The footprints were about 18 inches long and (although we did not measure them) approximately 40 inches apart.  Whatever made the prints was heavy because the prints were deep in the soil  much deeper than any person could have made (especially in that short a timeframe).  The prints lead along the trail going w/nw. and were on top of our footprints where we had crossed the trail going down the hill less than 10 minutes before. We followed the prints for approximately 1 mile  but never saw anything except the continuing footprints.  We finally reached a vantage point  and could view the trail ahead for a mile or so.  It was empty  so we gave up and returned to the car. Whatever made those prints was able to get far enough ahead of us that we could not catch up and it had to be far enough ahead to be out of view when we reached the vantage point.  I do not think a person could have done this even if running.

307,This happened 48 years ago. I was a boy 13 years old and my friend and I were riding our bikes in a remote part of the Santa Cruz Mts. in what today is a State Park. However  at the time this was private land that had been logged over in the late 1800  s and early 20th Century. This land is steep  treed with redwoods and coastal oaks  very dense and rugged. Nothing in the way of logging  ranching or man made activity was happening or for that matter since the last logging in the 1920  s. This was a place that maybe saw a handful of people a year. We had pushed our bikes uphill for the last two hours and were riding downhill on a old fire road. We were going fast and quiet  when I slowed down for a muddy spot so as not to lose control  I noticed to my right just behind a redwood tree a figure that was about the same color of the tree bark  dark brown. It stepped from behind the tree and ran downhill. I stopped  dropped my bike and ran the twenty feet to the edge of the road  by this time it was running fast  with the unmistakeable sound of two feet treading on Tanbark Oak leaves. The creature was over six feet tall  and had the shape of a man. I have camped in the area since this encounter and have heard a high pitch whistle sound and also a thumping of wood on wood more than once. Often  we had the sense of being watched  and left the area because of this feeling. ,This is near the epicenter of the   89 Earthquake. The area specifically where this happened is called Hinkley Basin. This in now part of Nisine Marks State Park. ,Santa Cruz,3,California ,CA,Spring ,6087,yes
308,I saw one of these sasquatch-bigfoot things one night walking on the side of the highway. I want to say it was in the early fall of 1980  because my kids were very young. My husband and I were driving up Hecker Pass from Watsonville  on our way to Mt Madonna to meet relatives for what I want to say was a dinner or dinner event. it seems so long ago. It happened very fast  but what I saw looked covered in brown hair from head to toe and was huge  walking just like a man. It scared me to death! My husband wasn  t paying attention but he knew I saw something that frightened me terribly because I reacted emotionally so quickly. We were coming around a turn. I remember it being a very windy road  and it was walking with it  s back to me. It was a very foresty area with lots of redwoods everywhere. It was so quick but so clear. I  m absolutely convinced of what I saw and still get shaken up when I think about it. I had great eyesight then and still have it now. I haven  t talked about this with many people and am not sure who I told back then other than maybe my immediete family. It  s been almost 30 years. Last week my husband and I were celebrating 4th of July at a party. I was stunned as I overhead Bart Cutino talking to my cousin about bigfoot as he was walking out the door.  I had no idea he looks for them and I haven  t heard anything in the news in a long time. My eldest daughter used to babysit him when he was very young and I  ve known his mother my whole life. When I told him what I saw he convinced me to look at this site and report what happened.  I wish I could remember more. It  s just been so long. ,Take Highway 1 north from Monterey  to the Green Valley (Highway 152 East) exit in Watsonville. and turn right on Green Valley. Take Green Valley east to the intersection with Airport Boulevard (to the left) and Holohan Road (to the right). Turn right onto Holohan Road and continue until you reach Highway 152. Turn left (East) onto Highway 152. It was a very winding stretch as I was coming around a turn and heading straight slightly uphill. I remember the area was covered in redwoods. ,Santa Cruz,3,California ,CA,Fall ,6087,yes
309,We have had various incidents over the past few years since 1998-2004 including 3 sightings  one amazing vocalization occasion  wood knocking  and one footprint.  First I must say that I don  t think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it  s (plural) normal range or migration route. The first sighting was in 1998 in the winter  we are not really sure...  My brother was driving home and was on our private driveway when he drove by something that he could not describe.  He walked in andsaid he had just saw a bear or a big black person wearing animal fur  or a cow...  Basically his mind could not fit what he saw into any specific category  and he was very confused.  Upon questioning him he said it looked like a homeless person wearing animal skins.  He said they passed right by eachother going in opposite directions.  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate.  I was thinking there was a homeless person passing through... But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes...  I was not thinking about a bigfoot  it didn  t really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually...  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I  m a size 12  I put my foot inside this track...  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot.  And it was sunk into a hard pack dirt road about an inch or more.  Being 200lbs myself  I jumped around trying to make an impression an inch deep in this strata but to no avail.  I couldn  t sink my own track at all! I mean no inches  nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me...  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight)... Number one  bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought)  and my brother did not come in and say   I just saw a bigfoot!   So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn  t until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said   oh yeah  that makes sense now...   It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website.  I found it while web surfing and his sighting started to make sense...  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot.  We live in a typical second growth redwood forest with all the typical animals that I see quite often.  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now. 2004 was an exciting year.  We had 2 more sightings and a very loud vocal performance!  So  I was watching tv outside in the covered porch/ gazebo.  If you turn down the tv you can hear all of the night sounds as if you were outside.  Around 11 30ish pm  I heard something so I turned the tv off.  I then heard a very loud screaming roar right in front of my house.  And judging from the location of the first sound I heard that was distorted by the tv  I deduced that whatever this was was walking down my driveway and was very close!  It roared twice more while following the road.  I was dumbfounded!!!  And then I got scared... I  ve lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight.  You couldn  t have dragged me outside at this point!  I  m 6  3  220lbs  and this thing sounded huge. I compare the roar to the decibel level of a siren!  It just echoed off the hills.  I have compared it to the recordings on this sight and it is very close to the Washington recordings  especially the one from 2005.  I am so glad that my dad and mom both heard this!  It just gave you the impression that it had huge lungs to make such a loud noise!  But interestingly enough the last roar was ended with two very clear dog barks that I presume were mimicked...  All of the dogs in the vicinty were going crazy except the dogs that were the closest to where this thing had traveled... Two nights later was the second sighting.  This time it was in the front yard of my Dads house.  I was leaving in my Suburban.  I was just edging down the driveway when I got something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked at what appeared to be a large pile of redwood bark lying in the yard as if my dad had cut down one of his trees and had raked all the bark into a pile.  Redwood bark is reddish...  As I passed slowly by I realized that my dad had not cut down any of his trees and that there would be no reason for a large pile of redwood bark to be piled there.  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked.  There was a fence between us and if I were in a smaller car I wouldn  t have seen it  but I was very high up in a raised Suburban so I could see over the fence.  It looked as if it was on it  s knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it  s arms over it head.  I say semi worked because I kept driving and didn  t realize what I had seen until a couple of minutes later.  When I went back my pile of redwood bark had disapeared.  I was so disapointed because I was only about 15 ft away! The next sighting I again missed out by seconds!  My wife and I were driving on our driveway and she said she had just I contact with someone...  I had driven about 30 more ft and stopped. I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree.  The windows of the car were still dewed up from the cold morning so I backed up and got out.  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves.  It was a very definitive sound...  I would have followed if I was not in business clothes... So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area.  There are 60-70 000 acres near by and I believe we are in a corner of their range that they visit every once in awhile since the occurances are not everyday. , ,Santa Cruz,3,California ,CA,Spring ,6087,yes
310,I never thought I would write this sort of thing on this forum  but well...here goes. Way before I joined the Church  my young wife and I worked for a private school at the end of the road near French Gulch CA. This is on the edge of the Trinity Mountains (Big Foot Country)  and about 25 miles into the woods  behind Clair Engle Lake. It was pretty isolated. Once in awhile log trucks would go by  but mostly no one used the road to come there or go past. I was assigned midnight bed checks  and had to walk through the entire compound. This was a former ranch  the main house and girls cabins on one side  along with the Teacher  s and staff cabins and trailer  and across the creek  and up the pasture alongside the woods  the boy  s line of cabins. To cross the creek  I could either wade or ford  where the cars crossed  or walk past the cook house  that sat next to the creek and cross over on a suspension bridge  that was about jeep wide. We used it only for walking. I sometimes waded because bears would come raid the trash cans  and that was a bother to get past them sometimes. It was a bit crisp that night  so I decided to walk the bridge  cross the pasture  and walkup the half mile or so along the cabins  to check each one. My boots made a hollow thumping noise as I crossed  and the bridge began to sway like it always did  with a side to side motion  as well as a rolling wave to the deck. The water was about 5 feet below me  and only filled about 10 feet across the bottom. The edges of the creek  about 20 feet per side  were dry and exposed rocks and boulders. The creek was about 2 feet deep and swirled softly  chuckling between and over the rocks. There was no moon  but there was sufficient starlight  to see  once I had walked from my trailer  to the bridge  about a quarter mile. A single yard light was on up at the owner  s house  but none down at my end of the headquarters compound. I walked up to each cabin  and checked them all. Everyone was asleep  no deer were in the pasture  and the one horse we had  was up at the top end of the pasture  snorting at me  and pawing the ground. That was not unusual  so I just headed back to the bottom of the hill toward the bridge. The stars were bright  and the sky was black. As I approached the bridge  I thought I could hear something near the trash cans on the creek side of the cook house. Something was snuffling around and then banging trash can lids onto the ground.  Crap   I thought   Bears. I could hear whatever it was knocking over the cans  and rooting around in them. I was a bit frustrated  since the day guy was supposed to have taken them to town  that afternoon  to dump them to avoid just this sort of thing. I picked up a couple of large smooth river rocks  and stepped onto the bridge. This bridge is about 60 feet long  a suspension bridge  about 15 feet wide. The cables are too high  except in the middle to touch  to use as a hand rail  then too low in the middle to use for that either. The planks are 3  thick  10 inches wide  very heavy  and heavily oiled. They made a deep thump when trod upon. I stepped quietly onto the bridge  and drew back my arm. The animal had stopped  and with a whiff  dropped the can it was exploring with a crash. I threw the river rock as hard as I could  and it thumped down  just under the eaves of the building  and rolled into a can  Wham! I peered into the darkness  and shadow under the eaves of the cook shack  but could not see anything but a darker shadow  where I though this animal was. The animal gave out another  Woof   like a bear would when he is trying to sniff something out. As it stood  I realized  that although I couldn  t see much  I could tell that a head and shoulders had risen about the edge of the eaves.  Wow!  My head was trying to compute   animal on top of a trash can  or a big animal on the ground  that eave is at least 8 feet from the ground...  It wasn  t making sense  but the moment didn  t last long. With a rumble deep in its chest it began moving out into the open  toward the end of the bridge. I by now was almost to the middle  so I started backing up  and got to about 1/4th of the way from the end. I started hollering at it  and chucked the other two rocks I had with me  one landing at his feet  and the other hitting somewhere near his hip.  He came up out of a crouch  and stood erect. He was just shorter than the bridge uprights  and they were ten feet tall!  Oh  crap   I thought. As he walked forward  the gait was more like a big man  than any bear I had ever seen. Only he was far bigger than any man I had ever seen either. Its legs where long  and this was NO BEAR! Now here you are going to have to trust me. I have hunted all my life  and I am no city boy. I know a bear when I see one  and I had no reason to expect anything else here. I began shouting at it  as I backed up. He stepped onto the bridge  and in two steps was over the free-swinging portion. The bridge sagged  and I jumped up and down  stomping my feet  and shouting. I backed to the ground  and bent to pick up some more rocks. I stepped forward  pounded on the bridge  and threw another rock; saying  Hey  get!  As the rock sailed I thought that I was using some puny weapons. I also realized my voice was pretty weak. I was scared **itless! I threw two more rocks in quick succession  and they bounced on the deck  and flew off into the dark  one splashing into the creek. He dodged them handily. His eyes glowed in the dark  and he took a step closer. I started jumping up and down  and getting the bridge to moving sideways and up and down. I had a hold of one of the upright cables  and I had the bridge going pretty good. The animal held onto the cables  above his head  and then with one hand  he vaulted the cables  and disappeared below the bridge. I thought he was headed my way under the bridge  and I jumped back off and grabbed a two handed rock  to smash his face or whatever I could. I realized I could hear him splashing in the creek  and peered into the darkness  and saw the form running upstream into the back country. I stood a second  heart pounding  and realized there was a foul stench in the air  as a slight breeze carried his scent from that side of the bridge. It smelled of dead animals  and rotten food  and funky bad feet and armpits. I made my way across the bridge  across the compound  hefting the two handed rock  and eventually got to my trailer. No lights had come on in any of the cabins  or at the owner  s house  and no one had come to help me. I slid open the glass door  stepped inside  and slid it back  and leaned against the wall. My wife was in back reading  with a small light on. She looked at me and asked me what was wrong. I don  t know what that was  I won  t argue for Bigfoot  nor any other animal. I know it was not a bear. I know what that looks like. ,From Hwy. 299  & then up the French Gultch Rd. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Spring ,6089,yes
311,My family and I went to lake Shasta CA. To camp at antler camp ground.  While we were there  we went to this cove on the lake and had a picnic.  After the picnic  me and my cousin jimmy and my little sister Kim stayed in the cove to go fishing while everybody else went back out to the boat dock.  After awhile  my sister wanted to go out to the dock to be with my older sister  so I put her on my shoulders and started walking.  About 1/4 mile half way out I started hearing something walking in the woods. I stopped  it stopped. I started  it started. So I kept walking. I dropped my sister off and started heading back.  A little way in and I started hearing the footsteps again. Now they were closer and I could see something in the shadows. As I kept walking  it kept getting closer. I stopped again and all of a sudden  it came crashing through the brush straight for me. I just stood there  looking at it then it stopped about 5 feet from me and I could plainly see what was standing there  but I couldnâ€™t believe what I was seeing. I remember noticing it had big reddish brown eyes that seemed to stare right through me.  It gave me the creeps. Then I noticed it had big muscular arms and huge hands. Then I looked down and saw big feet. Then I started scanning up and saw some big calves and thighs. It was definitely a male and was dark brownish black in color. I just stood there looking at him and then I said to my cousin jimmy  who was about 10 to 15 feet away from me  â€œlookâ€ and pointed at it. He took one look and screamed  and then he jumped into the lake.  I gave a yell and did the same. We swam out into the center of the cove and the creature stood there watching us. My cousin swam to the dock but I stayed. I was totally curious as to what it was but scared at the same time. Then it looked toward the back of the cove like it was startled and it ran up at least a 40 to 45% hill through brush and trees.  It covered at least a couple hundred feet in what seemed like 2 or 3 seconds and was gone.   I heard and saw some people coming down a trail from a cabin up on the hill. When they got close  I asked them if they ever heard of bigfoot.  They said  â€œyeah  they come around are cabin once in a while.â€ ,We went there in a boat I think it was on a north bank were the boat dock was.  I think I could find it if I went back there but it  s hard to explain.  I think the cove was in a northern direction too. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Spring ,6089,yes
312,We saw  bigfoot  about 4 am in Shasta County  CA while driving on 299West.  It was 1978 or 1979 and we were driving from Weaverville  CA to Idaho. Upon reaching Susanville  CA we had a hard time buying gasoling because it was during the shortage.  We decided due to the desolate nature of the road we would be driving it would be better to go back home.  We felt many gas stations would be closed and we couldn  t get fuel when we needed it.  Anyway  we were driving west on 299 when from our left a reddish-tan (more tan than red) image stepped onto the roadway and in two strides was over the road and into the ravine on the right side of the road.  It was only illuminated in our headlights briefly and the sighting was only a few seconds.  My husband and I hadn  t been talking and after a minute or so my husband said  Did you see that? .  His question confirmed to me that I indeed saw what I thought I saw.  I would estimate the bigfoot to be about 7   tall. ,All we know is it was a right curve leading to a left curve and so on. Haven  t been able to identify the curve since then but have tried. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Fall ,6089,yes
313,This is an old report so I don  t know if it will be of any use but my wife and I remember it as if it were yesterday.  We had just moved to California from Colorado and didn  t know anywhere to hike so we drove to a Ranger Station in Shasta Lake. We bought a map and although it was the 4th of July weekend we asked the rangers if there was anyplace we could go that would be isolated or not too crowded. We got a fire permit because we were planning to 4 wheel somewhere remote and then hike to a camp area. We were told to drive on a logging road next to squaw creek and were shown some turns to take to end up past the last campground on Squaw creek. We drove until we spotted a stream leading up to a meadow about 200 yards from the road. We crossed a deep creek with our camping gear and helped our dog cross because the water was swift enough to make swimming across difficult. We set up our tent and decided to follow the creek to see if fishing might be good. We were surprised by an abandoned beaver dam and the pond was full of fish. I wanted to hike a bit further and my wife wanted to finish some reading so she went back to camp with the dog. I continued hiking until I heard something following me. When I stopped it stopped. I suspected I was being followed by a couger so I made lots of noise by stepping on branches and acting like I wasn  t afraid of anything. I still stopped from time to time to look toward the area of the noise and had my knife ready along with a big stick that I purposely hit against rocks and trees to make myself appear aggressive. Finally I got back to camp and my wife asked me what was going on. I didn  t want to scare her so I said it was getting dark and had to get some firewood. She said the dog had been growling and looking in the direction from which I had come. I still didn  t say anything mainly because I wasn  t afraid because I had packed a gun with plenty of ammo. I had been hunting and in the woods all my life. I figured a fire would keep the lion away along with our talking and laughing  plus we had a big husky dog that was a good protector. When I got back to camp with some wood my wife informed me that the dog must have taked a poop around the camp site because it stunk. It did smell but I was unable to find anything to get rid of. We lit a fire and cooked then settled back to let the fire burn out. When the fire got low we were terrified by the sound of breaking branches and a sound unlike anything I have ever heard in my life. I screamed to my wife to throw more wood on the fire and rushed to the tent to get my gun. I was bowled over first by my wife then the dog. I got the gun and yelled to my wife to get the flashlights. We threw more wood on the fire and heard something retreat. At this point I got my composure back and we shined our very bright lights into the woods hoping to pick out a pair of eyes. When I didn  t see any I was alamed because I thought all animals eyes glowed in the dark as they reflected light. I was thinking that there must be a man out there trying to scare us. So I yelled for whoever was out there to identify himself because I has a gun and was prepared to shoot if I heard another noise. Now I had to tell my wife what had happened on my hike and what I still assume is correct about animals eyes. We talked about going back to the bronco and leaving but decided it was too risky to walk 200 yards through the woods and then have to cross the steam in the dark where we could easily step in a hole and lose the gun or be at a big disadvantage. We decided to burn a big fire all night and stay awake. As frightened as we were I talked my wife into getting some sleep on my lap and I would stay awake. She fell asleep and then so did I. We were startled awake by the dog growling and something rushing toward us through the trees. We threw more wood on the fire and screamed into the woods that we were ready to shoot. Again a retreat as the fire got bigger. Now we were definitly awake for the rest of the night. The next morning we packed up and left. When we got down to the stream I remembered my axe shovel and saw were still at the camp so I went back for them. I was greeted by a horrible smell  but that was it so I grabbed my things and ran down the hill. When I got close to the stream I slowed down and started walking. My wife informed me that right after I left the dog was growling and looking in the direction that I had taken. Since this incident we now camp in designated campsites that have other campers. We always used to 4 wheel or hike to places to camp that were completly isolated. We never considered bigfoot until I told my story to a new friend and he mentioned that the situation was similar to bigfoot related incidents. ,Road by Squaw Creek about 2 to 4 miles past the last camp ground. Isolated enough that we only saw two guys on dirt bikes and two forest rangers in the area long before the incident happened. The rangers checked our campfire permit and briefed us on their interpretation of a safe fire. They commented that they had never seen anyone camped this far out. It did take a 2 to 3 hours to get to the spot where we eventually camped. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,yes
314,I was on a houseboat vacation with my family at Shasta Lake when I was 13.  We had put our houseboat to shore in a secluded cove that branched off of the main lake.  I went on a walk alone along the shore  and then followed a near-dry creek bed that came down out of the nearby woods to the lake.  I had followed the creek bed for about a mile when I came upon two sets of footprints in the mud along the creek bed.  Both looked human-like  with five-toes.  One set was about a size 14  the other about a size 9  comparing them to my own foot at the time.  They were very wide prints  and appeared neary flat-footed.  I was curious  though I hadn  t made the Bigfoot connection yet.  It had seemed odd to me that someone would have been barefoot this far into the woods.  The tracks came out of the nearby woods  down to the creek bed  and they then followed the bed for a while away from the lake and into the deeper wooded region.  After a few hundred yards  they turned up a slight grade and into the woods on the opposite side from which they started.  Another thing that made me suspicious of the prints were that they had crossed the rocky creek bed  which was filled with sharp  shale-like stones.  It seemed to me that it would have been a very painful experience for any human to walk those rocks barefoot.  I noted that the larger prints were set wider apart than the smaller prints.  Still not making a BF connection  I went back to the houseboat and said nothing to my family. That night my brother and I were in our sleeping bags on top of the houseboat  still parked in the same spot.  We were both drifting off to sleep when we both heard a very loud scream.  It sounded like it was fairly far away.  At first  I thought it had been a woman screaming.  Then I hear the scream again.  It started off sounding like a baby beginning to wail  but then got louder and more high-pitched like a woman  s voice in full scream.  It seemed resonant  like it was coming out of a hollow tube.  As it ended  it dropped down into a low gargle-like growl.  Both screams lasted maybe three seconds each.  It was then that I put the footprints and scream together in my head.  Though my brother heard the screams also  we didn  t really talk about it.  My brother buried his head in his bag  while I tried to stay awake to listen for more sounds.  After a while I had fallen asleep  and awoke the next morning to find that my family had already moved the houseboat out of the cove as I slept  so I didn  t get to go back to investigate the footprints again.  I did not tell my family about my Bigfoot suspicians  but my brother did mention to me later that he heard a  bear  walking along the shore that night  near where the houseboat was aground.  He said he heard heavy footsteps  heavy breathing  and some grunting.  I  m not so sure I buy the  bear  theory. , ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,no
315,Well  first I would like to state that I currently live in the Fresno area. But I was raised in Redding  CA. I have hunted all my life  and have heard various critters around and in my tent. My friend Chris and I were camping out one night during the summer on Mt. Shasta Bally. I figure it was between 1 00 and 2 00 in the morning. My friend and I were awakened by something walking around the pickup  where we were sleeping in the bed of the truck. My first thought was bear    cause there are a lot of them in that area. I have had many bears walk around my tent in the Thousand Lakes Wilderness Area near Burney  CA. But this did not sound anything like a bear. It was then that I noticed my friend was awake and looking at me. He asked me   What is that?  I really didn  t know what to make of it. It seemed to be about 40-60 feet away from the truck when we first looked at each other. It circled the truck and when it was near the thicker brush it seemed to come closer. Then it really freaked me out because we smelled a really wild smell. It kinda reminded me of the smell of my dog after he got tore up by coyotes. At the time  Bigfoot never crossed my mind. But my hair totally stood up on the back of my neck. My friend was in the same state. We were both armed with large-caliber handguns at the time but were too scared to sit up and look. We both just laid there looking at each other. I could hear myself breathing and tried to be as quiet as I could. Something inside me told me that if you sit up you aren  t going to make it off this hill. This thing circled the truck for what I would guess to be about between 1-1/2 or two hours  moving closer  breaking branches -- what sounded like on purpose -- and making grunting sounds. Some time before it got light  it seemed to move off to the southwest. When the sun came and it was light enough to see we got up and looked around the truck. We never got more than about 30 feet from the truck before we noticed disturbed pine needles and broken limbs on the trees about 6 feet off the ground. My friend and I left that morning and went back into Redding. We told a few friends and my Dad about what happened. He had no answers either for what happened. I can remember thinking that it sounded like something walking on two legs. That really shook me up that day and to this day I will not go back on Mt. Bally at night. I have been back to that spot probably 50 times since then during the day  but towards evening times it bothers me to even be near that mountain. ,You take 299 West out of Redding. Go past Old Shasta up to Whiskeytown Lake and take the first turn to the left heading towards Brandy Creek. Just past Brandy Creek Recreation Area there is a turn to your left that takes you up towards Sheep Camp and it turns to dirt track about 1/4 of a mile up the road. You go past Sheep Camp heading up the mountain. Not sure exactly what the name is  but I believe its called Mt. Bally or Baldy. The road is very steep  but there are TV transmitters at the tops of this hill. The road switches back and forth up the hill. But near the top of the hill it switches back and you can see it is just like a little step before the top and right on the edge of the tree line. There is a little turn-out there where you can overlook Whiskeytown Lake. That is where we camped. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,yes
316,This story was related to me 15 years ago.I used to ranch in northern california 35 miles north of Redding. I leased 640 acres located neat hwy 5 and dog creek road.  A friend of mine lived 14 miles south and west on dog creek road. I believe this was on a saturday another friend of mine and myself decided to ride my horses back to see conrad.The ride took about 2-2& 1 half hours. after gettinging there conrad told me a story. it goes like this.  yesterday afternoon he shot a deer and hung it from a tree behind his house. that night as he was going to let his dogs out they started whinning and would not leave.then he heard a scream a type he never heard before coming from the back of the house. he went outside on his back pourch and said he saw a large ape like creature looking back at him. he then stated it grabed his deer and ran off back into the forest area. at first laugh it off then he said come look at this. he showed myself and this other friend where it stood and where ran away to. while it ran away with the deer it had taken out about 20 feet of barbed wire fence and left some hair on one of the barbs. Well I haved hunted all my life and never seen hair quite like it it looked like bear but not really.  he never reported because he did not want the publicity as he was avery private person. I don  t if you believe me or not but this is his story as told to me. ,five miles north on hwy 5. turn west on dog creek road. go about 2 tenths of a mile and turn left on the first dirt roadfollow it back about 14 miles you will be heading south on your right hand sid there should be along driveway (dirt) that is the entrance to his place. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Fall ,6089,yes
317,In 1987  on the night of the first day of the California x1 deer season  myself and my hunting partner were sitting around the campfire a couple of hours after dinner  just relaxing and enjoying the fire. Down to the south is a small clearing. The moon was out and we noticed some movement in the clearing. The moon gave off just enough light that we saw a figure move slowly across the clearing. Lucky  my partner  thought it might be a bear  so we didn  t pay it much mind. I guess about 10 or fifteen minutes passed  when all of a sudden we heard dry brush breaking up on the side of the mountain. From where the camp is located we were on the east side of the mountain. From that point the mountain goes straight up. Lots of brush and timber. Suddenly  whatever it was started screaming and we could hear it crashing through the brush. It scared the hell out of us. Then it must have turned and headed uphill. It was still screaming but it sounded like it was getting further away. We were both too shook-up to move  so we just sat there not saying a word. I guess about 20 minutes passed without hearing anything  then all of a sudden we heard a log come flying down the mountain crashing through the brush. Then it started again  this time the screaming was louder and seemed to be closer. The wind was coming from the north  which was where the spring was. All of a sudden it smelled like something had died. It smelled like a strong urine odor. The smell was overwhelming; it was like somebody had opened an outhouse door or something. And the screaming was louder than ever. Then all of a sudden it went quiet. We stayed up another hour or so before we decided to turn in for the night. We put some more wood on the fire and got in the tent and got ready to sleep. Then it started again. It lasted about ten minutes then went quiet  but then it really got scary. The light from the fire was pretty bright and showed through the tent. We were both hugging our deer rifles  wondering what would happen next. All of a sudden we both saw a shadow come between the fire and the tent. It moved slowly and was very large. Then as quickly as it started it ended. The next morning we searched the area for foot prints but were unable to find any. What we did realize was that our pickup was parked right near the spring and there was a very large log that had not been there the day before. We figured maybe whatever it was didn  t like the pickup so near to the only water in the area. It was a very dry year and all the natural springs in the area were dry  so this was the only water for miles. I have hunted this area for the last 25 years and I have back-packed in the back country all my life. I have heard just about every animal that  s out there  but I have never heard anything like what we heard that night. So what do you think? Did we have an encounter with one of the big guys? Sure would like to hear what you think. Thank you. , ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Fall ,6089,no
318,While living with my parents at Manton  CA. in 1987-1989  we began hearing strange howls intermittently from about 9 PM to midnight 2-3 times a week. My father said their crazy neighbor must have gotten hold of a WW 2 air raid siren. I think he said that so as not to scare kids. It was definitely NOT the local volunteer fire dept. siren.  Not until several years later did we happen to hear a recording of the  Ohio howl -- exactly the same sound. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end to recognize it. My husband and grown children also recognized it and said  That  s the sound we used to hear at Manton!  Looking back  I realize the sound came from the cleared swath going up the hill along the penstock or the powerlines. At the time  not many people lived in the area  lots of wildlife that just came into yards  game  cougars  water.  ,Bottom of Wilson Hill Rd.  west of Volta Powerhouse site. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,no
319,Back in the summer of 1990 (I cannot recall the exact date)  I was on a camping trip with my girlfriend. We had set up camp earlier that day and were getting ready to start cooking some dinner. I  m not sure of the exact time but it was just before nightfall. We were not camped close to anybody because for some reason the campgrounds were empty. I think the nearest people were a family that were camped about 300 feet away. Suddenly  about the time when we were about to eat we heard a loud howl. I call it a howl because I don  t know how else to explain it. We both looked at each other and I said to her   What the hell was that?  I  d say it was about 1 mile away  but I  m not sure. I do know that whatever made that sound was big. The sound we heard that night has the same characteristics as the  howl  recording on this website. The similarities are almost exact. ,Burney Falls near Shasta in Northern California ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,no
320,Honeymoon trip August 1991. Stopped at roadside rest between Redding  Ca. and Mt. Lassen. Wife felt ill in middle of night  walked her to restroom to throw up. While wife was in restroom I heard local dogs going crazy barking  etc. This barking was silenced by a yell that I  ve only heard on documentaries about bigfoot  but it is totally different live. After this yell  there was nothing but silence and my poor wife getting sick. I went back to the van and drove back topick up my wife. I told her I was just getting it warm for her  but she seemed to sense my aggitation. I convinced her nothing was wrong and we went back to sleep. I kept it to myself until morning. When I told her she didn  t believe me. I saw nothing and smeld nothing  but I have never heard so much noise silenced so quickly. , ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,yes
321,I was living in a pretty nice subdivision at the time. It wasn  t overly remote  just a typical subdivision  it was located on a large green belt  and there was a lot of construction being done on expansion of the subdivision at the time. The area was primarily oak trees  and poisen oak  scrub brush  manzanita  etc. I was sitting shooting the bull with a friend outside on the curb. directly across the street a house was under construction. We had been talking for quite awhile  when we hear VERY frightening screams. They sounded similar to sounds I have heard on bigfoot recordings  and very much like nothing I had ever heard before  very loud  and very erie. I hadn  t ever heard certain animals scream before  so I honestly don  t have a base of comparison. We never left  we just sat there sort of freaked  because it WAS a subdivision (albeit at the end of a street) and because we didn  t know what it was. I figured maybe a fox  because I had seen the fox in the area in the days preceeding  and day of the even  strangely  I never saw the fox after that night). I am skeptical about what it was that made the noise  I don  t think it was the fox  although  I haven  t heard them yelp. I haven  t heard owls before  but never have seen them in the area. It did scare me  and I haven  t forgotten it  even though it was about 8 years ago.  An interesting side note  there was a dead kitten in my gutter in the morning  near where I sat  And another kitten limping nearby  I hadn  t seen the kittens around prior to the day either.  The noise best sounded like something in a horror movie to scare the crap out of you. ,off 273 north to El Reno-To Howard-To Frances Dr. to the end. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Unknown ,6089,no
322,After midnight in the fall of 1992 up in Burney CA  my mother comes and wakes me up to listen to a noise she just heard outside. I walk out to our porch and wait for about 5 min. It is pretty cold out side so I  m about to go in side when I heard something that made my skin crawl  and my hair stand on end. The sound was very gutteral in nature  It sounded like chirpping and then it went into a scream that sounded like a cougar bear howler monkey rolled into one. It is really hard to explain the sound. I have heard it before on bigfoot documentaries since then. I went out to search for what made the noise and didn  t see anything but there was a punget odor in the air.  At the time I did not associate the two. I went back inside. The next morning our next door neighbor complained that someone was outside her window last night. She said her window shades were drawn but could see the silhouette of a head and shoulders. I asked her to show me what window it was. It was her back bedroom window that is at least 6-7 ft off the ground. The ground under her window was packed hard clay and there was no foot prints or anything. ,Head west on 299 turn south on Hudson St. My apartment was located nearby. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Fall ,6089,yes
323,I believe that i saw bigfoot  with two other witnesses in the vehicle with me.  I seen a huge ape like animal that was reddish brown color  with long straggley looking hair hanging off it  s arms  and legs.  I also noted as it walked  its legs at the knees were bent as it walked its legs never straightened out like a humans legs would. The arms of this bigfoot were long and swayed as he walked and he was very tall  i noted that he walked next to a tall sign on the highway and his shoulders were in line with the 55 mile speed limit highway sign on hwy 299. I would also say that this creature was around 7 to 8 foot in height  and about 500lbs  or more in weight. ,Location was the last hill going south on 299 to Burney  and i remembered also as we observed this creature it did not look back at us  and it was walking in front of us on the opposite side of the road next to a tall caltrans 55 mile speed limit sign.  A approaching car almost hit the creature as the car was coming down the hill. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Fall ,6089,yes
324,I have seen Bigfoot two times. The first time was one summer in the late 1970s. My friend and I were camping in the Tahoe National Forest in California. We were camping out of a station wagon  as we did not have a tent. My friend was cooking on the Hibachi  and I was sitting on the tailgate of the station wagon watching him. We were in a newly planted area of seedling pines. The surrounding that area was old growth pine trees. I looked over at the old growth area and there stood Big Foot. He was about 5   tall  and hairy all over. His eyes were large as if he were use to living in darker environment. I told my friend to turn around slowly  and look  as he did the Bigfoot melted out of sight back into the forest.  After we had gone to bed for the night around 2 00 AM in the morning  something hit the station wagon so hard that it rocked back and forth. Scared me half silly. The windows were clouded inside with moisture  and the night was dark.  The next time I saw Bigfoot  I was at Lake Shasta in the late 1990s. Wayne  Ginger the dog  and I were bass fishing on the lake  and the weather was warm. On the shore was Bigfoot walking down towards the water. When he got there he swooped his left arm down into the water as if he were checking a trap to see if there were any fish in it. He stood up and walked up the steep hill without any effort.  He was huge.  From the boat he appeared to be at least 7 to 8 feet tall. He had long shaggy hair  very dark brown. While all of this is going on Ginger the dog was going berserk. She was running around the boat yelping and howling. I told Wayne there is Bigfoot. He did not see him. The place where we had launched the boat was in the Jones Valley Resort area. When I tell people I have seen Bigfoot  and they think I am crazy. I  m not. Cousin Bob went out fishing with Wayne not too long after that. He said he saw something also. He said he didn  t know if it was a turkey hunter in disguise or what  but it walked up the steep hill with no effort. ,The Lake Shasta sighting was up the Pit River arm of Lake Shasta  which is East of the Jones Valley Resort. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,yes
325,I live in Redding Calif.  My incident occurred while I was hunting in Round Mountain Calif.  about 25 miles from Redding.  I was rifle hunting for deer in zone C1 on Roseburg land and had been up in that area for about three months scouting archery and at this time rifle.  My friends and I had camped up in this area off and on all this time  but on this day I had went to the mountain myself since my friends were done hunting for the year due to not seeing any bucks.  I however thought I would give it one more try.  It was late Sept 2000 early morning around 7.00 am and I was driving up a dirt road that I had been up and down many times before when I noticed a very old skid road covered in bush.  I knew that there was a large draw behind the bush because I could see just the top of it  so I parked my truck and started to walk up the skid road. There was a small creek on my left as the bush started to clear and I could see up the draw so I stopped to hunt for a while. At this time I was about 150 yds up the old road standing by the creek.  I looked down to the dirt on the creeks side and saw what looked a lot like a persons footprint but immediately knew better this track was easy 17 long and 6  wide. ,Hwy 299 East Round Mountain  CA.

327,On 8-9-01 we were staying in a small cabin 9 miles from the Lassen Park entrance  about 2 miles from Viola on Highway 44.  My  wife woke me up as she heard a strange screaming-like sound.  I was immediately awake and heard what can only be described as a scream-like call that repeated itself.  It lasted about 25 seconds and was quite loud but seemed to be at least a half mile or so past our 20-acre spot  which is on a creek. I really didn  t give it much thought although I knew it wasn  t a mountain lion  bear or owl.  A few days later I mentioned it to a friend as the sound was so otherworldly and hard to describe.  He suggested and I rather skeptically checked a few bigfoot sites and was amazed to hear the same exact sound that had been recorded at different places in Nothern California and Oregon. It certainly doesn  t sound like anything else. Can  t say it was bigfoot  but the sound is exactly the same. ,Two miles west of Viola of Highway 44 (Near Lassen  9 miles west of Shingletown) ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,no
328,It was about 3AM at Lake McCumber  California. I was with my mom  aunt and uncle  and my uncles son and daughter in law. My uncle and his son stayed up all night listening to the strange noise that was somewhere in the meadow. They had no idea of what animal it was  I did. I had heard this noise before. I woke up my mom who didn  t want to hear it at all. I bet that the nieghbors across the meadow seen the creature  or at least heard it more clearer than us.

329,Here  s what I encountered on 4/19/2003  at least the best that I can remember; at the Jones Valley Campground  Lake Shasta  CA. It was about 22 00  slightly over cast and very calm and quiet. In hindsight I remember how odd it was for it to be that quiet on a Saturday night on Lake Shasta. Not even insects were making any noise.I had been sitting in front of a small  almost-out fire for some time when I heard a large tree branch break about 50 yards away. It was sort of an instant   pop   sound and the branch never hit the ground. Initially it startled me but after about 10 minutes I had just written it off as one of the normal noises that the woods make at night. Then I heard another branch break in the same fashion maybe 10-15 yards from where the first had been broken  again never hitting the ground. Within a minute or two I heard approximately 10 to 13 VERY heavy footsteps heading more or less in my direction. Then after a few more minutes had passed I heard another branch break about 10 yards from were I was. I woke up one of the other fellows that were camping with me and told him something was coming up on us and I had no idea what it was. We then heard about 3 or 4 more footsteps and that was it. My friend took up refuge in the camper at this point. I didn  t see anything as it was very dark and whatever this was was in an area of trees. I have been camping in the woods since I was a very young boy and have encountered just about every type of animal there is  at least in California. This was definitely walking on two feet. I  m confident that it was not a bear because they generally don  t take very long strides when they stand on two feet. Furthermore most of the bears that I have encountered in this region are black bears and not very large. I  m submitting this in hopes for an explanation.  Was it a deer in season or a rabid bear or what I don  t know  I  m at a loss. ,An undeveloped campground in Jones Valley  on the way into Jones Valley Resort. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Spring ,6089,no
330,Hi  my Name is [L. D.] I am 56 Years old and live in Redding California. Last Saturday evening on January 7  2006  my wife and I drove from Redding to Shingletown about 26 miles east of Redding to see a puppy that we wanted to buy. It was a very dark night with fog like clouds low to the ground  so I had to pay very close attention to the road.  About 6 miles past Shingletown there is a stretch of road that is straight. About 300 feet up the road from the car  I saw this thing walking across the road.  It looked very tall with big long arms. It had a very large walking stride. It walked like it knew a car was coming  because it went up the side embankment of about 12 to 15 feet. I am just a normal man and I know what I saw.  This is not to far from Lassen Park. ,Start from Redding  California  Go HWY 44 East just past Shingletown  California. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Winter ,6089,yes
331,I was on a family camping trip. There were a lot of us. I was 13 at the time and I had never heard of Bigfoot. The way our camp was laid out was that all of us girls (two sisters  their friends and a friend of mine) were all staying in one big army tent. My brother and his friend were in a smaller tent off to the east closer to the drop off to the lake. Then my parents were in their own tent at the far west end of the campsite. There had been a lot of trouble with bears that summer so all campers were advised to hang their food high up in the trees. My Dad did that and I remember him standing under the bag of food a good three feet over his head about 10 to 15 feet from the door to our tent to the left. My Dad was 5  10 . As for myself  I really wanted to see a bear. I was a very outdoorsy kid and would have preferred to sleep outside of the tent actually. I had little fear of the dark  or the night  and it was my goal to see a bear. I am quit sure we were there for two weeks that year and as I remember it  my sighting occurred about a week in to being there ... since I spent several days after that looking for traces of what I had seen. I slept closest to the door and somewhere during the middle of the night I heard a little stirring outside. Everyone else was asleep and I didn  t wake anyone since I had already been informed (emphatically) that no one else wanted to see a bear. I very quietly and carefully crawled to the door of the tent and cautiously stuck my head out the door. I looked over to where the food bag was hanging and saw something that was unquestionably NOT a bear. What I saw was two dark hairy creatures just standing there under the food bag like they were negotiating how to get it down or something. One of them was a good foot taller than the other. My Dad would have come to the bottom of chest of the biggest one. They were just huge! The smaller one was probably just a head taller than my dad. I had that as a gauge after all since I had seen my Dad standing there in the very same spot under the bag  and he hung the food bag in the same place every night. They were VERY tall and very upright. I had never heard of a Bigfoot at that time  but I knew these were not bears. Bears are pear shaped and standing upright isn  t a position of comfort for them. For that matter  they don  t just   stand   next to each other like they are carrying on a conversation. The incident took place very quickly. It was fast  but I was VERY impressed and it was clear to me immediately that I was seeing something extraordinary. What happened was that as I saw them  and saw that they were something unexpected  I did one of those surprised intakes of breath ... a true   gasp   I guess you could say. They heard that and both turned and looked at me. Then  they turned and looked at each other  looked back at me again  and then ... they were just gone. They made not a sound. One moment they were there  and then they were not. I did not go out of the tent. I did think about it  but ... I laid awake all that night thinking about it. I had absolutely no idea what I had seen. The next morning the first thing I did was go out in the direction I saw them leave to see if I could find tracks  but the earth was very hard and dry there. I didn  t see anything. It might be that someone more skilled than I was at the time might have found some trace  but I didn  t. I did spend a goodly amount of the remainder of that vacation watching and walking in the woods. I recall I even passed on water skiing a few times to go search the woods. I didn  t tell anyone what I saw until a few years later. I told NO ONE at the time. I was the youngest in my family and already endured a considerable amount of teasing on a regular basis ... you know  kid stuff. I was not about to tell anyone I saw a 7 foot (or so) tall hairy man creature in the campsite. It would not have gone well. Oh  what I saw of them ... Hairy  with long hanging brown to black hair. I didn  t catch any gender features. I just assumed the smaller one was female  but I have no reason to think that since I was mostly just seeing their height ... and the fact that they looked at me ... they LOOKED at me. Uh ... there just aren  t words. I did catch that the arms were quite long and they were very big in the chest  shoulders and upper arms  not so much in the hips.  Nope these were not bears at all. I do not recall if there was any strong scent associated with my sighting. I didn  t know what I saw until a year or so later when I saw a picture of the famous movie footage. I was so excited to see something that looked like what I had seen. I am 49 now ... I will never forget. ,This was at the McCloud Campsite on Lake Shasta. It was before I knew how to drive so I do not recall highways and such. I have no idea if McCloud is still there. It was pretty popular then though  but not over corwded. For all I know it could be a huge hotel and casino by now ... I hope not. It was quite rustic at the time I was there in 1970. ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,yes
332,In early June 1991 French Gulch  CA. My son and I took a short vacation to my childhood memories trip area to French Gulch where I remembered an eerie thing that happened back in the mid 60  s with my father. I had lived with my grandparents in an small town called Summit City just a few miles below Shasta Lake Dam when my father one day took me to French Gulch way way back deep into the woods North and North East of the French Gulch town. I remember always feeling as though being watched and sometimes herd really eerie sounds. I remember the eerie sound that made this worse for me to be comfortable. I was a naturalist though and always felt drawn to the deep woods and so it was hard to keep me from it. In latter years after retiring from the U.S. Army I took a trip visiting relatives in Redding  and one evening I packed up the truck for an deep adventure back to those woods and was their mostly to get those big pine cone  s with delicious pine nuts. We left late that evening  getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin. It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldnâ€™t see how far. Then after about three hours of this turn and that and many miles I had forgot to count  and my son fell asleep; I became tired and stopped. I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up. I had a camper shell on the little Plymouth arrow Pickup and could lock ourselves in for the night when time came. Before I stopped  I just happened to turn the truck around on the road as it made it easier to load some of the pine cones and as I got out beginning to loading more pine cones  that is when I heard that noise and it was very close. I was petrified at the sound as it is nothing like the elk calls that sound a bit eerie too. I began to slowly pick up a few more pine cones as these were only for decorating for our Christmas seasons and as in my childhood days  I would get the green ones that made it from last autumn and were still on the pine trees as I was still the tree climber. I had reached down to pick up the fifth pine cone and it was then I just froze up and full of panicky fear. I could hear up the side of the ledge  ridge  to my right clearly a heavy pounding of what sounded like something very large. Only two distant sounds pounding the ground and the damn thing was coming fast. I dropped the pine cones at once and ran up to the driverâ€™s side fumbling in fear with the door trying to get in the truck. Then I started the truck up and was trying to put it into 1st gear and jammed it in just as I let out the clutch awaking my 7 year old son. I had heard the sound coming down behind the right rear of the truck just before I got the truck started. I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck. The moon and the stars were out which helped me see this figure form as well. I had been stricken with such fear that I had never known before at this moment and nearly drove off the side of the road when my son said  â€œDad  watch out !!â€. I then nearly flipped the truck over  just missing a small log. I had no gun with me.  I would have not feared what this was  and would have shot in the air as a warning or at it if I had to. It was that darn eerie sound and the sound of the thing coming down the steep hillside  and at that second the issue of absolute fear of not having any defense  that got my spirit stirred. I knew for sure it wasnâ€™t a bear  as that memory is still just as plain to see today. It took a while before my son got me to say what happened on the way back as I was barrowing down the mountain as fast as I could  and am surprised I didnâ€™t forget each turn I had to make on the roads I chose going out on the way back. We just pulled into French Gulch when daylight was breaking and I had to stop and sleep for an hour or so when my son woke me up whining about being hungry.  I woke up a bit dazed and it came back to me what had happened and I started up the truck and headed back for Redding.  My son was teasing me  â€œOh dad it was probably just a bearâ€. We reached Uncle Bills place on the right side of the road well before Redding where he lived on some property of his brothers wifeâ€™s Father; an Italian whom passed away. Still to this day my son teases me at his age 23. I was a ranch care taker a few years back in Flagstaff  Arizona  and I had seen a lot of things and heard a lot of things  but nothing that could ever compare to what I experienced on that early morning above French Gulch  and I surely didnâ€™t want to.  I always carried a gun with me on that ranch just the south side of Rodgers Dry Lake even in the surrounding woods. Their were signs posted before entering that forest North of French Gulch stating to keep out during the evening (Night) and cut firewood only during daylight hours.  I hadnâ€™t been their for so many years and wanted to experience what I remembered as an teen  but I sure wouldnâ€™t have if I had known what I would have encountered that night. Iâ€™m very serious  because I  ve studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since  and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture  but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection. I have never herd of where this big beast has come up on some one like me and acting like it did  but it sure did with me. I hope someone does get some physical evidence because I havenâ€™t enjoyed being teased all these years; also we could put an end to the mystery of this beast. I  ve known what it was like to have big bears visit at night up in the high country of the Colorado Mountains  Rabbit Ear Mountain-Pass area  where I camped with wife and our first born.  Iâ€™ve been around the world and seen a lot of things from the mountains in West Germany and in South Korea in the Ming Dung Mountains where the Siberian tiger still remained back in 1975. In all those years I have never had such a scare. My body and hands were trembling and I was scared down to the core of my being. Sincerely  Sgt. M.L.D.

333,Three friends enjoying an all day ride up to the snow in Whiskeytown National Park. We were all on horseback. We spotted what appeared to be Bigfoot tracks in the snow. We got off our horses for close examination and could clearly see the toes in the snow. Two of the witnesses are RN  s. I am an Appraiser. What made this sighting of tracks credible to me were the existence of so many other tracks  including bear  that gave good comparison to other critters and size.  The tracks came up out from the gulch  followed the road a bit  then back down into the gulch. Also my friend noticed smaller Bigfoot tracks coming down from a very steep draw on the left of the road. There were no tracks going up  just coming down  as if to  join  the others. It was still very cold when we first saw these tracks  but they were melting when we rode back through this area many hours later. ,South side of Whiskeytown Lake  Whiskeytown National Recreation Area.

334,This happened back around 2014 although I didn  t realize it until I read something about it. I was on Shasta Lake riding my Sea Doo one last time before I sold it. I had headed up the Pit river sometime in July. It was approximately sometime after 2 PM.  I had gone up quite a ways up toward the pot river and had decided to head back toward Jones Valley resort.  I always love to scan the ridges looking for shapes like you do when you hunt.  I came around a big  turn in the main channel and it was the most bizarre thing I had ever seen. About 20 feet from shore I see what I initially believed to be a big hairy head with eyes staring directly at me. I would say within a couple seconds it simply disappeared under the surface of the water. I was wearing sunglasses and I remember thinking  did I just see what I think I did?  I gave it a wide girth and slowed down and circled the area for about 2-3 minutes. I remember feeling freaked out a bit having this vision of it lunging out of the water at me.  Shortly after I continued back to Jones Valley resort and tried to put it out of my head. I wish now more than ever I would have taken the time to search for it but I just figured my initial thought had to be incorrect. I reasoned naturally it had to be something else. A beaver? Muskrat? I can  t say for sure what it was but I know it was big. I do know my original feeling was it was a big hairy head and face with eyes. It had appeared to be wet already like it had already submerged previously. It was dark brown and tan in color. I know it was not a human. There were no boats anywhere near where I was and it was pretty secluded. , ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,yes
335,This happened on my way to work last summer a few days after the Delta Fire broke out and the Carr Fire was about to connect with Delta Fire. I was driving up to work from Redding. I worked at a school in Whitmore  California  in Shasta County  that was only accessible from a logging road. As I was going up the mountain  I rounded a corner and about 300 feet from me and maybe 400 feet front tintagel lane  a tall hairy creature  dark brown with some gray along the back shoulders  walking on two legs  crossed the road (which is wide enough for 2 cars to pass each other) in about 2 steps and then was in the woods. The hair on the back of my neck instantly stood up  and I was terrified. I had my 11 month old son in the back seat  and I drove to campus as quickly as I could. Several of my co-workers on that campus have had experiences as well. ,Happened about 400 feet from Tintagel Lane in Whitmore California ,Shasta,27,California ,CA,Summer ,6089,yes
336,This happened mid July 2022.  My name is John. I am a 66 year old man. My wife and I are finally retired and planned on going camping for a week at a time. We have been wanting to go up to north Battle Creek and fish for a lot of years. We have fished it in the past but we wanted to stay for more than a day at a time.  I have been a hunter my hole life. I hunted deer  bear  pig and have have filled my tags every year. So I know how animals react to different situations. And I can identify all species. Due to health reasons we had to wait until early July to make our first trip. We made reservations to get the camping spot we wanted which was closest to the lake. It was hell waiting for the day to come. The day we left was mid July. It was only a two hour trip from our home in Northern California to north Battle Creek. We left about ten in the morning. The road going in there was a dirt road about nine miles back in the woods. We didnâ€™t see any wildlife on the trip in. Which I thought was strange. But when we drop into the valley where the lake was I told my wife and oldest son Shane that we were dropping in to Sasquatch valley. This was on a Sunday and people were leaving. So there was only a few people still camping. We found our camp site and set up. It was so beautiful there. It was in the 100s at home when we left and only 85 at the lake. Wow  what a relief. The day was so nice we stayed in camp that day and put our kayaks at the boat ramp .  We have a very good dinner that night and turned in right after dark. On Monday their was only one other group camping besides us. They were about 80 yards away. I got up around 4 30am and sat around the camp until it was light enough to see. I got my gear and walked down to the lake put my things in my kayak and took off. The fishing was great. I got my limit. I was the only person on the lake. About 10 30 I headed back to camp with my catch. Everyone was up and I told my son to go clean my fish (family joke). We sat around the rest of the day talking and enjoying the beautiful day. We saw some cows at the east side of the camp ground. But didnâ€™t think anything of it. The day was very uneventful. We had dinner which wife is a great cook and went to bed. It was nice and cool at night in the 50s. Tuesday morning comes I am up again at 4 30am. I was sitting at the table when I heard a very load yell or howl. I could not come up with what it could have been. Everyone else was still asleep so when It was light enough I walked down and took off fishing in my kayak. As I was fishing I started hearing more yells or howls coming from the west side of the lake. Then I heard it from the north side of the lake. Then I heard a lot coming from the east side of the lake. I must have heard ten different yells or howls that morning fishing. I went back to camp after it all stopped with my limit of trout. When I got back to camp my wife was up and I asked her if she heard the yells or howls and she said she did and said it was the black angus cows. But it didnâ€™t sound like any cow I have ever heard. This was different. So I sat down and told my son  when he got up  hey  clean those fish. Well first he is not a boy he is 49 and 6â€™1â€ 245 pounds of muscle no fat at all. He heard the sound also and didnâ€™t think it was a cow.  He is the oldest of nine boys. He had his dog with him her name is Penelope. She is a little dog about ten pounds. Late at night the people at the other camp started to make a lot of noise yelling and fighting. They threw everything in their trucks and left very very early. My son said he couldnâ€™t tell what was going on over there. But when I got up they were gone. We talked about it all day because it didnâ€™t sound right. The rest of that day was normal. Nothing else happened until it got dark and we went to bed. Then it became a epic night of biblical proportions. A night that will live in infamy in my sons mind. We all went to bed that night and he got in his sleeping bag and was reading a book. Me and my wife fell to sleep quick. But not long after we fell asleep his dog started to shake and she was growling low. Thatâ€™s when Shane heard something very big walk up to his tent fast and stop then walk half way around it. He yelled get out of here. What ever it was walked a way fast and very heavy.  He said it sounded like a very big man with over size boots on and very heavy and on two legs. He said when it walked up he had his reading light on and when it stopped at his tent he very slowly turned his light off. Before he yelled. A few minutes later he heard his dog growling again and start to shake again. He heard the heavy footsteps and again it stopped at his tent then walked around it. He pumped himself up to confront who ever it was. When he was pumped up enough he jumped up and run out of his tent with his book light and his book in his hand to confront who ever it was. He turned his light on and shined his light about all of three feet but there was no one there but he could hear it walking away again. He yelled for me but I didnâ€™t hear him. Now he was getting very worried it could see him but he couldnâ€™t see it. So he got back in his tent and zipped up the door this time. A few minutes later it started to come back again his dog was shaking again and growling. It came again to his tent and stopped. He sat there listening. It walked around his tent then walked off again. The rest of the night he tried to listen to see if it would come back but finally fall asleep. I woke up at 4 30 and went fishing again nothing looked any different. I didnâ€™t know what had happened that night yet. So I went fishing and got my limit and came back to camp about 8 30. My wife was up so I had coffee with her. When my son got up a few minutes later he had a very weird look on his face. He started to walk around his like he was looking for something. I helped him look for tracks but only found some deer tracks about 30 feet away. So I told him he has more fish to clean. Then he started to tell us about what had happened last night. I told him I didnâ€™t hear anything. We talked about it all day and I told him it couldnâ€™t be a deer they walk slow and quiet. It wouldnâ€™t be a bear they walk slow and would have went to the kitchen for food and if you scared them they most likely not come back that quick. I told him you must have had been a Bigfoot visit you. Dam and I missed it. He didnâ€™t believe in Bigfoot before that night but now he is starting to. I have never seen him so scared as he was when he came out of that tent in the morning he must have been shitting twinkies all night. After that night we didnâ€™t see any more cows until Friday night when people started to come back in camping. But the next night on Wednesday night I figured on scaring him a little so I put fishing line on the back of has tent then ran it to my trailer door hooked to a stick. That night I got up at 12 30 and started to pull the line but he was asleep all ready so I went back to bed. A few minutes later something walked between my trailer and his tent and I heard the stick hit the door . Then it must have stopped and backed up a bit because the stick hit the floor and made a noise.then it started to walk again and the stick hit the door again.and broke.The next morning I went to pick up the line and it was way over behind my trailer not even close to where I had  I figure it was after the fish heads my son had put in the fire pit. The rest of our trip was as normal as could be. But when I got home I started to look up Bigfoot sounds YouTube and I found that exact one. It was 16 sounds of Bigfoot in the Serras  the 7th sound. So I went up to our corner store and was telling the lady that works there her name is Lisa what had happened. And she said the same thing had happened to her 5 years before in the same place. My neighbor had something happen to him up there too. So I hope you can make sense of all this . You can use our names I am not afraid of what people think.

337,On my web page I describe the UFO sighting I had a little more than two years ago. I also mention that Bigfoot had been seen in the area a few weeks previously (about four weeks  actually). Well  I tracked down the newspaper article I remembered reading about the Bigfoot sighting  here it is  [Editor  s note  see related media article below.] (Note  this should not be construed as an attempt to link Bigfoot and UFO  s or promote any sort of underlying connection between them. I think it  s a sheer coincidence  *if* the Bigfoot sighting did occur.) The fact that the  two main umbrella organizations for logging and lumber companies in Oregon  (which are not named) may indicate a hoax. Then again  they may just not have heard of this particular lumber camp. On the other hand  as Bob Pyle observes in   Where Bigfoot Walks    it would not seem to be in the interests of the timber industry to promote interest in Bigfoot  a species which if proven to exist (and proven to be endangered) could complicate logging efforts  to say the least. , ,Sierra,3,California ,CA,Spring ,6091,no
338,3 of us went out to the woods to get away. We arrived at this loation about 3 00am.  About 30 minutes later we heard a rustling in the bushes. We passed it off as a harmless critter. A couple seconds later we heard a blood curdiling bellow-scream-screech  and we flipped our lids. As we began to run to the car  something that resembles what most people call bigfoot took off into the woods. ,Take the  farad  exit off I-80 eastbound on the way to Reno NV ,Sierra,3,California ,CA,Summer ,6091,no
339,We had driven from the San Francisco Bay Area to Sierra County for a camping trip.  When we arrived  our usual campground was full and we went to a less popular campground which was a few miles further down the road.  By the time we arrived it was already dark and we hurried to set up camp for the night.   Our intention was to camp at this campground for the night and look around the surrounding area for a better site closer to the water the next morning.  Since we has children with us they had to go to the bathroom and my friend (who had spent his youth camping in the area and this campground) took the girls to the closest outhouse while my husband and I started setting up camp.  They came back and everyone was talking about how horrible the area around the outhouse smelled and we laughed saying it was close to end of season and about time to clean out the vault toilets.  Soon we finished setting up tents and unpacking the few things we would need for the night.  I decided I should visit the outhouse and my daughter (who had already been with our friend) said she would show me the way.  We set off down the trail and my husband decided to join us.  We walked down the trail slowly because it was very dark and I had only brought a small flashlight that I always keep in the jeep since we hadn  t fully unpacked.  The outhouse was located in an area that was about 10 feet below the trail from the campground.  My daughter finally found the trail down and I flashed my light down into this gullky to look for the outhouse.  I found the outhouse and also found two red eyes looking back at me.  The eyes which were reflected in my flashlight seemed to crouch down.  I  decided that I didn  t need to go to the bathroom after all andmade the decision to walk back to camp rather rapidly.  When we got back to camp my husband and friend decided to go back and look around with a better flashlight but found nother although both noticed that it didn  t smell as bad as it had before.  The next morning I got up and decided I had to go to the bathroom no matter what was there!  When  got to the outhouse I realized that the eyes I saw reflected back at me had stood about 7 to 8 feet off the ground.  Also on further investigation we found some small trees uprooted and pushed over in the outhouse area.  And most important of all  the smell was gone. ,We were in Ramshorn Campground in the upper campsite area. ,Sierra,3,California ,CA,Summer ,6091,yes
340,I was working as a councilor at wilderness summer camp based at Mosquito Lake. Several councilors would sign up each session for excursions on  1 to 3 nights away in the back country. This hike was during the second session in early July. We had completed the major stretch of the four hour journey when we came over the ridge and could see East Boulder about 3/4 of a mile below. There were 4 councilors and about 25 boys and girls ranging in age from 9 through 15. We had stopped for a last gulp of water at a clearing just below the rim of the ridge when several of the campers began to squeal excitedly and pointing at the steep slope directly to the northeast and to the right of us. Not more than 50 feet away at the same elevation stood an erect hairy creature looking right back at us. One of the kids yelped   It  s a bear!  Tim  one of the councilors  muttered   That  s no bear.  The details are still vivin in my memory. The creature was leaning against its left arm which pushed it out from the canyon wall. The right arm swung back and forth as if for balance and it bobed its head irregularly. It was about 5  6  tall  covered with long reddish brown fur with a large flat face and round yellow eyes. During a discussion later  Sunny  who was studying biology at UC Davis  insisted that she observed the creature to have a hairless chest with large round protruding nipples. This led her to conclude that it was possibly female. The creature held its ground for a little over 1 minute before it spun around and ran away from out group upward towards the rim to the right of us. As it ran it sent a landslide of skree down into the valley below. When it reached the ridge it turned and peered back at us once again and then disappeared over the edge. Much excitement followed and the decision to continue down to the lake and set up camp was made. Curiously  there didn  t seem to be a trace of fear among the children although all the councilors  myself included  did admit later to being afraid. The first thing after dark that I noticed was a powerful odor that came from the Ponderosa grove. The closest comparison I can come up with is that the smell is skunk like but muskier with a hint of urine. The entire camp began to get a whiff of this odor and the animated discussion about the sighting during the afternoon became hushed. In the quiet we could hear landslides from a number of different places midway up the ridge  a dim green light about the size of a small grapefruit. The odor intensified and the snapping of branches not more than 10 yards away sent the whole bunch of us into a cluster around the fire. The odor was intense when a large shadow figure took several long deliberate strides through a gap in the trees. It had to be about 7 feet tall. I saw this creature only once but others in the group saw several dark forms over the next 2 hours. Shortly after midnight an 11 year old boy in the group began to complain of great pain in his lower abdomen. This pain increased over the next hour to the point that he was laying on the ground pulling his legs up towards his chest. The councilors agreed that it appeared that the camper was having an appendicitis attack. We drew sticks and Larry and Tim headed out in the dark back to the main camp to bring a stretcher with a four wheel drive truck to the logging road just over the south ridge. Sunny and I remained with the group  some of them sleeping and others tending the campfire. At the point when Tim and Larry  s flashlights were no longer visible  the odor departed as well and the night became still and quiet. The next morning shortly after dawm  Tim Larry and Warren  the camp director  arrived at the camp with a olive green military stretcher. Warren would later question every member of the group. He observed that the key elements of the story were consistent in each telling. He conceded that we had indeed experienced something strange but insisted that the concilors present agree to the possibility that what we had seen were bears. ,East Boulder Lake serves as a reservior for the city of Callahan.

341,Our family kept a bee yard near Mt. Shasta  on the old Oregon Trail.  One evening  after tending the bees  my father looked up towards the road home and saw a man standing near a stump of a tree.  Then he heard a sort of yip-yip-yipee sound  somewhere between a coyote and a cowboy roundup yell  but very loud.  Our old dog Queeny jumped into the car like she was scared.  The man-like creature took off  loping away in a slow run with it  s arms sort of hanging down.  When my dad drove closer to the stump later on  he realized that by the height of the stump and the height of the man or man-like creature  that it would have had to be much larger and taller than any normal man.  We believe it was  bigfoot.  ,There is a monument or marker near the dirt road where you turn off the main Hwy (about 10 mi. north of Weed).  I have not been there in a very long time. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Fall ,6093,yes
342,My husband was a teacher and had left for school.  Our daughter had just gotten on the grade school bus so it was after 8 00.  There had been no water so I took the two little boys 3 1/2 and 20 months and walked up the hill to clean the screen to the intake on the holding tank. This was taxing because I was 8 months pragnant at the time.  We had just gotten to the top and I was going to sit on a big tree stump.  The cat had jumped on it and immediatly arched her back hair on end and screeched.  I looked to see what she was looking at and there was this huge man like thing... It  s hair was long like a horses mane and   flowed  . It was all black that I could see. It first dropped down  and then got right up and ran uphill  zig zagging around branches as it went. I grabbed the two boys and ran down that hill so fast.  I could have gone a mile. My heart was really pumping. ,Our back yard... Mountain I should say. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Spring ,6093,yes
343,This was summer  1977  and I lived in Arcata  California working as a volunteer Botanist for Six Rivers National Forest. I was helping out a graduate student at Humboldt State University with his Master  s Project (we studied wildlife and plants associated with freshwater ponds in the forest near Willow Creek). One  weekend  my girlfiend and I drove up to the Salmon River to go camping. Its a remote area; it seemed that most people up that way were either miners along the river or fire crews. Near Forks of Salmon (town) we stopped and camped at a pullout near the mouth of the Little North Fork. The next day  we hiked up the stream  went swimming  (even saw a black bear on the trail) and later drove home. The following morning (Monday) my coworkers came to pick me up for the week  s work  but I realized while packing that I was missing the telephoto lens to my camera. I remembered using it on the Little North Fork photographing a frog. Figuring I had laid it by the stream and forgotten it  I did not join my two coworkers.  Instead I called my girlfriend  told her what had happened and asked if she would like to return to the Little North Fork. Instead of roaring up there and back (about 100 miles ?) we decided to make a backback trip out of it.  We got up there  hiked the trail  found the lens  but decided to drive further up the paved road to a spot somewhere near Sawyers Bar where a dirt road followed the North Fork and led up to a trailhead where hikers could further follow up the North Fork and into the Marble Mountain Wilderness Area. It was dusk  so we donned packs and got up the trail as far as we could before it got completely dark.  There were no obvious camp sites so we rolled out our bags and literally slept in the middle of the trail. Its old growth forest and we felt pretty alone. The next morning we got hiking again  following the North Fork up a long forested valley.  We passed one other couple that day who had stopped to swim and set up camp. We hiked on another four miles and the trail left the river; it snaked up along the side of the canyon and became more of a narrow path. Always the dirt beneath our feet was covered with the prints of bears.  There were no human shoe prints  just bear prints. It was getting late again and the topo map indicated a stream would cross the trail some distance ahead so we pressed on figuring to set up camp there. We soon heard water. At the crossing we were very tired and were ready to drop our packs  but we both had a very uneasy feeling about the spot and agreed we could  nt spend the night there. Consulting the map again  we found that the trail branched a little ways ahead and an unmaintained primitive path headed up the mountain to a small subalpine lake that we had earlier planned as our destination. The map showed the creek to cross the primitive trail shortly after the path left the main trail. We figured the trail junction might be a good place to camp since it would be close to the creek but hopefully without the feeling we experienced here. Soon we got there and found a small open area between the trees just off the trail  level and large enough for our sleeping bags and a fire.  We dropped our stuff and then went down the start of the primitive trail to the creek (20-30 yards). It was in a steep  boulder-choked  densely forested draw full of log jams left from spring or winter torrents. It was barely a creek now in mid-summer. It was getting dark and again we had a bad feeling about being dwon in the creek bed.  We hurriedly filled our cooking pots with water and got back up to our packs. We were tired.  After cooking  I remember arranging our pots and pans along a log on one side of us and the fire on the other side. I hoped if a bear entered camp during the night he might knock the pots off the log and thereby wake us up. Sometime in the middle of the night (I had no watch  but the fire was completely burned down to ashes and coals) I awoke to a terrible racket going on down in the streambed through the trees below us. It was the sound of logs and large rocks being hurled and crashing into things. I sat up in the dark and listened. I shook my girlfriend and told her to wake up. She at first buried her head in her bag and did  nt want to hear the sounds.  I was really scared. It was totally dark  I knew there was no one around for miles and I also knew that bears do not go rampaging around throwing things. I also knew darn well that anything living out there could probably smell the remains of our fire. Whatever it was was clearly spending a lot of energy either trying to scare us or angrily searching for something in one of the logjams. After listening for maybe 10-20 minutes (its really hard to know how long) my worst fears were realized. The crashing sounds stopped and soon there was the sound of footsteps coming up the slope directly toward us. It was on two feet and they were clearly audible  heavy footsteps. By this time my girlfriend was wide awake and sitting up in her bag like me listening. Although neither of us said it  we both were thinking of what it had to be. With the fotsteps came the sound of labored breath. Whatever it had been up to in the stream bed clearly had been hard work. I had a sheath knife  but standing to fight seemed out of the question  it was dark  this thing was big  and I was petrified. Just as it came up behind the trees immediately surrounding us  I flicked on my little flashlight  hoping to keep it at bay with the light. The light did not penetrate the darkness beyond the nearest trunks. The creature stopped just behind the nearest tree trunk (15 feet? away) and just stood there breathing. The sound of the breathing was at least seven feet up in the air. I yelled  Hey!  with as load a voice as my adrenalin could muster. The breathing paused momentarily and the creature made a  humph!  like sound in response  not to me directly  but more to itself. It was very careful to not reveal itself and used the tree to avoid my light striking him. After this  it turned and walked through the brush and trees directly away from us  not back toward the creek but parallel with the creek  heading downstream.  The stride was unhurried. We quickly built the fire back up and stayed awake until dawn. After the sun came up we got some sleep. After breaking camp we dropped down to the creek before heading up the path on the other side.  I looked around briefly to see if I could see what the creature had been doing  footprints  etc.  but I found nothing. I wish now I had gone down or upstream a bit  since the sounds may not have originated at the crossing like I assummed at the time.  We got up to Lake of the Isle (kind of a shallow cirque lake as I recall) in the afternoon.  There were some old campsites there but no recent evidence of people. The place was scoured of firewood  though. I spent a lot of time hauling wood up the hill so we would have enough to last all night.  I also stockpiled throwing size rocks. That night we could  nt sleep.  We would hear rustling in the brush near camp.  I would throw rocks in the direction of the sounds (probably racoons or black bears) and  build up the fire some more.  We did that all night until dawn. We fnally got some sleep.  When we awoke we both decided to bag it and hike out.  We packed our packs and hiked all day. The last mile or so to the car we hiked in late dusk; the thought of spending another night out there was out of the question. We were so paranoid by this time  we jogged the last half mile. That  s it for the incident.  Although we did not actually see the creature  neither of us have any doubt as to what it was. Up until that point in my life  Bigfoot stories were like the Loch Ness Monster  something intrigueing that you sort of wanted to believe in but could never be sure about. For me  the matter of Bigfoot  s existence was resolved that night 25 years ago.   ,Hike up the trail from Little North Fork Campground. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,yes
344,Dear BFRO  I had an interesting and very frightening experience back in 1984. I was backpacking with two friends in the Marble Mountains Wilderness in Siskyou County  Northern California. We were camped by a lake in the southern portion of the wilderness about 20 miles from the Klamath River east of Somes Bar and north of Fork of Salmon. It was just after dusk and we were settling down for the evening  having spent the day hiking and fishing. We heard the sound of a tree limb break about 50 yards from camp. At first we thought we heard a black bear attempting to steal our food  which was in a nearby tree hanging in a bear bag. When we approached the tree  a friend noticed two amber-colored eyes staring at us from the woods up the hill. The eyes were reflecting the light of his flashlight. We watched it and it watched us for about a minute. Assuming it was a bear or deer  I tossed a rock in its direction  hoping to scare it away. The eyes then rose vertically several feet  as if the animal stood up from a crouched position or reared up on its hind legs. Realizing this was a large animal  presumably a bear  we paused a moment and then I threw another rock at it. This time the creature began walking down the hill toward us on its hind legs  taking alarmingly large strides. I am an environmental engineer with a pretty good background in wildlife biology and had encountered bears many times in the past. I had never seen a bear walk on its hind legs like that - down a hill strewn with fallen trees and large rocks. This thing was very agile and moved quickly toward us. Alarmed  we ran back to our campfire to alert another friend. After a minute or two  my buddy again caught the eyes in his flashlight just outside our camp about 30 feet away - just outside the area illuminated by our campfire. The animal then proceeded to observe us for about 3 hours  circling our camp  but always remaining far enough away from the fire that we couldn  t clearly see it or photograph it. It took large strides on its hind legs and stood approximately 7 to 8 feet tall  judging by its height relative to trees it stood by. The thing kept circling around watching our every move and would not leave  despite our shouting and noise making. It was extremely unnerving because we were about 12 miles from our car in the middle of a very remote wilderness  in the pitch black darkness of night  with no weapons to defend ourselves. Had this thing attacked  we were more or less defenseless with no help for miles around. Interestingly  it kept its distance and was not really threatening us. It seemed more curious than anything else. I felt more or less like an animal being observed in a zoo exhibit. Usually  a bear will enter your camp and sniff out your food/kitchen. This creature kept its distance and remained walking on its hind legs the whole time  which bears do not do. The animal  s demeanor seemed more curious than menacing. The thing never made a sound  which would have helped us identify it or confirm our fears that it was not a bear and was indeed a bigfoot. In desperation  I threw some camping fuel on our fire  which released a huge ball of flame and a blinding flash of light. This must have scared the thing away  because when the fire subsided  it was gone. The next morning we checked for footprints  droppings  and any other sign that could indicate what it was. I suppose the hard  dry ground wasn  t suitable because we didn  t find any discernable tracks  which was really dissapointing. Thus  I can  t prove with photographs or casts of footprints that we really saw a bigfoot  but  aside from a large and very agile bear  I can  t explain what it was. This was a really intense experience and is the honest truth! My buddies and I have vowed to return to that lake with battery powered spotlights and better camera equipment again sometime and see if we enconter this creature again. Hopefully  if we are lucky enough to see it (or its offspring) again  we will get photos to prove it. I would very much like to see the scientific community officially identify and recognize this animal as a true North American species. I am no longer a skeptic. I would be happy to answer any further questions  see contact info below. , ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,yes
345,I was having a dream that I was being watched. My ex and I had thrown our mattress in the back of our truck  which sat about 1.5 feet lower than the canopy windows. The dream I had frightened me  because the face I was seeing was not human. I woke up in a sweat and happened to be facing the window in the canopy in time to see a large dark form moving away from the window  toward the front of the truck and out of my view. I sat up and cautiously peeked out of the canopy window to see this VERY LARGE dark  hairy figure moving quickly up the hill into the forest from the campground. It walked upright with the gait of a human  it moved through the trees giving me an estimate of it  s height at about 7ft. I remember loosing my scientific detachment at that time and as the  thing  disappeared further up the hill  I shook my ex awake and through a choked and somewhat hysterical description explained that I was very frightened. I couldn  t calm down  and he decided it would be a good idea to leave. We quickly got out of the back of the truck and noticed a very dank and musky smell. This scared me even further and we loaded our things and drove out of the camp. I wish I had been in a better frame of mind during the event  however the memory of the face I had seen  apparently in the half awake state( and still see in my mind) was not condusive to rational thinking. It was vaguely humanoid with large protruding brows  the eyes were dark and intense. The nose was a strange mixture of gorilla and human. The mouth was severe and somewhat turned down with fleshy lips. The facial hair was not on nose  eyes or mouth. The head was conical shaped  with a pronounced saggital crest. The jaw was not prognathic. Frankly  it scared the s*** out of me. I must state that I am a student of anthropology at Portland State University  and have never (outside of immediate family members) discussed this with my colleagues. I have always been fascinated with the  legends   but perhaps I never believed them truly until that moment. My family is amused by my story but think perhaps I just had a bad dream. Doubt it. ,On a return trip to Klamath Falls  OR from sightseeing in the Redwoods  my ex-husband and I camped on the outskirts of Klamath National Forest  north of Weed  between Goosenest and Herd Peak Mts. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Spring ,6093,yes
346,Sleeping under the moonlight without a tent  my wife and I awoke together -- completely awake -- during the night. I still don  t know the reason why we woke up  but we did.  We heard a  crunching  of the pine needles that sounded like footsteps. We sat up. We saw clearly by the light of the moon not more than 15-20 feet away between our campsite and the road something that was between 7 and 9 feet tall weighing between 450 and 600 pounds but closer to 500 pounds. It was heading down towards the lake in a direction from the manzanita area. It covered about ten feet in a stride and was swinging its arms in a human-like way. As it walked it seemed to glide over the ground  moving very elegantly. It appeared to have thick dark fur and to acknowledge us by turning its head toward us but didn  t slow. Its head seemed to be pointed at the top  but it was too dark to make out any facial features. As we watched it walk away  I don  t know if it was shock or some kind of unseen power causing us to just sit and watch. I turned to my wife and said   Did you see that?  She said matter-of-factly   Yes.   We laid down and went back to sleep. I don  t know why we weren  t afraid or curious enough to get up and follow its movement. If it were a bear or coyote  I  m sure we would have. But it was more like seeing a deer or elk in terms of our reaction. The next morning  I went over to where we had seen it and tried to follow the path it seemed to take from the manzanita down to the lake. I was unable to find any evidence  no footprints in the mud by the lake  no disturbed pine needles with moisture or dirt showing and no broken branches or hair in the manzanita. The area though at the edge of a forest reaching to the coast was also a frequently-visited tourist spot and not the sort of place I would ever expect to see such a thing. ,California  Shasta County  Castle Lake ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,yes
347,I was travelling down a couty road from a friends camp  and I was riding a small Honda motorbike.  I got past a turn and heard something akin to a flat tire flopping.  My bike is small enough that if it had a flat tire  I  d know it.  I was doing about 15 mph and looked back after going around a right-hand curve crossing a creek.  I saw what looked to be a hairy human figure  about 6-6 1/2   tall  running behind my bike.  Scared the crap out of me  so I hit the thottle and did what I could to get out of there. ,Moderate to steep incline on the lift after passing a creek  and moderately wooded.

348,I was sitting outside on the back deck of my ex girlfriend  s mobile home at  approximatly  12 00 A.M. enjoying a smoke before going to bed for the evening.  About five minutes after I went outside  I noticed a faint  but still very pungent  odor on the breeze. Kind of a cross between skunk  rotting carcass  & very dirty wet dog.  I  ve lived in the area all of my life  and hunted around the local hills and gulches  and have not encountered a smell quite like this before or since.  The smell came in on the breeze from the west of the trailer  up the hill from the property. I am a believer in the Sasquatch  having read  watched  and listened to as much information as I could get my hands on from the time I could read. About a week after the incident  I was working on a bicycle on the back porch  at about  10 00 or 10 30 P.M.  when I heard a low gutteral growl/hoot type noise  coming from behind me.  I would say from the volume of the noise  the critter that produced it was  maybe no more than 100 to 200 feet away.  That would have put the area it was in about halfway between our trailer  and the neighbor up the road.  Due to spending a considerable amount of time in the woods hunting  and just hiking around  I have encountered or heard just about all of the wildlife in this area  this sounded like nothing I have heard before.  The strange part of the encounter  was the fact that our German Shepherd Rottweiler cross heard nothing  nor did any of the other neighbor  s dogs.  I went inside to retrieve my handgun and a flashlight to check around the vicinity  but found nothing out of the ordinary.  However due to the time year the ground was way too dry to accept any tracks.  ,The property is about 3/4 of a mile to 1 mile west of town proper. just on the city limit line. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,no
349,I have two distinct incidences from 1997 and 1998 in the Klamath National Forest. The incident from 1997 was more of a Class B incident on the Klamath River directly off of Hwy 96. The incident in 1998 was during a solo backpacking trip in the Marble Mountain Wilderness where I hiked over 95 miles by myself. In 1997  I was working in the field conducting a survey to the National Forest users about federal land issues. It was an internship  and my field partner and I spent almost every night outside. The night of the incident was late summer  the second week of August. We had conducted the survey at a fishing and camping campground on the Klamath River and decided to go find our own camp for the night. We chose an undeveloped site just downhill from Hwy 96 that had nice sand bars along the Klamath River adjacent to a parking and picnic area. The parking area was situated between the river and the Hwy and was downhill from the hwy. The road and the river run parallel to each other here. Ben  my field partner  parked the car  and we grabbed our sleeping bags and a few items and went to crash for the night on the sand bars. Late that night  probably around midnight  we woke up to a large creature walking  actually limping  like a step  drag of foot  step  drag of foot  along the hillside below the road and above the river and us. It sounded like Eigor  but was definitely a two legged creature. We thought it was a person. It was limping along this slope that was covered in about 12 inches of oak leaf duff and the drag of the second (possibly injured) foot was loud through these leaves. Ben asked me if I could hear it  or was I awake. I said yes. I jumped out of my sleeping bag and grabbed a light and a knife. I shined the light up to the hill but could see nothing  and the movement on the hill stopped when I shined the light. I sat in my bag firmly gripping the knife with the light off. It continued to walk along the hillside coming closer to us. Suddenly  it reached a point on the hill directly above us and let out a gnarling  gutteral yelp. Not a scream  but a cry for help. Over and over again  this gnarled inward drone was very loud and continuous. Honestly  Ben and I could see nothing  and just sat there frozen. Waiting. We must have sat there waiting for over an hour  and the creature did the same. It was about 30 feet up the hill from us. Again  in honesty  Ben and I were not scared  and somehow  we both fell asleep. I think I relaxed finally  and just waited  and somehow fell asleep. I awoke some 20 minutes later to a huge splash in the river directly below the sand bars we were sleeping on. Across the river  the next day we could see nothing. No tracks in the sand  no tracks in the leaves  no nothing. We both agreed that it was not a bear  not a cougar  not even a human. There was only one explanation and it was sasquatch. In 1998  actually  I  m going to submit this one on the next one  because I think I  m close to 20 minutes.

350,In 1998  I was backpacking by myself in the Marble Mountain WIlderness in the Klamath National Forest the third week of August. The Klamath and the Marbles are particularly rugged and steep terrain. I hiked from Etna Summit at the PCT trailhead and looped all the way through the Wooley Creek drainage  attempting to get to the Cal-Salmon River. My attempt failed and I hiked to Little Elk Lake and on out to the group of lakes outside of Lovers Camp trailhead for the full distance. On day one I hiked over 14 miles on the PCT south from Etna SUmmit. On day two I left the PCT and hiked to a large marble outcropped ledge above the Wooley Creek drainage below a large  unnamed peak. (I can consult my map for a definite location  but do not have one available at this exact time). The night of my second day out  I slept on this nice marble ledge  beside a small creek about 2 feet wide that was more of an ice drainage from the steep  glacial peak above. This creek ran down the ledge and off a cliff that is about a 200 feet drop to a boulder field below and about 800 feet (or more) down to the Wooley Creek drainage. The 200 foot cliff below the ledge is VERY steep and to a tradational climber would be rated at least a 5.9 or 5.10 chaucy climb. So  there I was  in my purple Marmot bag  all cozy and tucked in. The night was clear and was about 4 days before the full moon in late August  so it was bright. I was sleeping parallel to the little brook running along the Marble Ledge and about 15 feet from its banks. I fell asleep and woke up to a wierd noise that was very far away. I was already frightened of animals because I was by myself. It does not matter  but I am also female. I was scared out there by myself. But having the time of a life. The noise so far away seemed to be way down in the forest in the Wooley Creek drainage. It was loud  however  almost like a yelling or a whooping. It was consistent and occured one yell after the other. I didn  t worry too much  and was not concerned because it was so far away. The yelling truly happened one after the other. And  it was getting louder and perhaps closer. I still was not concerned as it was far enough and I was atop a huge cliff  so I felt safe and unreachable. However  the yelling got louder and closer yet  and started to travel up the boulder field below. At this point  I had heard the yelling for 20 minutes. Again  it was a consistent howl  or whoop  over and over again. I just laid still in my bag and realized that not only was this yelling thing was coming up the boulder field but coming up the cliff. Sure enough the creature was climbing up the cliff. AND FAST! The whole event was this thing running and hooting/inward drone yelling up the drainage  up and up to the cliff and beyond to the top of the peak. Sure enough when it got to the cliff it pulled and climbed itself up  swiftly and agile  as I put in my journal. It literally dyno  d every move on this 5.9 cliff and yanked itself up the cliff to the top where the ledge was  where I was. The creature  in the mean time  was still consistently calling/yelping/hooting. It got to the ledge and started running toward the peak above. As it got closer  I pretty much urinated in my sleeping bag. But I just laid still; I was extremely frightened. As it started to approach the ledge close to where I was  on the other side of the brook  I could see it. It was a silhouette of a huge running gorilla. It ran on two legs but dragged and pulled with its arms. It was huge. The arms were almost the length of half its body and was covered in hair. It was black  but I really only saw a silhouette. The head reminded me of the abominable snowman from the Christmas  Rudolph movie. It just ran and howled  but then stopped slightly when it was parallel to me. It stopped howling  and slowed down slightly  and kind of hesitated. It turned its head toward me as if smelling something  but then immediately turned forward and really started running even faster. And louder and faster and then climbed up to the top of the peak and called and called for nearly four hours straight. Until almost sunrise. I stayed awake the whole time. I got up the next day and entered a short entry in my journal and packed up and continued on my journey. ,I can confirm the exact location at a later time when I access my map. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,yes
351,3 pm  weather was sunny & mild  my husband and two kids were fishing on the Klamath River in Siskiyou Co. It was very quiet  no birds were singing  even the range cattle were nowhere around. We had been fishing for at least a couple miles. We smelt a sour  wet dog smell; we looked around and saw him across the river by the brush just standing there. He was very huge; he wasn  t black but more like a dark brown. Hair seemed to be thick. The smell was pungent  that  s something I can  t forget. His/her hair covered the body. It stood there for a couple minutes  then crouched down and got a drink. We did not feel threatened by it. Up on the dirt road a loud jeep went by. I turned to look at the jeep  turned back  and he was gone. , ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,yes
352,It was a loud piercing sound  that lasted approximately 22 minutes. These sounds were at 5 to 6 second intervals which lasted about 4 to 5 seconds each. At first there was one distinct sound  (screaming) but then there was an additional  voice  that was louder and screamed longer. Each time the sounds would be heard  neighboring dogs would bark; then when the sounds stopped so did the barking. At the end of the 22 minutes (this occurred from 10 04 p.m. to 10 26 p.m.) it became extremely quiet and the barking also stopped. I have heard other sounds that weren  t near as  scary  as these sounds were. These were almost like a Halloween movie sound! Talked to the owners of the dogs  and they said their dogs were petrified after this incident. The dogs refused to come outside after hearing these sounds. ,Siskiyou National Forest  Gasquet  California near Highway 199. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,no
353,On or about March 4th  I had decided to take a drive up the inner-coastal (I-5) highway from Sacramento  CA to Portland  OR to visit some friends that I had not seen over the holidays. At approx 9 30-10 00 I stopped for gas in a small town just north of Redding  CA. I departed and continued heading north to Edgewood. I was searching for another exit  one with food  however I didn  t find one  so I exited and drove out about 1-2 miles on a paved highway that turned into dirt without warning. (Off Edgewood road). I pulled my car over  and got out some food I had taken incase I couldn  t find a restaraunt. I proceeded to eat  and take a short nap. I awoke about 1 30AM to the sound of something hitting my car from what I thought to be the front. I got out to look around and found a rock had hit my vehicle in the hood area. I found this very odd  and thought maybe some kids were playing around. I re-entered my vehicle  started it up again  turned on the lights  and to my utter surprise infront of me was a creature (for lack of a better term) just in the range of my headlights. Apparently it had been there watching me walk outside the vehicle and didn  t move or make a sound. It seemed uninterested in me  then suddenly turned and started to move away (left) into a small brushy area. I would have to estimate it at 7  0 to 8  0 tall  somewhat of a chocolate color  and very mobile for its size. It did not seem awkward by any means. I was not sure what to do  so I locked the doors and waited until I got my bearings together again. I got back on the highway and used my cell farther up the road to try and call CHP. When I reached them  I was unsure of how to explain this. I decided to call leter on when I knew exactly how to say what I had to say and not sound crazy. , ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Spring ,6093,yes
354,I Don  t Have A Personal Story To Relate  But I Felt Moved To Share A Sighting/Video Encounter Told By A Friend. Let Me Start By Filling In The Details. Last Weekend  A Group From Our Church  Went Up Into The Mountains  Near Graeagle  Ca. For A  Big-Boys  Camp-Out. Sitting Around The Fire At Night  The Subject Of Bigfoot Came Up. I Asked A Friend If He Believed In Bigfoot  He Said  Yeah   Then Told The Group This Story  He Told Us How His Friend  XXX  Had Gone Up To Marbel  Mountain Ca. With His Family To Camp. XXX Decited To Hike Around The Area Of His Camp  And Soon Came Across A  Hut  With A Big Doorway In Front  And A Smaller Doorway In The Rear. Upon Closer Examination  He Noticed That The Branches Used To Make This Hut  Were Way To Big To Be Broken  And Set Into Place By A Human. He Noticed That The Inside Of The Hut  Was Lined With Fresh Pine Neddles  And Sunken In The Middle Where Something Very Heavy Bedded Down. XXX Then Went Back To His Camp To Get His New Video Camera  And His Wife And Son. They Went Back Out To The Hut And XXX Began To Film The Hut  With His Son Going In Through The Doorway  And Out Through The Back Doorway  When His Son Said   Dad  There He Is  XXX Turned Around And Saw A Tall  Creature  On The Adjacent Ridge  With Arms That Hung Down By It  s Knees  Moving From Side To Side. The Bigfoot Seemed Confused  Wondering How He Was Going To Handle These Intruders  Checking Out  His  Hut! XXX Leaned Against A Tree  And Filmed About 5 Minutes Worth Of Video.

355,I was in a creeky wooded area outside of Dunsmuir  CA.  I was sitting high on a side of a large hill.  I noticed a bigfoot squatting down in the creek bed catching fish.  He/She was about 7 1/2 foot tall and very dark colored long hair.  From the distance I was at I couldn  t see its face.  The area was dead silent...

356,My story begins in the early part of June when I took a job at Josephine Creek Lodge.  My first sighting was on an after work excursion with my friend.  On June 16  2001  we went bouldering at a place known as House Rock.  When we arrived  we noticed four prints  three entering and one exiting the sheltered area.  They were approximately 16 inches in length.  The ground was sandy and you could see digits. On June 23  2001  my girlfriend came to visit this weekend.  On our day hike to Tri-Forest Peak the two of us found a print on the switchbacks  heading straight up.  Again  it was approximately 16 inches in length.  However  it seemed to be a bit wider than the previous prints found. One day after work  on July 27  2001  I was heading down to my campground at Big Flat when I saw him.  He stood approximately 10 feet tall and appeared to have a fawn in his left arm that he carried like a football.  He saw my truck  looked over his right shoulder and ran up the hill like the six million dollar man. In the morning before work  August 9  2001  I went fishing on the Salmon River.  I found footprints in a gravely riverbed  approximately 16 inches in length.  Moisture was found in the footprint heal and toe areas  and from the displacement of the footprint  it appears to be from the previous evening.  Again  digits were noticeable. I have photographic evidence of these prints. ,Go north on Hwy. 3 from Hwy. 299. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,yes
357,   This sighting occurred quite some time ago  and I havenâ€™t told a lot of people.  I was a logger for 15 years  in and around northern California  and I was a timber faller  probably 5 years out of that period. Timber falling puts you out in the really remote areas  and we were always the first guys in there to drop the timber. I started working a real thick area  and began working my way back threw the thick woods  my plan was to reach the very back portion of the sale  and then cut my way back toward the logging road. The first day in there  I had the feeling of being watched  thinking it was just our boss spying on us  so I gave no further thought to it.  The next morning I spotted large tracks in the muddy areas.  It had rained hard that night  so the tracks were not sharp  and they were not from a bear.  Further into the woods  I came up on a flat spot in the faint trail that smelt so terrible  that I almost gagged.  It smelled like wet dog  a very filthy wet dog. Just past this spot is where I spotted what appeared to be human droppings. What was weird about the dropping is they were really huge  not trying to act like an expert on droppings  but the largest piece was about 18inches long  and 3inches in diameter. This really freaked me out  because there was no body else in the area. My partner was working over the other slope  and actually went out another way. The cruisers were out of this area about two months back.  This stuff was fresh looking  about a day or two old  tops. My partner was a Kroch Indian  and I didnâ€™t know the guy that well  we just paired up for that season. At quitting time  I sort of approached him about the idea of bigfoot  and he said  â€œthey have been in these woods for ever  and my people have told me many stories about them.â€  â€œYou white guys just make fun of what ever the Indian talks about  so we keep it to ourselves.â€ And  that was about it. I guess if I took him to a bar on Friday night  and got his tongue oiled up a bit  Iâ€™d have learned a bit more  but I dropped the subject.  We finished the sale and that was it. This area was really secluded with lots of deer sign.  I had a habit of mapping and remembering really good spots for future deer hunting  and prospecting spots that I would use during the winter lay-off. This particular spot  after logging  was strictly off limits  as it was part of the Fruit Grower Company  s land  and after logging they would lock up the roads. It didnâ€™t matter how long you logged their property after a sale it was shut down  and you had to stay out!   Well  hunting season arrived  and I breached the locked gate  and snuck in there for a day of hunting.   I took along my ever-present companion  Pappy  my hunting cow dog.  Him and I were inseparable  because he didnâ€™t know fear  and would attack a grizzly if you didnâ€™t keep him under control.  He had a good nose  and located many a deer that got away from me. Well  we got into the same area that I had spotted the droppings  and Pappy went on purple alert.  His fur went straight up and he acted totally weird.  He came to a halt and refused to go any further down the trail. I never saw him act quite this way!  Just 100 yards up the hill I spotted movement.  It was crouching down behind a buck-brush bush  and it just crouched there staring at us.  It was completely unnerving!  I realized I was illegally in that area  and this might be another hunter  or a DFG cop ready to bust my butt.  Note  guys were always getting busted for hunting on the California line or the Oregon line. It was just a bad spot  and it was so close to each border  it would be up to that game warded. Well  I had a Remington rifle  in a 270 caliber  with a 3x9 scope  and not really wanting to aim a rifle at another hunter  I sort of swept the total area  like I was looking for deer.  What I saw chilled me to the bone!  It was not human  and thatâ€™s about all that I can really say!  To this day  it looked like a king sized Eddy Munster  and it didnâ€™t look ape like  but it sure as hell wasnâ€™t human.  The eyes  were what got my legâ€™s going  because I wasted no time getting back to my truck and getting out of there. ,Hilt  Ca. is located right off the 1-5 freeway in the most northern part of Ca. on the Oregon border.

358,Last year when I was 12  I saw a Creature. It was about 9 45 pm. It all started when I was taking my dog outback to go to the bathroom. When I got outside I felt like I was being watched but ignored the feeling untill the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I became very nervous when my dog stood still  looked away from the house  and growled. We lived on nine acres in a rural mountain setting near a river and at first I thought it might be a cougar or a bear in the dark. Then I shined the flashlight in the direction the dog was staring  and I saw two large hairy animals go over the fence. The larger one was about seven and a half feet tall and was a female.  She just stepped over the five foot tall barbed wire and wood post fence like an athelete.  The smaller animal was about five and a half feet tall and it used a fence post to help it leap over the fence. They both had yellow eyes. Like a cat. Their hair color ranged from a very dark to a  light brown. They both had an ape like head. Then I ran back inside with my dog and told my mom and dad that I saw two Bigfoots. At first I was really scared. Then my parents went after it not to hurt it but to see it up close. I wanted to go but they woudn  t let me.(BUMMER!) When they got back they told me what they saw and what happend. My dad said when he shone the flashlight on the momma he said she just stood there an stared at him. My mom said once she and dad passed the gate toward the acerage she smelt a wet-dog musty smell.The wierd thing is that the smaller bigfoot was nowhere in sight..The momma bigfoot must have hidden the younger bigfoot either behind her or by the river.My mom said she kept hearing noises behind her.The next day me mom and my dad saw huge tracks in the grass. , ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Fall ,6093,yes
359,First off  I am a very objective and reasonable person  this is true.  In 1979  my father and I went camping in a remote spot on the summit of Mount Shasta  well away from anyone else.  At approximately 3 AM  on a moonless night  I was awakened by a noise within our camp. At the time  I thought that it was my father up to relieve himself.  Which I thought was odd  since he rarely woke up  because he usually slept like a log. I was sleeping in the bed of our truck  since my tent was mildewed. I could hear something moving around the truck thru the windows of the camper shell. Something kicked over the ice chest  and I laughed out loud  thinking my father had tripped over it. Yet  I heard no cussing  as he was prone to do.  Something hit the truck with such force  that the truck rocked violently. I thought I it was a joke being played on me by my father. Then  I heard something that sounded like a rabbit  screaming   yet  much louder  almost raspy  yet very piercing.  Needless to say  I was afraid for my life. I grabbed my rifle and waited. Then I heard nothing but the sound of my father unzipping his sleeping bag  and then his tent. He asked if I was â€œOKâ€  and what happened.  He had awakened to the sound.  This may sound like a prank  fuelled by my father  but he would not dent his truck for a prank  that was his baby  and the pay for repairs was certainly not worth the laughs. The camp was a mess  and we noticed that the eggs were gone. Nothing else.  There were no visible tracks.  We were far from the road  so bare earth was not around.  We had no fire only a camp stove.  I don  t know what the significance of the missing eggs was all about  but we did find the carton a ways from the camp that morning.  I doubt any of this will help in your research  but the egg thing still puzzles me.  We  obviously  left that morning. ,A dirt road 20 miles north of Weed  heading south towards Mt.

360,We were in Orleans  Ca.  which is close to the Hoopa Indian Reservation.  I was visiting Joe and his Mom  because I have known them since I was about five or six years old.  My friend and I took a horse back ride in Humboldt county  up the Salmon River  with a guide that has cabins there.  He takes care of these cabins  and they are about a three-hour horse back ride  up the river.  I met James  the guide  through Joeâ€™s Mom  because he was staying with her when I got to California. I canâ€™t remember Jamesâ€™s last name. We stopped after about an hour and a half of riding  to water the horses  which was the Salmon River.  One of the horses got spooked  and was very jumpy  we thought maybe there was a mountain lion around or something like that.  All three of us saw this large ape looking thing walking along  like he was following us  so James jumps off his horse and threw a rock at the thing  but it wasnâ€™t startled.  It just kind of backed off into the woods. We started to ride again  and we were following the river upstream to his cabins  and the river was way below us when we saw a large black ape looking creature down by the river again.  My friend Joe and I were kind of freaked out by the thing  but James said it had happened before and not to worry about it.   We got to the cabins later on in the afternoon  about one thirty or so.  We grabbed our rods to go to the river  because James said  â€œthere is pretty good fly-fishing down thereâ€.  Joe and I were down at the river  when we saw this thing again.  We took off and told James that it was on the other side of the river  up the embankment  and in the trees.  So  he grabbed his rifle and went to where we were fishing  but it was gone. So  that night we were sitting on his porch telling stories about what we thought this thing was  when James said â€œthat what we had seen was a bigfoot  and he had encountered him several times beforeâ€. James continued  saying â€œthat it goes up into the mountains several times during the summerâ€.  Then we heard something by the tree line  and his horses were jumpy again. So  we just sat there and waited to see or hear anything again. All we saw was a black outline in the trees  which startled us again. The next day  James  s water supply  from the river  was clogged up somewhere up the river.  He has this thing where the water from the river drains into  and he can get running water to his cabin. So  we all took a walk to see if we could find the problem  and when we found it  the thing that the water drained into was busted up.  It was stepped on by something  and we blamed bigfoot  and thatâ€™s pretty much it for the story. James said â€œThat it wasnâ€™t uncommon to see a bigfoot this time of the year  a lot of people have seen itâ€.  Well  that is pretty much a common thing around there  I guess? When I got back to North Dakota  I was watching this program on the discovery channel where they were talking about bigfoot  and I saw this same store in Orleans. ,On the Salmon River by Orleans  Ca.

361,I was walking north on highway 96  on the riverside of the road  approximately 3/4 of a kilometer south of the Somes Bar store. I saw something out of the corner of my eye  and when I looked across the road  I saw what appeared to be a big  hairy  extremely tall man. I froze  and we stared at each other for what seemed like many minutes  but was probably only 30 seconds or so. When I realized that whatever Iâ€™d seen wasn  t going to harm me  I turned away for a few seconds (to see how close I was to my cousin  s driveway)  and when I looked back  it was gone. The brush that the creature was standing in was at least two meters tall  and the creature protruded above the brush from the upper chest up  so I would estimate it  s height at three meters  or maybe just a bit more. The creature looked a lot like the Bigfoot in the movie called  Harry and the Hendersonâ€™s.  ,From the Somes Bar Store  go south on Hwy 96.

362,About ten years ago  some friends  and I took a midnight hike to remote camp on Mount Shasta. The moon was full  and we were able to do the hike without flashlights. When we got to camp we set up our tents  and then we proceeded to the campfire.  Since this camp is at the tree line  which is about 10 000 feet  you are not able to build your own fire. You are either at the main fire  or in your sleeping bag  because it is cold. As I sat at the fire  I  and only I  looked down to the meadow that has the trail you hike up on. I knew that my two friends were coming up the trail behind us  so when I saw a large man at the base of the trail (less than 100 yards away) I thought it was my large Native American friend with long hair. I did think that it was strange that he was standing in the meadow alone  without a backpack  at two o  clock in the morning. We looked at each other for a while and then he started to walk off into the forest. I thought that was bizarre also  since it was really cold and again  if you were not by the main fire  you were in your tent. After wondering what he was doing  I turned my attention back to the fire  expecting my two friends to show up at any minute. Well  they did not show up for another hour. I asked my friend why he was down in the field earlier without a backpack  and our friend  swore to me that they just arrived. I then knew what I saw  and I have been a believer ever since. Thank you for listening to my story. ,A remote camp on Mt. Shasta.  I believe that Mt. Shasta is a sacred place  so please be very vague about giving a location.

363,It must have been late 70â€™s; my family and I were camping in a very primitive area near Happy Camp  California on a friend of my fathers land. I was around 8 or 10. We were camped on a river  with no one around for miles  and deer would frequently cross the river at our campsite. We kept our trash bagged up approx 30 yards from our camping area to deter bears from being drawn close to the camp area. We had 2 adult dogs and 5 newborn puppies as well. The female dog had pups on the trip. It was late at night approx 10 pm and my sister and I were in our tents sleeping and my parents were at the fire talking. My father put a few paper bags on the fire which caused it to rise quite dramatically and thatâ€™s when it started. From approx 50 yards near the trash area  came the loudest shrillest most powerful scream that my first thought was a fire engine (I was young). The adult dogs  including the protective mother started whimpering. They were medium sized dogs  not huge but not small either. The scream started traveling down river at a rapid pace. It died off to a deep growl. Whatever it was  it was very large  you could feel the immensity. You could hear this thing for what seemed to me was an eternity but honestly was probably a good few minutes. I went to the bottom of my sleeping bag and all I can remember is that I was terrified. My sister was awake at this point and the next thing I remember was my father unzipping the tent asking us if we had heard that  we replied and the next question was if we wanted to go or stay. Now  my father was a forest fire fighter for 12 years and an avid hunter and outdoorsman. He was one of the first people to have been helicoptered into a fire in California  and he had heard just about everything in the woods. This man was scared.  Unfortunately he did not bring his rifle with us on that trip he always had his trusty 30-30  why not this time I donâ€™t know. I remember seeing the fear in his eyes  and I was already scared  so it was unanimous. We packed up that night and drove 8 hours to our home in Ventura California. We had never thought about a Sasquatch up until that point. It wasnâ€™t until we were watching an episode of  In Search Of  with Leonard Nemoy back in the day that they had what they said was an actual Sasquatch vocalization. I remember all of us watching it in our living room and hearing that noise on the TV and all of us looked at each other  it was the same noise. To this day I wish to god we would have stayed until morning to see footprints or something. My parents were very no nonsense nonbelievers in just about all questionable things. Now we all believe in Sasquatch. Why did the dogs whimper? What was the huge animal that made that sound traveling so fast? What made my father so afraid that he packed us up and we left at midnight for an 8 hour plus drive home? I wish we would have stuck it out until daybreak. ,On a very primitive private piece of land right near a river also were at an active animal crossing for the river. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,no
364,I was traveling from San Francisco to visit my daughter  and since the coast was so foggy along highway 1  I went east from Eureka  Ca. to Willow Creek  Ca.  Since I did not want to travel south again to Redding we decided on highway 96 to Yreka  and I-5 as a shortcut. My youngest daughter was with me  and we had driven a long ways and so we gassed up in Willow Creek and decided to continue to drive. It was late and it was a boring uneventful dark drive up this  Bigfoot Highway 96â€  but finally we crossed a bridge on the Klamath River and got to a campground where we finally saw trailers and trucks and people type stuff. The road then goes up a switchback to a ridge for a mile or so  and I slowed my speed down to 25 mph. So  as I got to the ridge  maybe a couple miles from the bridge  I came around this last switchback  and to the right my headlights swept the left embankment and I thought there was a bear coming down the embankment towards the highway. I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet  but it was not a bear. I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me. If I didn  t see it on the bank I probably would  ve hit it  because it was that close. It got to the center line in three long steps and looked at me and then jumped off the road.  I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight. It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller  but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built. It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it. I was extremely close with high beams on  and stopped in the road. It had long arms like a gorilla or something  and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg. It had extremely thick legs and shoulders  and no man could make a jump like that. If I had a video camera in the dash of my car you would have seen the video of your life. I couldn  t make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly  but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs. I could make out the thighs and they were some guns. I was too scared to get out of my car to look over the embankment  that and my daughter was freaked out. Get the heck out of here. I took a picture of the hillside he came down. I can find the exact spot and in fact am on vacation this next week and I got an infrared camera and a motor drive dslr this time  and oh  I ain  t getting out of my car without my gun. Don  t get me wrong I ainâ€™t a gun freak but I could have rammed this thing with my car the first time. I don  t want to hurt anything  but I don  t want to get my head ripped off by something just on the other side of the dark roadside either.  This sighting was at 12 55 am and I was wide awake. I checked my odometer from where I saw him it was forty two miles to the next bridge on the river at a small town before I got to the freeway on 96. I am a recreational hunter in my younger years but this isn  t something you hunt; this is something you gawk at. Oh and as close as I was the eyes didn  t glow. I must have counted 60 deer along that road and I saw eyeballs everywhere in the road along side the road from that ridge to Yreka. This thing didn  t have glowing eyes  and I had the high beams on and watched it cross the road and look at me. It didn  t have animal eyes that glowed. It struck me that it was going to cross the road and go down to the river and was aware of its purpose like an intelligent being. ,The Seiad Valley area of Highway 96! ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,yes
365,My name is [TH]  and I have lived in an old Mining Camp  in Northern California for the past two years. During that first fall I would hear a strange whistling call that would come from a Sequoia tree that stands out in about 2 acres of blackberries that surrounds my yard. The berries run down to a thermal spring on the property that itself runs down to â€œIâ€ creek  which is around 50 ft. further up the hill from that creek. I thought this was a stray bird of maybe a tropical sort perhaps lost by someone. It would call to me in a guttural clicking sound followed by a series of sing song chirping whistles. I would call back  and then it to me and so on and so forth for around 20 minutes to 45 minutes before it would stop. It was always at dusk towards night and so I would call it a  night bird . There have also been numerous times that I smell a strong wet garbage smell that shows up suddenly in my yard and house. The latest incident is taking place around every few days now  at least for the last three and one half months. This smell shows up in the late spring and usually stays around off and on through the last apples falling from the fruit trees on my property. I rent. I have sensed something looking at me from the steep hill across the road from my house that comprises my back yard. Sort of like the feeling one gets when a puma is near. The other night I had an incident where the creature I am talking about banged on my trailer at around four in the morning. When I went outside on the porch to see if it was somebody  I had every single hair on my body go up instantly. I just knew that whatever it was; was right there. I beat feet into the house and locked the door. The early morning smell was so strong that I couldn  t even sleep. It smelled like a garbage dump. I have been around lions and have had the hairs on the back of my neck go up  but never anything remotely like this. I have heard very heavy thumps coming down the hill behind my house late at night many times during these same seasons. They sound like very heavy footfall. There is one particularly loud thump that I can hear that I think I have identified as this thing as it jumps from the road next to my house down into the my yard on its way to the creek. I have seen it twice now. The first time was around four in the morning when I walked out of my trailer onto my front porch. The door squeals so it makes a lot of noise and when I opened it I must have startled the thing. At first I thought I had just seen the biggest bear of my life until it registered in my head that it was running on two long legs  crouched over. I noticed that it was swinging two very long arms. It was the fastest moving animal I have ever seen. [In 2005] I reported it to a place here called J.Bâ€™s deli and was put in touch with [Carmine (Tom) Biscardi -- a.k.a.  the Great American Bigfoot Research Team ]. They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek. The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall  and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded  thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighborâ€™s porch. My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown. There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it  but it looks like a giant human footprint to me. These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also  do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here? I would be delighted at any input. Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27  2005 OBSERVED  I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found  and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story. For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it  and it would call back  and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me. A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine  [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area. There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are  huts   for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the  huts . The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old  maybe a couple of weeks  but no more. I saw the Bigfoot three times now  once at 4 AM in the morning  and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette. Excerpters from Report # 20720                                         August 09  2007 It was four thirty in the morning as I opened the sliding glass door to my trailer looking east towards my yard and â€œIâ€ Creek; I thought to myself  that  s the biggest bear that I have ever seen. As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating  I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek  and I said to myself    that  s not a bear . I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!! I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I  m not usually a scared kind of person  but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating  so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie. Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large  bed   for lack of a better word  there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them  but I was pretty freaked out by then.  On with the story... Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard  it smelled like a mixture of wet dog  garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that. One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see  it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway  the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails. There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent. I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled   Get out of here!  I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up  â€œYeah kind of like thatâ€  but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man  this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door. A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighborâ€™s yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes. I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasnâ€™t expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation. I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where  beds  have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints. ,I want this story to get out because I want scientists and serious researchers to have the chance to verify it  and help me study it. I do not want however  to have every kook in creation to come making trouble. I live at the edge of mining camp town. From my yard across the street on B. Road where my house sits there is really nothing but seventy plus miles of remote wilderness to the coast of California.  I don  t know about disclosing the whereabouts at this time because it is so accessible. Plus my neighbors are probably going to kill me anyway. How about hold on to it for now. I am telling you because I know how important the location is for the research aspects. There is a cave and an old mine at the end of a line drawn now from my house  to where the print was found  to where the cave is at. It is a perfect path around a hill through the forest to my house. There is a great vantage point for the thing to watch down on my property from where the print was found. It seems to be watching the place. Very smart...I think. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Summer ,6093,yes
366,Hello  my name is Thomas G.  I live in Medford  Oregon  I travel to the Applegate Region  Del Norte Humbold regions quite often  mostly Applegate in the Red Buttes Wilderness  I had a confirmed sighting June 3  2009  and have had strange occurances since 07 in this area.  I  m still very emotional about with what I seen  and can describe every moment. I didn  t know what was gunna become of me  because it  s weird trying to anticipate what it was going to do  it was 50 yards are closer to me  I watched as it ducked behind some brush by a boulder on the hill  looking down upon me. 6-7 foot tall before ducking down behind brush  ovalish head  Reddish/Dark brown fur  I seen the sulight shining off of it  s shoulders which were as big as a linebackers with full gear  amber/brown eyes  flat faced  long hair matted  and big ass eyes staring straight through me  I was crippled in fear until the adrenaline started to kick in  and I ran  and jumped down the hill which was about 8 feet above the road  ran into my car  told my friend who was with me by the river  to get into the car now  we need to go  and I didn  t stop until I got home  and out of the woods. I had planned to spend the day there swimming  and fishing the Applegate River  I have to say we were only there for less than an hour  60 miles away from my house  so it  d be a waste of gas to take that trip for only an hour  I left my house at 9 30a.m. and was back by 11 15  I admit I was speeding the whole way to my house.  If it were a bear  it would of crashed off into the woods before I even would of known it was there  cuz it would of known I was there  or if it were a Mountain Lion  I probably wouldn  t be typing this to you. I know what I saw  it wasn  t a bear or cougar  they don  t walk on their hind legs. I grew up in the Wilderness of Klamath Falls  Oregon  I  ve seen the animals that God has put on this planet  and this isn  t anything I  ve seen before except on all these videos of sightings  Think of Patty  that  s what I saw  I dunno if it was threatening at all  it was to me  there  s been alot of unsaid sighting that happen in the Red Buttes Wilderness which extends from the Ore/Cal boarder  to hwy 96 Siskyou county  Saied Valley  Happy Camp  Indian Creek Road  Oregon Caves National Monument  and prolly 1000  s of more.I read on a report that a hippy farmer from Talkemla says that he and his cohorts since they were little have been warned about the bigfoot living in this area  and that they are highly territorial aggressive  and traveling into this area  is putting yourself in oppotunity/danger of running into one of these creatures.  please contact me  nobody else will  I  m not frauding making this shit up or anything. ,[Edited] ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Spring ,6093,yes
367,I grew up in Happy Camp CA in which is a small town where Bigfoot is an icon! However  I have never believe in him. On Sunday April 18th  2010  we saw a massive  thing  walking under Independence bridge. It was well over 6 ft tall and was dark and hairy! It was walking like a human! We thought it could of been a bear  but the way it was walking  there  s absolutely no chance it was one! I had posted it on my Facebook  and a friend told me to talk to her husband because years ago  around the same area  he swore he saw a bigfoot! This has really sparked interest in me because as an un-believer  I can  t come up with another conclusion of what it could of been! We were too afraid to stop  but we are so shocked and confused on what it could of been!! ,It was along Hwy 96  in between Orleans and Happy Camp CA. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Spring ,6093,yes
368,Year  2010 Season  Spring Month  May Date  5/12 State  California County  Siskiyou Directions to location  edited out  per request of the submitter. Observed  This trip was  in actuality  an expedition my brothers and myself had planned into the mountains of Siskiyou county. Our rationale came from an obscure Californian document called which records one of the earliest Sasquatch encounters in the state as having occurred in this area.  In addition  the book also goes on to note that it was well known amongst the locals at that time that these creatures wintered in the caves   makes winter quarters in some of the caves of the Marble Mountains .  We also felt that since we would  in all likelihood  be the first people into the backcountry this early in the season it would increase our chances of encountering some sort of activity. An early scouting trip on 5/10 supported our suspicions. Late afternoon on Monday  May 10th  we left our hotel in Yreka and headed out into the mountains to familiarize ourselves with the trailhead we would be using early the next morning for our hike into the valley. The weather was quite raw  chilly with cold rain. At approximately 4 pm  as we were winding up the forest service road  we came to what may be described as an overlook or turnout. We decided to pull over and get our first real look at the mountains we would be hiking into the next day. We stopped the Jeep and my two brothers bounded out of the front and began taking pictures. I was just opening the rear door on the passengerâ€™s side when I suddenly heard what I can only describe as a loud and prolonged  â€œAHHHHH! â€ coming from my 11 oâ€™clock from a low hill roughly 400 yards away. It was a very strange sound and completely unlike anything I had ever heard in the woods before. (I live deep in the High Peaks of the Adirondacks  so I am no stranger to backcountry sounds.) It sounded like a man sort of yelling but it had a deep  animal-like quality to it. I asked my brothers if they had heard the sound  but they said that they hadnâ€™t. In fact  I believe that they thought I was joking. After a few more minutes of snapping pictures  glassing the slope and waiting around to see if whatever had made that sound was going to make it again (it didnâ€™t) we piled back into the Jeep and continued up the mountain. We followed this road all the way to the trailhead (one of our two options for tomorrowâ€™s hike) without incident. Coming back down the mountain  we now turned left onto another forest service road to reconnoiter the second trailhead. Conditions immediately went from raw to terrible. This forest service road is unpaved and the cold rain now changed to snow the higher we climbed. (Our elevation at this point was somewhere between 3 500-4 000 feet.) There had obviously been snow at some earlier point because the road had roughly an inch to an inch and a half of old snow scattered on it and piled up on the sides in patches. My brother suggested that we might want to get out of the Jeep and scan the side of the road in order to see if we could come upon any kind of tracks. We were not thinking â€œBigfootâ€ at this point  we were just trying to get an idea of what kind of animals we might be encountering in the next few days. Almost immediately  we found some large and clear bear tracks. These were good-sized tracks and I would guesstimate that they were from some 300-500 lb. animal. (Again  I live in the Adirondacks and we are well stocked with bears.) I mention these tracks because as we were following them up the hill we came across a very different set of tracks. At approximately 4 45 pm we encountered a second set of tracks crossing the road. These tracks were moving perpendicular to the bear tracks we had been following and were clearly NOT bear tracks. The first track was approximately 17-18 inches long and 6 inches in width. It looked exactly like a naked human footprint  but there was little visible arch. In other words  it was rather filled in where you would expect the arch indentation to be. The print appeared to be from a right foot and a clearly defined big toe was visible. It also seemed as if the bear we had been following had stepped directly into this track but it in no way obscured what we were looking at. These two types of tracks were directly before us so that I can say  as far as comparisons between the two  this new set of tracks had come from some completely different animal. Following the track  a 2nd track was discernable roughly 4 to 4 Â½ feet from the first track across the road. This track was much more degraded than the first track but appeared to be from a left foot of consistent dimensions with the first. The conditions wouldnâ€™t allow for any casting and  besides  we had left nearly all of our equipment back at the hotel. This was supposed to have been an in-and-out scouting run and  consequently  we were poorly prepared to document any findings. The spotty snow and the lay of the land discouraged our finding any more tracks and so  snapping too few pictures  we continued up the mountain to the junction near the lake. I must add  at this point  that our finding of these tracks in no way involved any skill on our parts. This was an instance of pure â€œDUMB LUCK.â€ If we had arrived any later  the quickly deteriorating weather conditions would have destroyed these tracks without our ever having found them. We were extremely lucky to have come across them when we did. It must also be noted that there were no signs of anyone else having come into that area before us. The only tire tracks in the mud and the snow on that road had come from our Jeep. Until we had gotten there  everything seemed to have been completely undisturbed. Further up  the road splits with the right fork heading toward a camp and the way ahead leading toward a lake. To our left was an animal corral and a short road leading to a dead end in a gravel excavation. These details would be important later but  for the moment  we decided to try forging up the road toward the lake. The way soon became impassable with snow and  having gotten the Jeep stuck a number of times  we turned back to begin our return to Yreka. Returning down the FS road we were approaching the overlook/turnout where I had heard the strange  â€œAHHHHH!â€ We were discussing this sound when we decided to enter the turnout again  being much more focused and alert this time  to see if it would repeat itself. At 5 35 pm  we put the windows down  turned the Jeep off and coasted into the turnout. Almost immediately the same prolonged  â€œAHHHHH â€ came from the same direction from which I had heard it the first time. My brother in the front seat said  â€œI heard that! â€ and we all got out of the Jeep. It was deathly quiet after we had gotten out  but two of us had definitely heard the sound this time as we had entered the turnout. After waiting a few minutes for a repetition of the noise and getting nothing but silence in return  my first brother asked my second brother to â€œWhoopâ€ at the hill which the sound had seemed to come from. I was returning to the Jeep when my second brother let out a bone jarring  â€œWhoop!â€ (a skill he apparently learned on two previous  official BFRO expeditions.) I did not hear it  probably due to my position in the Jeep  but my first brother said that within several seconds of my second brotherâ€™s having â€œWhooped â€ 5-6 hard wood knocks suddenly came from the same hillside where he and I had heard the strange vocalization. We are all very clear on what happened next. We were all out of the Jeep now  straining to hear if we could catch any more wood knocks when a blood-curdling scream suddenly came from our 2 oâ€™clock. It was a very high-pitched  prolonged  almost feminine sounding scream that seemed to be coming from a fairly good distance away. (I donâ€™t want to speculate on exactly how far.) The scream did not in any way sound like any type of big cat or some kind of bird. It sounded like a loud  human scream. It was startling and more than a little unnerving. My second brother gave another loud  â€œWhoop â€ but we got no further responses. After the scream  the woods remained quiet. With absolutely nothing happening  being a little rattled and with evening closing in  we got back into the Jeep and drove to Yreka for the night. May 11th  weather conditions were beautiful as we drove into the camp trailhead early in the morning to begin our hike into the valley. Temperatures were expected to be near the 70â€™s and the sky was bright and clear. We thought that we would be able to hike the roughly 7 and a half miles into the valley in about 5 hours. 60 lb packs and much more snow than we had anticipated quickly put an end to that idea. We decided to retreat to our fallback position and attempt an entry from near the lake. We knew from the night before that road directly to the trailhead soon became impassable for the Jeep a short distance beyond the camp junction  but it appeared from our map that it would be a relatively short hike in to the trailhead from where we would have to ditch our vehicle. While we had encountered snow up from the junction  we hoped that it was just a bad patch and that the snow would break and the hiking would be easier once we got through that particular area. Again  that proved not to be the case. Stuck now and wondering just how we were going to get into the valley  we realized that we were going to have to make a choice. We could either scrap our idea of getting into the valley from these approaches  take the long drive into Eureka and attempt an entry by going up a creek  or make camp somewhere in the immediate area and attempt a dash into the lake area with extremely stripped down daypacks. Hating the idea of another long car ride and of wasting another day without getting into the woods  we opted to find a spot close to the camp / lake junction. Driving the Jeep up the dead end road  past the animal corral  we set up camp in the old gravel pit. Our camp was situated in a flat  roughly 50 yard in diameter hollow  ringed by rough mounds of rock and gravel. Our GPS indicated that our base camp was sitting at 4 862 feet. Aside from having to hike a short distance downhill for water  our camp offered us a relatively protected haven on the mountaintop. I want to make our situation clear in light of subsequent events. We did not intend to be where we were. We were forced to make last minute decisions if we were going to try and stay with our original plans of getting into this specific valley. Our position wasnâ€™t ideal  but it did provide us with a moderate degree of comfort and a footing for making a dash into the desired area. We settled into our camp and the rest of the day passed uneventfully. After a dinner of some MREs  we passed a very quiet and bitterly cold night. The morning of May 12th couldnâ€™t come too soon. The night before had been almost too much for the gear (20 degree bags and a couple of three season tents) we had with us. I woke up at about 6 30 to winter cold and an icy tent. My second brother was already up while my first brother appeared to have retreated to the Jeep sometime during the night. He had gotten his feet wet before climbing into his bag and had been forced to use the heater in the Jeep to stop his feet from freezing. We decided to leave him in the Jeep and let him sleep. At around 8am  my second brother and I decided to gather some snow to make coffee. As the gravel pit was entirely snow free  we had to walk down past what we had nicknamed the â€œOK Corralâ€ to the junction  where there was still plenty of snow. Off to our left  a couple of hundred feet down a very steep decline from our camp  we could hear the fairly loud rushing water of a creek. As neither of us relished the idea of trying to work down that decline and then struggle back up just to get some water  we were going to make do with the snow at hand. We were just beginning to gather some snow when we suddenly heard the sound of rocks being banged together in the creek bed below us. It was very clear and very distinct. The rocks were being banged together in series of threes. Bang-Bang-Bang. There were always three bangs with equal intervals between strikes. To me  these bangs sounded entirely deliberate. After the first three bangs  I said to my brother  â€œDid you hear that?â€ He was replying that he had when the rocks banged again. Thankfully  I had brought a Handy Cam with us and I now started shooting. My brother decided to try another of his â€œWhoopsâ€ to see if we could get any response from whatever was banging rocks together in the creek. He let out his â€œWhoopâ€ and after 5 seconds we suddenly heard four loud bangs from down in the creek bed. Again  these were very loud bangs and they were clearly being made by whatever was down in the creek smashing stones together. This last series of four bangs were clearly picked up by the Handy Cam. After the last series of bangs  there were no more sounds from down in the creek. Excited and a little flustered  we rushed back to the camp to wake up our brother in the Jeep. After getting him up  we told him what had happened when we had gone to gather snow. He was excited  but said that he had been sleeping and that he hadnâ€™t heard a thing. A Zoom H2 that weâ€™d had running at the time may have picked up the banging in the creek but hasnâ€™t been properly reviewed as of this writing. At roughly 9am  my second brother and I were sitting around drinking coffee and getting things ready for our attempted dash into the lake area. My first brother was walking toward the steep slope on the edge of our camp that lead down into the creek when suddenly a very loud  canine bark startled all of us. The bark sounded like a large dogâ€™s  â€œWoof.â€ The sound had come from close below us  somewhere back in the direction of the OK Corral. We all looked up and I fully expected to see a big dog come running into camp being followed by a ranger. No such dog or ranger appeared. In fact  we looked everywhere to find the animal that had made that sound but nothing was moving on that mountain. I have heard deer and elk â€œbarkâ€ and this deep â€œwoofâ€ was nothing like that. It sounded exactly like the biggest dog in any suburban neighborhood. While that sound wouldnâ€™t seem out of place back in civilization  it seemed entirely out of place and strange in our isolated setting. It was so out of place that we all noted it. Unfortunately  I had already packed up the Zoom for our hike and completely missed catching the sound. Cleaning up and shouldering our packs  we struck out for the lake. We started walking up the forest service road  making for the trailhead. From the trailhead  it would be what we had read was a comparatively easy  little over a mile hike in to the lake. From this lake  we would be within striking distance of a second lake  which figured into two sightings reports from last year (2009). It seemed pretty straightforward. It wasnâ€™t. As the road rose up from the junction  the snow got worse. We would go through large patches that would come almost to our knees only to break through to long stretches of bare earth. It was slow going  but doable. If we had known that we would encountering so much snow  we would have been better prepared with snowshoes  poles and full winter gear. As it was  we were going through terrain in conditions we probably had no business to be attempting with woefully inadequate gear. No one said we were smart. About three miles in  we encountered a cinnamon bear. Off to our right  coming up quite a steep slope through a section of burn-out  a small to medium (about 200 lb) bear was lumbering towards us. The bear was about 30 yards away and  at first  didnâ€™t see us. We stopped and  not relishing the thought of a closer encounter  we caught the bearâ€™s attention and began to â€œidentifyâ€ ourselves. The bear stopped and a tense five-minute stare down began. The bear seemed to be standing itâ€™s ground and didnâ€™t particularly appear to want to back down. We yelled and tried to make ourselves look bigger  but none of this seemed to impress the bear. I make these points because before me  at relatively close range  I was able to observe a native bear in the wild and to see how this bear would move through these woods. This becomes important later. After yelling and waving for what felt like a long time  a can of Counter Assault was produced and we got ready for the bear. Suddenly my first brother  having had enough of this war of wills  shouted an expletive and began throwing rocks at the bear. This did the trick and the bear took off at a run back down the slope. I say this again to emphasize that I had before me a living example of how a bear looked running through those woods. We continued trekking into the trailhead  coming across deeper and deeper patches of snow  until we finally reached the true start of our hike at about 2 oâ€™clock. Post holing now into snow at times up to our thighs and waists  it became pretty clear that the inner valley was effectively sealed off. Even though the temperature was in the low 70â€™s and it was a bright  sunny day  the conditions were just too much. We decided to make some lunch and then begin the hike back to base camp. We made a small fire and had some MREs. It was after 2 45pm when we started our return to base camp and the going wasnâ€™t any easier on the way back. Later  my first brother confessed that he had begun to feel uneasy at the snowed-in trailhead. He had said nothing to me at the time  but he later told me that he had confessed to our second brother that he felt like we were being watched from the moment weâ€™d gotten there.  Much later  after weâ€™d returned home  he said that  at points  while we had been working our way back down the FS Road from the lake  he had had the strangest sensations. He said that he could feel a prickly feeling along his scalp and that he could literally feel the hair standing up on the back of his neck. He said that heâ€™d never felt anything quite like this before and that it happened twice on our return trip. Subsequently  he began lingering behind my second brother and I and videoing longer stretches of the return hike. Neither my second brother nor I experienced this uncomfortable feeling of being under observation. Things continued like this until a point approximately 2 miles from the camp /  lake junction on the FS Road. At approximately 4pm  I was actually bringing up the rear. We were a little tired by this point and we had grown quite loud  laughing and talking. I was raising my hand in a sweeping gesture to finally point at the ridiculously steep grade of the ridge on our right which we were in the process of traversing. As I raised my hand  pointing and making some stupid joke  something suddenly moved on the slope in front of me. From about 30 yards up the slope  something suddenly darted out from behind a tree and ran up the slope to a second group of trees. My first impression was the size of the object. It was big  at least 6 to 6.5 feet tall. My second brother is 6â€™2â€ and it was just about his size  if not a little bit bigger. It was bulky and muscular  and I immediately thought of a jacked-up football player. I could only see it from the waist up  due to foliage on the slope  but what I could clearly see was an upright muscular form running for the trees. I will elaborate more on this figure in a moment. My second impression was the speed at which the figure was moving. Whatever it was  it was moving over impossible terrain at a FRIGHTENING speed. I immediately thought that nothing that big should be able to move that fast. It was moving from left to right from one tree up a very steep angle of ascent (I guesstimate a 60 degree incline) at an angle to a second V-shaped group of two trees. It covered 10-15 yards in no time  moving over ground that we would have had to have climbed almost on our hands and knees. Once it reached that second group of trees  it was gone. I do not know what it did or where it went after it reached those trees. I also noticed that  whatever this was  it did not bob as it ran. It looked almost as if the figure were gliding up the slope on a track. I can say with utmost certainty  IT DID NOT MOVE LIKE A BEAR. This upright figure was nothing like the bear we had seen earlier. Whatever this was  it was unique and I have never  before or since  seen anything like it. My last impression was of its color. The figure appeared to be covered with a uniform coat of hair that was 2-3 inches in length. This hair was primarily of a coyote or burnt sienna color but there was also a lot of grey mixed in. Its fur looked almost brindled  meaning that there was almost as much grey as brown. If it hadnâ€™t of moved  I never would have seen it. Standing still  the animal blended perfectly into its background. All of this transpired in the seconds it took this animal to travel the 10-15 yards between the trees. Looking back on the figure I had seen  I can say that its form was basically that of an upright human  but there were definitely some â€œgorilla-likeâ€ characteristics as well. I saw the animal primarily from the side with a great deal of back and shoulders being presented  as if it were turning away from me. It ran with its right arm folded across its face and seemed to be looking over the top of its arm as it moved. I could see no features because of this arm covering its face  but a conical head and the edge of what appeared to be a crest were visible. The animal displayed a pronounced musculature  and I was particularly struck by the sheer size of the bicep  its back and the massive traps. Like a gorilla  I could see no neck. As already stated  the foliage obscured the rest of the animal. I immediately shouted something like  â€œOver there! â€ but by that time it was too late and whatever it was was gone.  I cannot stress enough to any one who has never seen an animal like this how profoundly disturbing the speed at which this animal is capable of moving is. I had been holding a Handy Cam on standby and ready to go and I was never able to get off a shot. I believe this is exactly why more of these animals havenâ€™t been filmed  they just move too fast.  All I could do was stand there pointing with my mouth hanging open. My brothers asked me what was going on and I tried to tell them. I know that they did not believe me at first. I kept insisting that Iâ€™d just seen a â€œBigfootâ€ run up the side of the mountain and  gradually  they started to realize that I wasnâ€™t joking. We stood there for a few minutes  gawking and staring up the side of the mountain into the trees  but there were absolutely no sounds or movement coming from the direction in which the creature had gone. My second brother went so far as to try using some â€œsamurai  chatterâ€ in hopes of eliciting some response from the animal if it were hiding close by  but there was no response. After about 10 minutes of nothing  we decided to continue on our way back to camp. I know that this was a decision that will frustrate many people who might read this report and it deserves a word of explanation. On my part  the thought of climbing up that slope to search for prints  hair  or possibly even another look at the animal did not even enter my mind. I must stress that the thought was never there to be dismissed. It was inconceivable. Now  I equate it to sitting in a small boat fishing when  suddenly  something large and unknown cruises under your boat. You do not think of jumping into the water to see what that large thing was. This is not fear. From my brief experience  all I can say is that you do not naturally want to move closer to one of these animals. The reason is as simple as that. Ironically  although my brothers hadnâ€™t seen the animal  they didnâ€™t discuss going up that slope either. It just didnâ€™t feel â€œright.â€ From that point on  although we were all keyed-up and anxiously waiting for something else to happen  we returned to base camp without further incident. It was now sometime after 5pm and we had some decisions to make. Basically  we debated whether or not we should stay or  in light of that dayâ€™s activity  pull out. We opted to break camp and spend the night in Willow Creek. This decision also deserves a word of explanation. Our first consideration was the extremely difficult weather conditions that we had been enduring from the start of the expedition. We had been in snow and facing below freezing conditions that we had not been prepared for. The thought of another icy night in the tents or  worse  all of us crammed into the Jeep trying to stay warm were hard trials to think about. While the daytime temperatures were mild and pleasant  the nighttime almost 5 000 feet up in a gravel pit on the top of a mountain was brutal. In this regard  we were not being smart. Our second consideration was the thought of the animal we had just encountered  both directly and indirectly  paying us a visit in the darkness. While my brothers were game for such an encounter  I most definitely was not. This was not coming from fear on my part; I will argue that it was just good common sense. It was definitely going to take me some time to adjust to what I had just seen. In the end  my brothers gave in to my desire to pullout. I am grateful to them. I still donâ€™t regret our decision. Feeling pretty damn happy with everything weâ€™d accomplished already  we ended this leg of our expedition. Having had some time now to mentally digest what had happened during our short stay in these mountains  my brothers and I have put together some ideas concerning the activity we observed  1. We definitely feel that whatever was making those â€œAHHHHH!â€ calls on our first day was acting as some sort of sentry or lookout. Whatever was watching the road only called out when we came into view and its position allowed it an excellent opportunity to monitor all possible human traffic into and out of those valley access points. (We did not hear it during our final departure from the mountains but it was getting quite late by then.) 2. Based on the fact that something screamed from a second position in seeming response to the first callerâ€™s woodknocks  there was definitely more than one of the creatures in the area. 3. Based on my brotherâ€™s intuitions  my sighting  and a subsequent development  we feel that we â€œpicked upâ€ something at the snowed-in trailhead and that this something was trailing us from higher up on the side of the mountain during our return hike to base camp. 4. I believe that my sweeping/pointing gesture caused the animal to believe that it had been observed and that this caused it to break and run for new cover. This is the only reason we even knew the animal was there. I also would like to add a final observation concerning the creature I observed. One of the names the Native Americans of Northern California have for this creature is Tintah-kâ€™iwungxoyaâ€™n  which translates into something like â€œBoss of the Mountain.â€ I can think of no better name for the animal I saw. This animal seems perfectly suited for its environment. It can blend into and move through its terrain at will. Its size suggests a lot of power and its speed is startling. It outclasses us in the backcountry in every possible way. This animal could have  if it had wanted to  taken us at any time and there would have been very little we could have done about it. It definitely deserves our respect and protection. I would also like to add two postscripts to this report  1. On May 13th   we stopped by the China-Flat Museum to see the Bigfoot wing. While we were there  we were talking to Peggy McWilliams from the museum about what weâ€™d experienced during our short stay in those mountains. After some interesting comments on her own part about those caves near the rim  she called our attention to a gentlemen who was just entering the museum. This gentleman turned out to be Al Hodgson. After some brief small talk  we told Mr. Hodgson about our recent experiences. He was quite interested and  at several points during our story  actually made the comment  â€œThat sounds about right.â€ We showed him the pictures of the tracks and these also seemed to intrigue him. When all was said and done  he very kindly asked us for our names and our contact numbers. As he was leaving  he turned to me with a smile and said  â€œIn forty years  Iâ€™ve never seen one.â€ He was a  gentleman from beginning to end  fascinating to talk to and a genuine pleasure to have met. 2. On May 25th  my second brother was reviewing the footage from his video camera. We had been shooting with two cameras and we had well over 12 hours of footage to go over. While reviewing footage we had shot on May 12th  he came to a portion that he had filmed after our return to base camp from our hike back from the lake trailhead. This footage was shot just as we reentered camp and were facing back toward the mountain and the junction. While it will never convince the skeptical  the video shows something large moving through the trees until it comes to a small clump. The object ducks down and then what appears to be a head pokes out on one side  facing in the direction of our camp. The shot ends after about 40 seconds. None of us had any idea at the time that the figure was there. Itâ€™s an intriguing end to a very intriguing experience. I am extremely happy to have some evidence to support my sighting. In retrospect  I am even more glad now that we didnâ€™t attempt climbing up that slope after the running figure. This video seems to suggest that whatever it was  it never moved after it hid behind those trees. If we had climbed that slope  I now believe that the animal I had seen would have been waiting there. In all likelihood it would have run again  but I really would hate to think about having an up-close  face-to-face encounter with whatever was on that mountain. In addition  in light of the fact that this video was shot almost 2 miles further down the FS Road from where I had initially seen the creature  I now believe that this animal waited for us to move and then continued tracking us all the way back to our camp. While I donâ€™t in any way feel that we were in serious danger from this creature  I feel even better now about having spent that last night in Willow Creek. ,Please edit out location specifics. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Spring ,6093,yes
369,On December 3   2011 we were heading east on hwy 96. We live in Happy Camp Calif. We left around 6pm we were going to Redding Ca. to pick up my son from the Grey Hound Bus station We passed a few cars coming the oppiset direction so every so often I had to dim my head lights. We were about one and a half hours in to the drive. I had to dim my head light  s again and as we just passed 8 mile bridge I figured that I should hit the brights lights as we went around a vary slight curve (thats when) I hit the brights at that same moment a large rock (bolder ) stood up (straight up). It looked at us (me) It was a light grey color and had long shaggy hair. It had big eyes that looked yellow ( from the head lights would reflect off an animal?) I drive a 2001 Jeep Cherokee it was a lot bigger (taller) than my Jeep 4x4. It stood vary still except for its head it fallowed the car. When it stood up my mind went blank and I took my foot off the excelorator  we had a vary good long look at him maybe about 15-20 seconds it felt like forever.  The Jeeps head lights were on him the whole time! He seemed vary startled like we spooked him. To me he looked like he was trying to blend in with the surrounding mountain side I wrote a letter and a map I tried to paste it on this form. I had 4 of my children with me and 3 of them had seen him the 4th was asleep this time of year their are lots of rocks all over the hwy we were almost to the I-5 on ramp. When I came back to my senses I screamed so did everyone else and hit the gas and got out of their quickly we drove to the rest area and I had to get out of the car to breathe and stop shaking we all had to calm down. Now any time we have to go to town my son asks me if we are going to Yreka way if so he gets vary afraid. I know what we had seen that night .His body shape was that of a runner vary tall and slim and muscular not fat lean strong. I will take a lie detector test....I do not know what else to say I  m probally forgetting something. ,Right after the turn off to Yreka (8 mile bridge) and before the houses on that strech of Hwy on the mountain side of the hwy we were on the river side. ,Siskiyou,31,California ,CA,Winter ,6093,yes
370,Well I have collected enough information from various bigfoot sites about screams to conclude that I heard a sasquatch on a bicycle touring trip from Portland  OR to Santa Barbara  CA in the summer of 1981. My girlfriend & I arrived at Fort Ross Historical Park north of Jenner  CA in Sonoma County on an evening in early July. We decided to camp there at Fort Ross as it was marked as a campsite on our map  but it had no campsites. There was no one at the main house nor around the fort (Old Russian Fur Trading Fort) or on any part of the grounds. We rode to a campground further south but it was too expensive & we decided to ride back to Fort Ross. We camped to the left of the upper parking lot under some monterey pines next to a picnic bench. We ate dinner & went to bed at around 9 p.m. At approximately 1 a.m.  we heard a scream 20 feet to the left of the tent (our heads were facing the ocean).  It was a blood curdling scream of various sounds in succession that lasted at least 9 seconds. It frightned me to my bone marrow. I froze in fear knowing that whatever made the sound was huge. It was so close I could hear the timbre in its throat. Since I  m a musician I realize how much force it takes to make a sound that loud. I  ve also been camping all my life  & have heard various animals but this was different. Anyway  my girlfriend said in a whisper  What the [edit] was that!  I started to reach for a flashlight and her hand grabbed my wrist with a vice-like pressure so I didn  t move. We remained frozen listening to every little noise for an hour. Incedently there were sheep running free everywhere going baah baah & they didn  t stop making noise when the scream occured. Finally my girlfriend fell asleep & I remained on guard with my hands hovering around the tent pole to use as a weapon  thinking that at any moment it would stick its fanged head into our tent. At around 2 30am (I guess) I heard another scream down by the fort in the lower parking area. I figured it wasn  t coming back so I fell asleep. It didn  t occur to me the next morning that it was a sasquatch so I didn  t look for footprints. Nor did I hear it walking the night before. , ,Sonoma,5,California ,CA,Summer ,6097,no
371,It was in the summer of 1986 when myself  my friend and his brother set off to climb Bennett Peak in Santa Rosa. Back then there was only a golf course separating the rural area from Annadel State Park. The way we climbed took us over a series of smaller hills before we got to the base of the peak. On our descent off the last hill we took a break knowing the large climb ahead of us. Just then we heard the loud snapping and cracking of tree limbs directly across the valley that separated ourselves from Bennett Peak. It was then I spied a huge brown/black hairy back trucking up the peak at a very fast pace. As this creature moved up the hill it basically was clearing all of the foliage  mainly oak tree branches  out of its way. When we reached the spot where we saw this thing  we noticed that the tree branches that were damaged were four to five feet off the ground. Bear? Maybe but we don  t get much bear in Santa Rosa. ,Bennett Peak behind Bennett Valley Golf Course ,Sonoma,5,California ,CA,Summer ,6097,yes
372,I was traveling to the coast toward Petaluma just past Sonoma area either Hwy 116 or 12  I don  t remember  around nine years ago and around 11 pm when out jumped somthing on the road.  There was a car coming toward us so this thing huge in stature turned both directions allowing us to see it was on two legs  then it leaned forward with a bolt of speed.  It jumped a fence up hill in a full run with out the use of its arms and was gone quick so quick  I knew it was not a person , ,Sonoma,5,California ,CA,Fall ,6097,yes
373,I am a law enforcement officer. I have no reason to lie about what I saw and frankly I don  t care if anyone believes me. I have heard of these kind of things here and there but never paid close attention to it or laughed it off.  It  s not that I didn  t believe  I  d just believe it when I saw it. It was a very warm  almost hot evening just after or before labor day in 2007. It was dark  around 8 30 or 9 00 PM but the sky was still a little lit up in the West that time of year.  I was on patrol  driving W/B on Hwy 128 out of Cloverdale going to an alarm call out at some ranch property.  Those calls are very common. As a law enforcement officer  you notice things out of place.  A car here that wasn  t parked there yesterday  a person walking along the road in a desolate area  lights on in a closed business....things like that. Things just catch your eye that other people don  t notice. Like I said  I was driving W/B and saw someone coming up out of the ravine onto the roadside. I can  t describe it...I just saw the movement in the brush and knew it was someone.  People run from us all the time and I thought I may have surprised someone who might be growing marijuana in the woods or something like that. It happens a lot here.  I saw the outline of a body  the reflection of my headlights in it  s eyes and it ducked back into the scrub brush before I passed it. Thinking it was someone trying to avoid or hide from me  I hit the brakes and backed up quickly.  That  s when I saw it in my headlight beams.  It was about 6-7 ft tall  thick matted brown fur and walking upright. I did not see the face  it was walking away from me but slowly.  Like everyone else says  I couldn  t believe what I was seeing.  It was definitely something I was not gonna put out on the radio. There were a lot of branches and overgrowth in the way  but there was no mistake on what I saw. I specifically remember two things.  One was that it had small leaves and grass matted into its fur all over its back. I saw that as it walked away from me.  I remember that vividly. Second  I remember that it used slow  deliberate movements.  It walked away and used its arm to swipe small limbs and twigs out of its way.  I saw it from the backside for a good 4-5 seconds before it disappeared into the overgrowth again.  I then got out of my car and stood there for about 2-3 minutes with the engine off.  I could hear the same slow movements and crunching of leaves and sticks for a while. I could hear it down there making its way into the creek area.  Everytime I stopped hearing it and would start to walk back to my car  I  d hear a  Crunch  in the distance and I  d listen a bit longer. There is a creek down in that ravine which is probably where it went back to. Needless to say  I told no one.  This wasn  t something to bring up in briefing or to put in the patrol blotter. That would make for an extremely long and uncomfortable career for anyone. A friend of mine from back East told me about this website.  I didn  t know who else to contact. I almost contacted one of our Fish & Game Officers up here but he knew too many of my friends  so I just kept it quiet. I read a lot of other postings on here and it  s nice to know I  m not alone. I  ve never seen a ghost  UFO or anything like that  but this really makes me wonder now what else is out there that we laugh off from time to time.  ,East/West Highway.

374,While riding our bike just after sundown my dogs started going crazy  I looked at my dogs and saw that the hair on their backs was straight up.  I looked in the direction they were barking and standing in a suger beet field thirty to forty feet away was a humanoid figure covered in long shaggy grey hair.  This thing was massive and I would imagine it was at least eight feet tall.  It didn  t move - it just stood there looking at us.  Needless to say in 1962 I didn  t know what bigfoot was so I turned my bike around and got the hell out there. My dogs a collie and an Australian shepherd beat me home. ,It was on Apricot ave. about half mile from the San Joaquin river. ,Stanislaus,2,California ,CA,Summer ,6099,yes
375,Well  this was many-many years ago and I  ve actually been very reluctant to even mention this  but after reading your web site  and seeing various reports on the t.v. / and documentaries  has made me think even more of what I had seen that night. What happened was one early Morning in 72 or 73  I was with my uncle and we were going either deer or bear hunting. I would say it was about 4-5 in the morning  it was very crisp morning I would but it maybe 35-45 degrees. We left my uncles ranch [my uncle and I]  as we were going down the road about 3 miles from his house  I noticed out of the headlights what appeared to be maybe a cow coming out of an olive orchard.  As we got closer  I noticed that the creature was on all fours  the upper part [thoracic] seemed to arch and it was higher  than the rear part [postural]  the fur was dark but seemed to shine with the headlights  the head itself did seem to be round in a way with the exception that the occipital area seemed to be more pointy. The creature crossed the 2 way road  I would say that the length of the body itself was almost 1/2 the length of this 2-way country road. I did notice that it crossed the road in  I would say 3 strides.  When it got to the other side it went down the irrigation ditch 2ft down  at this time it was coming out of the headlights  but the figure seemed to have stood  then take one step over the fence.  So if we figure that it stood on a irrigation ditch 2ft below the road and then took a step over a 4ft fence  what ever it was huge. There were things that did catch my attention.  1.The fur how it shined  it seemed to sway with the movements of the body. 2. At the level of the shoulders  I would say it was as the same height  as my uncles F-250 4wd  which I will say that the hood stands easily 5ft. 3. As we approached the creature did turn his head to look at us  the face was dark  humanoidish like  it  s eyes where planted firmly in front and not to the side  also the creature seem to like growl at us because it did show us his teeth. 4. Now when the creature did turn his head  it seem to do so with some difficulty  as it completed its rotation of the head it seem to make its right shoulder move towards the back and I would attribute this because it had a very short neck. 5. The eyes in the headlights were RED  but yet the teeth did not seem to shine yet you knew they were teeth  also the mouth area seemed to be almost flat like  in other words more human like  and not a snout like a bear or cat would have. After we passed I do remember my uncle mentioning that there must be a skunk around cause it stank.  Personally  I cannot smell so I cannot account to that. After it crossed the fence I could not see it any more. p.s. You could see the movement of the muscles of the upper body. ,Get off I-5 @ South Ave  go south 1 mi to Tehama Ave  turn right  go over the over pass take first left  Barham Ave  go 1/4 mi and you  re there. ,Tehama,5,California ,CA,Winter ,6103,yes
376,Backpacking with my younger brother in Middle Eel Yolla Bolly wilderness  california. He was 16  I was 21. This is a very remote area. We had a great deal of difficilty getting there via rough logging roads. First night  close to the trail head we heard lots of animal sounds which reinforced the remoteness of the area. The next morning we hiked out of our camp and started heading down to the river. This was not by choice  it was the only trail out of there. I  ll admit to being distressed that day. We got lost twice (once with attendant panic)  and ran out of water about 4 to 5 miles in. We were paralleling the Eel River and decending in altitude. My hope was that would make it to the river but the trail was wiped by a slide. Going down the slope to the river was out of the question as it was far to steep. We hiked a little further to get a better look at the slide. Water was getting to be a real concern now. A few hundred yards from the slide was a trickle of water crossing the trail.  This was the only water we had seen for miles. There was just enough room to get our canteens partly filled. There was mud where the water crossed the trail and there was a giant foot print in the middle of it. It was maybe 18 to 19 inches long and maybe 6 to 7 inches wide. Water was seeping back into the depession  which gave me a sick feeling like the thing had just been there. There was no misinterpretation. We both quickly dismissed it as a bear (or human) track. The area up slope of the seep was disturbed but more like a very rough game trail  very steep. It was late in the afternoon at that point. I made the decision that we would have to spend the night in that location. This elicited howls of protest from my 16 year old brother. We layed out our bags a few yards away and spend a wide awake night in that location. No unusal sounds were heard during the night.  We high tailed it out of there as soon as there was light. ,Access from East. Started high and paralled the river for 5 - 7 miles. ,Tehama,5,California ,CA,Summer ,6103,no
377,I was driving home (see details  below) with my son and daughter late at night.  Suddenly an ape crossed the road with incredible speed.  We all three saw it.  We had been talking excitedly about who knows what  all very alert  all eyes on the road  when this occurred.  Our conversation came to a complete halt.  All three of us had to process what we had just seen  we just couldn  t believe our eyes.  This was an ape-like animal  about the size of a large chimpanzee  traveling across the road with what can only be described as lightening speed.  It disappeared on the other side of the road as if it had disappeared into another dimension--almost swallowed up by the night so to speak.  It was on its knuckles  more or less  the way apes run.  This was apparent to all three of us  we are all fairly intelligent people with a wide variety of experience with animals.  We have lived in the woods for 20+ years in Manton in Tehama County and have all seen mountain lions  bears  racoons  otters  fisher  ringtails  raccoons  etc. and this was nothing like any of those animals.  We all three had the same experience  we all three agreed that what we had just seen had to be some kind of primate.  And we all three had never seen anything move like that before in our lives.  After some discussion we agreed that it might be a young Sasquatch.  In the days ahead I got some literature about Bigfoot at the library  and we have determined that it may very well have been a Bigfoot sighting. ,We were driving on county road A6  off of Hwy 36 between Dales and Manton  in Tehama County. ,Tehama,5,California ,CA,Summer ,6103,yes
378,We were on a camping trip to Eagle Lake  California I woke up in the early morning around 3 a.m. to a yell. I thought I was dreaming at first and then it repeated. I didn  t want to wake my wife so I whispered her name and to my surprise she answered me by saying   That  s Bigfoot  isn  t it ? I kinda laughed and said  I think it is  we  ve both heard recordings of it on TV  but this was our first  live  experience. Not all recordings we  ve heard are the same as what we heard. This was a deep human/ape yell  and it lasted 4-6 seconds. Then a pause like it  s filling its lungs and it would let it rip again. As in other reports  I  ve been camping all my life and heard all kinds of animal sounds. When you hear this one  you know it  s something different. Actually  it  s beautiful in its own way. I listened to the same yell on the home page of this website just today. It was hard to determine how far off the yells were  but if I had to guess I would say maybe a mile? About 10-15 minutes later we had an even better gift from the creature. Just up the hill from our campground we heard a loud bang. It was so loud  the only way I can describe it was that it sounded like a car drove into a tree. It was a very loud BOOM! Then one of the campers  who were camped at the base of the hill where the BOOM came from  said three words. I will not say what he said. They did make a fire and I  m sure they were scared. The next morning they were packed up and gone by the time I got up around 7. The campground host had their lantern on when I got up to listen to the yells at 3 a.m. I think they heard the yells too. I asked them the next morning and they said it might have been sirens. I could tell that she was trying to keep it quiet. She doesn  t want folks to be scared to camp  or maybe she just didn  t want to believe it herself. The next morning I took a drive across the Hwy 36 from the campground with my boy. We went on a dirt road just for fun to look at the terrain while my wife fixed breakfast with my daughter. The dirt road we were on was numbered 31N17  and we only went up a few miles and headed back to camp.  But it was up in those mountains off that dirt road somewhere  where the yells came from. The â€œBANGâ€ was in our campground so it  Bigfoot  had to have crossed Hwy 36 to get on our side. Another note  it honestly sounded like a log connecting with a huge Ponderosa pine  and it was very  very loud. ,Going east on Hwy 36 from Red Bluff  and just east of the town of Mineral  California  and before you get to Hwy 89 there is a campground on the south side of the highway.

379,Some friends and I had come home late from a dance and were setting in the house tuning a guitar when all of a sudden we heard this loud wail or cry coming from outside.  It was cold but no snow yet.  We went outside on the porch and could still hear this piercing wail.  It stopped and started again as we tried to tell where it was coming from.  Across from the old house was some rock bluffs about 80 yards up the hill.  The sound seemed to come from atop these bluffs.  The cry started at a lower key and rose up in pitch and intensity and lasted at least a couple of minutes.  We got scared and went back in for the night and locked all the doors. The next morning Arden and I went up on the bluffs and found a cleared area about thirty feet across.  The small trees had been pulled out of the ground and thrown to the side.  Everything else had been trampled down flat.  The ground was too hard for tracks but there was a hard smell in the area.  My neck still feels funny when I think about that call. ,From Garberville take the Blocksburg Road to Fort Sewart and from there to the little town of Zenia  right next to the Six Rivers national forrest. ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Winter ,6105,no
380,A tremendous storm came in off the Pacific.  My friend and I took shelter in a plastic  tube tent .  About Midnight we heard a large animal walking around our camp.  The animal had two legs  not 4.  The animal had soft feet  not hooves.  The animal was walking through brush and the forest floor.  The weight of the animal was breaking branches  that  from the sound  were at least one inch in diameter.  The animal walked around our campsite screaming for most of 4 hours.  The screams were blood curdling  and almost human  but louder and unlike any animal I am familiar with. I have hiked the Trinity Alps all my life.  I know the trails and the environment intimately.  Better than Luther Linkhart who wrote the book on the Trinity Alps.  This was not a bear  I have heard and seen dozens of them and chased lots of them out of camp.  This was not a deer  I have seen hundreds of them and had them step over me at night when I camped on a trail.  This animal had two legs  the difference between a 4 legged and 2 legged gate is easily distinguished.  This animal was very heavy and was breaking large branches as it walked  but it had no hooves.  This was not a mountain lion.  I have had them follow me and have heard them scream.  Mountain lions do not snap branches. We were in the only stand of trees for a mile in any direction.  The animal took shelter in that stand of trees and spent the night with us  walking around our camp and screaming all night.  I am certain it was frightened as the wind was breaking large branches and there was a lot of lightning and thunder.  At some moments it was no more than 20 feet away  but it was too dark to see that far  and no way were we going to turn a flashlight on it.  It was truly frightening.  I was 16 at the time  but I was used to facing down mountain lions and chasing bears out of camp with a spoon and a plate.  This animal was terrifying. I found this page as a link from an SF Chronicle article.  When I loaded up the scream sound from Ohio  that was it.  Except  when that scream is from a frightened animal 30 feet from you no recording could ever do it justice. In the morning we looked for prints or sign  but a wet forest floor over granite is the wrong surface  and we found no sign.  We headed back the 14 miles to the car at top speed.

381,Heard what I thought was music and low voices coming from low hills on each side of creek. One low voice or sound on one side  then another on the opposide side of creek. I was cooking diiner with my small optimus stove and had camp set. Sound was so strange that picked up camp and hiked down the the moonlit trail. (All the time I felt I was hearing limps and sticks break above me on ridge line. I was in the middle of my thru hike of the Pacific Crest Trail and had been outhiking since April 2nd. I have never heard these sounds in all my hiking or hunting days past or present. In the morning  I stopped at a side creek to fill my water bottles. I walked above the trail for a deeper pool to dip bottles in and found where something had crossed and slid vegation going down and then up. Next to creek was a large footprint in small sand bar. The other prints were not as clea  but I wish I would have taken there pics as well. I haven  t told many folks about the sounds or print till the last few years. Good luck with your research. I feel that at least in 1977  Bigfoot was still alive and well. (I believe there were two comunicating across the creek.

382,I and my former wife encountered three unusual events in a two year period  twice on horseback. The first was a series of foot prints ( one very clear that we photographed)  on a trail near the Bar-717 ranch east of Hyampom.It was about 17 inch. long and 7 inch. wide. Next was a sound heard at night when we worked for the Manzanita ranch west of Hyampom at about 11 30 at night. It woke us up and was an incredibly loud screaming that is hard to discribe. Never heard such a vocalization before or since. (Third is detailed in another report.) , ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Summer ,6105,no
383,I and my former wife encountered three unusual events in a two year period  twice on horseback. [First two are detailed in a different report.] Thirdly  My former wife and a friend were riding a back trail to another friends house from the Hayfork fairgrounds after dark when my wife  s horse alerted her that something was up ahead. She said  hey  there  s somebody up ahead    it moved diagonally towards us into the brush  was fast  silent and never made a verbal sound. It was very large a black silhouette that looked human (I even said howdy to it) it caught us by suprize so i wasn  t spooked untill long after the event and I really thought about it. I thought it was a huge untalkative hippie right at the moment. Sitting on my horse I was at head level with it. My horse about 30 yrds. past it was the one that got goofy and spun around a bit. We proceeded through the woods to our friends house and never said anything untill the next morning at breakfast. , ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Fall ,6105,yes
384,My dad  my cousin  his wife  and myself  along with six others went on a 10-day deer hunt in the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area.  We had contracted with a local outfitter to meet us at the trailhead and to transport us and all our equipment to a campsite selected by the outfitter.  He had been contracted to return to pick us all up later and return us to our trucks at the trailhead. The outfitter transported all of us and all of our gear to a location approximately 12 miles south of the trailhead.  This was accomplished by using horses and mules.  The ride was approximately 4 hours in duration each direction  although the horses did seem to walk faster as they got closer to their corral at the trailhead.  We had also contracted to rent two horses and one mule to assist in deer hunting and retrieval efforts. The first night at camp was uneventful.  The second day  another hunter (J.K.) and I decided to spend the night on the ridge across the valley to the east of our camp in order to be in position for a good spot to deer hunt the following morning  which was the first day of deer season (opening day is always on a Saturday). J.K. and I  along with my dad and J.K.â€™s dad  packed our gear for a small  remote camp across the valley to a spot near the tree line  the ridge  and a natural â€œdraw/saddleâ€ which crossed over into a valley to the east.  We set-up our small camp and constructed two small deer hunting blinds for use the next day.  Everyone else left by mid-afternoon  leaving just myself  J.K.  and Nancy (the mule) on that ridge.  Two events happened that night. 1. Loud Scream â€“ without any prior warning  noises or animal sounds  J.K. and I heard an extremely loud â€œscream.â€  Only a single vocalization can be recalled. This scream began high-pitched in nature  resembling a woman screaming.  The beginning of the scream was reminiscent of a woman being murdered from an old Alfred Hitchcock film.  The unexpected scream was explosive and violent in nature.  This first portion lasted approximately 3-4 seconds. The scream then changed tone to one with a deeper quality to it.  This portion sounded similar to 3 mountain lion cries in rapid succession.  This second portion lasted 2-3 seconds. Finally  the scream ended with an even deeper tonal quality.  The end of this scream resembled the growl of a bear.  This final sound heard was a very deep growl/rumble  which just trailed off.  This portion lasted 2-3 seconds. The scream originated from a location approximately 75-100 yards northwest and approximately 50 feet lower in elevation of our position.  It sounded like the sound emanated from the tree line at the far edge of a large  nearby meadow.  Upon very distant investigation with crappy flashlights  we saw nothing. 2.  Injured Mule â€“ Our rented mule  â€œNancyâ€  was tied to a small pine tree in a small clearing approximately 50 feet from our camp/tent.  Our very small tent was separated from this clearing by a small grove of short to medium sized pine trees  and it was between our tent and the large meadow mentioned earlier.  Our camp was on the edge of a North/South ridge; with the mule being due north of us  and a very steep drop-off only about 100 feet was due east.  The large â€œmeadowâ€ was actually not a meadow at all; it was a sloping  natural pass with a well-worn hiking trail along the south side. After the excitement of the scream had worn off  approx. 30-45 minutes later and as we were getting into our tent for the night  the mule suddenly began sounding as if something were scaring the crap out of her.  She was â€œsounding outâ€ very loudly and very excitedly.  We could also hear her hoofs pounding the ground. J.K. and I both scrambled over to her  with guns and flashlights in hand  to find her in a state of great excitement.  This muleâ€™s ears were laid back; her eyes were wide open and darting about.  Nancyâ€™s breathing was also very rapid  and her nostrils were flaring. She was still tied to the tree where we had left her.  Actually  she was as close to the small tree as she could get.  But as we approached her  we noticed she was holding her left front hoof off the ground.  She did not appear as though she wished to put any weight on that leg  but we could find absolutely no sign of trauma to the leg.  And upon further examination  we found no other obvious signs of physical injury to Nancy at all.  She was obviously psychologically traumatized  as she whimpered and shook for quite some time afterwards.  We untied her and moved her to an area next to our tent. A brief search of the immediate area with crappy flashlights and high-powered weapons yielded nothing productive  other than some possible shadows in the distance.  The ground was very firm and we found no tracks that night or the next day. The following day  and upon return of my dad and J.K.â€™s dad to our location  we described the events of the previous evening and we all examined the swollen left front knee of Nancy.  Even in the daylight and upon very close examination by everyone  no obvious signs of trauma were noted to Nancyâ€™s leg.  But it was indeed swollen to approximately twice its normal size and she had difficulty placing her weight on it.  Her knee had begun to subside in swelling somewhat by the time we were due to return to our trucks  and she did carry her appointed rider home as scheduled. No real explanation was ever agreed upon as to what made the screaming sounds or as to the cause of Nancyâ€™s injury.  The remainder of the week passed without any similar incidents. ,Take Interstate-5 to Redding  west to Weaverville  north on Highway 3 to Coffee Creek Road  then west to Big Flat Trailhead.

385,Back in the 80  s  my husband and I were driving late at night in Trinity County  near Lewiston.  Off to the right hand side of the road appeared a large animal.

386,I was camping at a spot called Big Slide just outside of Hyampom  California in Trinity County. There were at least five of us all sleeping on the beach of the South Fork of the Trinity river. I woke up in the night  having heard something loud enough to make me sit up.  It was a bright moon that night and I could see across the river to the other bank quite clearly.  I saw a large creature on two legs shaking a tree.  It was a huge pine tree  I remember looking to the top of the tree and registering that it was a BIG tree to be shaking with such force. I tried to wake the friend to my right  no one else awoke.  I had no doubt in my mind that I was seeing Bigfoot.  Everyone there knew Trinity Co. was a stomping ground for them. The river was running so I never heard any noise from it  s mouth.  It eventually stopped it  s tree shaking and ran down the beach in an arc and off into the woods.  I told myself that I would check it  s footprints out in the morning.  I went to sleep. The next day I remembered it all like a dream coming back.  I took my biggest friend over to the other side of the river and we found the tracks in the sand.  We had him run into the sand from the forest and back out again  just as I had seen the Bigfoot do.  He was a 6   man weighing at least 180 and his tracks shrank to about half the size of the prints that we had found in the sand. We all agreed that it was odd.  We all agreed that the prints were REAL and not from a bear or a man. , Big Slide  swimming hole on the South Fork of the Trinity river. ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Summer ,6105,yes
387,As my friends and I sat around our campfire  about 3 miles from the trail head at a flat  well trampled site  we heard a group of low based voices  mummbling  down the hill and braking large sticks. When the voices drew closer to our camp we heard them change to a more high pitched tone  possibly suprise and uncertainty. Since it was spring the river was swollen and my companions dismissed the noise as something like  stream garggle echo.  But when it suddenly stopped there was a great abscence of sound and the river couldn  t reproduce the noise. I then witnessed large tall shadows move through the trees and down the bank to a flat granite river bank. It was then that what I can only describe as a  protest dance  began. The sasquatch began stomping with enough force to almost bounce me up and down on a log seat and the chants grew loud  spirited and quite hysterical. The seat I was on was a thick log supported on either side  about seven feet apart by other logs  that literally bounced when the protest dance  began. The message of their chant was unmistakable in any language    GET THE --== OUT!  So much that I declared   whatever that is doesn  t want us here  let  s just pack up and go!!!  My friends  although visibly quite shaken  were still reluctant to concede our site. Then  abruptly the chants  actually shouts and screams stopped. With a few deep hooted orders from what I believed to be the male  the pack of voices trailed off. I didn  t relax again until I heard screams much later  far up the valley and then from the mountaintop on the other side. Just passing through  I thought. Later  just after I had settled into my tent  my tentmate asked   Did you hear that ? Even though I had my sleeping bag pulled back from my ears because I had heard a shuffling in exactly the place he described I replied   No   hoping it would go away. I lay there on my back watching the fires orange glow and then  BLACK! A silhouette had eclipsed our fire and was squatted in front of the tent! I caught a scream in my Adam  s apple for fear I might frighten the creature into... who knows what. It was so close! I could feel it  s breath pushing against the nylon and a warm stentch filling the air. Five clear digits groped at the zipper in curiosity. I could sense the way a German Shepard senses the fear of an adolescent  that the sasquatch knew that I knew he was there  and that I was literally scared pissless! I had to go before he arrived but held it all night! The shadow gave way to the familiar warm glow of the fire just as it had arrived. In the morning I actually found some hairs (thin black hairs with silver tips) and a few deep pot holes on the trail that were pushed in by something heavy. Before the encounter I was a skeptic. Now I feel Dr. Krantz  s idea of families is exactly what we encountered. (I saw a documentary after the incident) I also feel I  sensed  the intelligence  compassion and even mischevious sense of humour that these animals possess. Please don  t take this as a joke  at least I believe every word of what I said. Yes I do kick myself for not collecting the hair/photographing the indentations or even swallowing my fear and moving an inch to peak outside!!!!! I would like to say that I think it was a family of bigfoot  possibly migrating. They were definitely communicating with one another  even if it was only grunts  they got the point across. ,Bridge Camp or Stewart  s Fork ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Spring ,6105,no
388,A creature was observed in dim light at a range of approximately 15 feet. The creature had an observable stature of at least 8 feet  but the head itself was never seen. The creature was illuminated by the peripheral glare of our Mazda Navajo  s low beams as my wife was loading the car from the passenger side door. We have photographic evidence of the creature in the form of footprints found along the road side above the campsite which clearly show a difference between an uphill gate and a downhill gate. The creature seemed to walk down  then up a small distance  and then down to cross the road. It left a great variety (about 20 or so) of prints in different positions of locomotion over the terrain. We have photos of this trail as well as closeups of the clearer prints with a measurement reference next to them. The events where as follows  My wife and I were returning to our campsite from dinner at a restaurant in Lewiston at about 10 00 p.m.. As we entered the campground we noticed that our campsite was disturbed. For being a windless night  there was no reason our 8 man dome tent should have been on its side with the contents spilled out on the ground and under the tent itself. We are in the habit of keeping everything in either the car or tent when we leave so there was nothing else to mess up there. Another thing is that the tent was zipped up when we left and now was open. We parked and inspected the area around the sit to see if anything was missing. After everything was accounted for  we decied that it must have been restless teens from the area just having  fun.  At this point we decided to pack up and get a hotel room in town. Now this is important; my wife and I had been camping already for about three weeks as we were on a vacation. We had decided early on that if we saw or heard anything (like a bear  etc...) we would just say to the other calmly   as fast as you can  please go to the car.  My wife and I uprighted the tent and she grabbed the pillows and took them to the car as i started to roll up our sleeping bags. After being gone for about a two minutes i heard her say  Steven  as fast as you can  please just get to the car with the keys!  She said it calmly but I instantly could tell there was something really wrong with her. I dropped everything and just went to the car  started it and we backed up and drove to the entrance of the campground.. Now this is what she saw. As she was putting the pillows in the backseat of our truck on the passenger side door (the camp was on the drivers side) she saw some movement off in her peripheral vision in the glow of the headlights about 15 feet from her. At first she thought it may have been a deer as we had seen several earlier that day in the area and so she calmly closed the door enough to shut of the interior light and looked at the area of the movement. The creature then appeared to stand up and started to walk away from her direction toward the rivers edge. She only saw it for about 2 secondes but saw a definate human like shape and (mostly its back and left shoulder) and the impression of brown coloring. We also both recall a strong odor in the area that we could smell at times but never paid any attention too. We discussed what happened (she was almost hysterical with fear) and I turned the car around and drove back and around the site with my highbeams on. One feels a slight bit invincible in a big vehicle  even from big animals. We saw nothing  but nevertheless we put everything in the car without even packing it and left. That night we ended up driving to  I believe  Redding which is 30 miles or so away and staying there in a hotel. The next day  we returned with a camera (a Kodak disposable 35mm.) to the site and explored. We have shots of myself standing where it stood with my hand held up at the level she saw its shoulders and lucky enough it was under a major branch of a tree. The propotions of this thing really amazed us when we realized its size next to the tree. It apperantly had approached and squatted at the base of this tree and watched us  and we are sure that it was what had gone through our tent and that we probably had startled it by retuning when we did. After those photos were taken and a search for footprints was given a go ( the earth there was very  very hard and gravelly) we decided to look up by the road as there was a good enbankment running along its length that the thing had to have crossed to get to our site. About a quarter mile up the road toward the damn from our campsite was a trail as plain as day on the hill side. We got complete photos of the trail and several shots of a very clear print near the asphalt itself on level land. it is about 1 inch deep there where i (at 150lbs) did not leave a trace of one myself. Again  we got several photos of this. ,This incident occurred about 1 mile below the Lewiston river damn in a park service campground that was still closed for the season at the time. This gis about 5 miles up the road from the town of Lewiston  California I remember specifically that there is a fire base camp on the hill above the campsite. I do not remeber the county name  but I can get it for you if you cannot locate it yourself. ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Spring ,6105,yes
389,It was about 1 00 a.m. and I heard the most scariest howl that echoed through the mountains. I have been backpacking in the mountains in northern California 4 times a year for the past 10 years and have never heard anything like it. Bigfoot was the first thing that crossed my mind  as to what it might have been. ,Trinity County  Weaverville  near the Weaver Valley fire look-out in the Trinity Alps. ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Summer ,6105,no
390,On Thursday  10-30-98  at about 1230 hours  I arrived at the Yolla Bolla District Ranger Office of the Trinity National Forest.  I had planned a solo five-day backpacking trip to the area of  Post Mountain and Mud Springs (40 DEG 20   00  North 123 DEG 13    00 ; West) within the Trinity National Forest. I had just relocated to California from Hawaii and was eager to get back into the forest.  I had seen a sensationalized Bigfoot story on a local Sacramento TV station  about a group of hunters that had an encounter within the Trinity National Forest  near a landmark called Mud Springs.  I grew up in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest  so I knew of Sasquatch while growing up  and was always interested in the phenomenon. I planned my trip carefully  because of the time of year (Fall)  my relative unfamiliarity with the region  and because I was making the trip solo.  Solo backpacking trips need to have a carefully laid itinerary in case of problems  so rescuers have a means of finding you. ARRIVAL AT RANGER STATION When I arrived at the ranger station  I was pleasantly greeted by the staff  signed into the visitors log and provided them with a copy of itinerary and emergency contact information.  Being a former police officer  the conversation between the rangers and I was very relaxed - we talked shop for a while.  When they noted my destination on the itinerary  the rangers asked if I was going into the area in response to the Bigfoot sighting.  I told them I was interested in what was seen  and asked for their opinion of the sighting.  All four of the rangers stated that Bigfoot was just as real as the bears  deer and cougar within the park.  Two of the rangers said they had been up to the location and found a set of tracks.  They also stated that finding tracks  is not all that uncommon  and that there have been casts of the tracks made in the past. CHANGE OF PLANS & WRONG MUD SPRINGS I then learned that many there are two locations within the park called Mud Springs  and that my itinerary was for the wrong location!  The rangers told me that many visitors were going to the wrong location  and that they had not corrected them. I laid down my map  and the rangers helped me plan a new itinerary for my trip.  To the correct Mud Springs (40 DEG 21   30  North / 123 DEG 08   30 ; West) on South Dubakella Mountain. The plan was now to spend the night in the hunter  s camp  and leave my vehicle there.  The next day I would set out on foot.  It was already too late in the day to set out.  I would never make it to the second camp  before nightfall  and trying to find a safe place to camp in the dark is not smart. ARRIVAL AT MUD SPRINGS I arrived at the Mud Springs campsite  on 10-30-1998  at about 1400 hours.  The site had obviously been used by hunters.  There was a 4 diameter wood pole lashed between two trees at a height of about 7-8  .  It was obviously used to suspend the deer for gutting and skinning.  There was a large fire ring that had recently been used  and the normal debris that idiots leave at campsites  burnt tin cans  nylon cord  etc.. THE SPRING After setting up my tent  and gathering wood for a fire  I walked over to the spring that was about 30-40 yards away.  I was very impressed by the amount of water that was trickling from the spring  and by the abundance of animal prints  droppings and scat.  This is obviously the main watering hole in the area. Early autumn is typically the driest time of year.  Streams  creeks  rivers and lakes are at their lowest levels.  The water from this spring only flows down from it  s source about 50 yards before disappearing into dry sand and rocks. My impression was that if all the other animals come here to drink so does Biggie.  And with the hunter  s campsite so close to the spring  that may be why Biggie was displaying such aggressiveness.  That spring might serve as both his hunting ground and his water supply.  Both of which are valuable to a nomadic creature. THE ENVIRONMENT The whole area was extremely quiet  even in late afternoon/dusk when many animals begin to venture out.  I saw only two ravens and a couple blue jays  the entire time I was there.  No squirrels  no deer  and no noise. As many of you know  the forest has solitude but is far from silent. BEDTIME I had made a small fire that evening.  I do not normally make a fire when backpacking  but because I had a fire ring available  a plentiful supply of deadwood and it had been years since my last trip  I decide to enjoy one. I turned in at about 2150 hours  and was asleep within minutes. AWAKENED BY SNAPPING BRANCH At about 2230 hours/10-30-1998  I was awakened by the sound of a large snapping branch.  It was not a branch falling  and the branch gave a cracking noise that made it sound like it was a thick branch.  Even though my eyes snapped open with the sound  I just laid in my sleeping bag listening.  I didn  t move. Then with my head close to the ground resting on my ground pad  I heard it.  Not the clop of hooves or the padding of paws  but the dull  vibrating thud of footsteps!  I nearly defecated in my sleeping bag.  I was keenly aware of what I was hearing  and I could feel the adrenaline in my veins. The footsteps where to the northeast of my tent  when first detected.  My hearing was trained in that direction because that is the same direction I heard the branch snap too.  I estimated them to be 10 to twenty feet away  judging from the vibration and sound.  Two more steps and the thing making them  was in front of my tent  about 5-10 feet away. Then the footsteps faded to the southwest with two more footsteps. I was laying there scared to death  thinking about what I was going to do  when all of a sudden  my pots down at the kitchen moved and clanged together!  I was not imagining anything now  and knew it was not a dream!  I grabbed my headlamp and illuminated my tent  trying to drive off my visitor. After I waited about two minutes  I looked out my tent and saw nothing.  I pulled on my boots and walked to my kitchen area.  There I found my nested cookware pots unnested  and spread out.  What ever unnested those pots had thumbs! GONE WITH THE WIND That was all the evidence needed to convince a former policeman and combat hardened Marine that he was out of his element at the moment.  I had only been chased out of a campsite once before  and that was by a mama grizzly and her cubs in the Silver Skagit Valley of Washington State.  This was far more terrifying. A HAIR IS FOUND The pots and pans were sitting next to my backpack.  I left it outside the tent near the kitchen  and bear-bagged my food in a tree about 50 yards away to prevent bears from coming into my camp.  The backpack was brand new  and did not have any food odor in it.  And since there were no squirrels or evidence of rodents  I just left it on the ground propped against a log in the kitchen area.  The pots were about 2 feet away from the backpack. After dropping my tent  and rolling up my sleeping bag  I went to put them in the lower portion of my backpack.  When I reached for the Velcro closure there was a big hair stuck to the Velcro! The hair  which is in my hands now  as I write this  is approximately 5.5 inches long  from root to tip and dark brown in color.  As you get closer to the tip of the hair  the color changes to reddish/orange.  It is somewhat course in appearance  about 3 times the diameter of a human hair. I collected the hair and placed it in a Ziploc bag. HEADED BACK TO RED BLUFF I threw everything in my Ford Explorer and drove all the way to Red Bluff  before I finally calmed down.  It is not something I will ever forget. ,Mud Springs  a hunters campsite with a freshwater spring  near the intersections of USFS roads 29N73 and 29N32 and 29N48 (they all meet)...

391,I am not sure I have anything to report  but cannot quit thinking about an experience I had this August 2000 in the Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California in Trinity County.  I grew up near there so am not easily  spooked  by nature  s noises.  While camping with my family  my husband and I heard this very strange noise off in the distance.  It was weird enough for me to ask him   What was that?   He did not know either.  Having grown up in the mountains  I ruled out coyotes (we heard a pack of coyotes every other night we camped but not that night)  foxes  and mountain lions.  I do not (or should I say have not believed) in the legendary Bigfoot.  My father was a timberfaller for nearly 30 years and never experienced any Bigfoot sightings  so I am not sure what to make of this strange sound.  To give you an idea of the indescribable noise  my husband  s first impression was it was a bear that got hit by a car  although we did not hear a car for three days.  But after listening to the taped scream from Del Norte County  CA  the recorded sound was very similar to what we heard except it went on for hours.  I had my husband listen to it this morning and did not show him what it was  just had him close his eyes and listen to the recording and he agreed the sound we heard this summer was similar to the recording.  I am trying to rule out the Bigfoot possibility  that is why I am going to your organization.  This all happened on a full moon which further adds to the spookiness.  It lasted from about 10 30 at night until about 3 am.  It started to the left of out camp (no other campers around  as we do not stay in campgrounds) and got closer.  When it was directly across from our camp (all the while traveling along the rocky river bar) the noises stopped.  But what is strange is our four dogs started acting scared and started to dig to get inside the tent.  They whimpered  and having a Jack Russell  black lab and two dachshunds  acted out of character.  The did not bark at the noise which is what they would have done had it been an animal. They acted afraid.  Then the noise started on the right of the camp for quite some time  then started getting closer again. Again ceasing when it was across from our camp sight.  It went off to the left and quit about 3am.  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up  and I don  t think I want to  see  what mande those noises  and like I said I haven  t been able to get it out of my mind.  I would like to find a simple answer to the sound.  As a side not  I had a video camera with me  but was too afraid to get out of the tent and go to the truck to get it!  ,We were at a campsite located at Three Forks  which is near the source of the Mad River.  We were just off the paved road about thirty yards. ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Summer ,6105,no
392,I was deer hunting last weekend when I noticed some tracks. I followed the tracks to a hidden waterhole in a very dry place where you would not normally find water. The tracks measure about 16 inches long and 10 inches wide. there are at least 50 oor more tracks leading up the hill. I think I found some of his dung and it was very hard on the outside and still semi-soft on the inside  and it has a very one of a kind smell. It does not smell bad  it almost smells sweet. I have been hunting these woods for over 20 yrs  never have I seen anything like this.  I do have some of the dung with me in a ziploc bag if someone would like to test it. The tracks look as if he is still using them over and over again because the area is very dry and when you step in the tracks it is real quiet. The water hole was a little murky but could have been other animals but I believe I might have just missed him! ,Out by Lewiston Lake ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Fall ,6105,yes
393,I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area  the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people  our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks  we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call  we were setting up camp close to a river  about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when  a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent  but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest  hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark  long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us  with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running  taking long strides  and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them  but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little  there was a clearing  where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise  no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be. I have heard many stories about Bigfoot  and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. ,In the Shasta/Trinity Forest ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Fall ,6105,yes
394,Was hiking/running the Stuart Fork trail (Trinity Alps)yesterday  and came upon about a dozen footprints right where the trail enters Morris Meadows. The trail gets very heavy use (tho didnt see anyone yesterday) so the prints are most likely a prank or maybe superimposed boot prints  but they interested me enough to make this report (i personally dont believe in bigfoot). They werent very clear  but each print was about 15  long and the they were a good 4+ feet apart. They were much deeper than surrounding boot prints  which is what caught my attention. I took a few photos; ill send you a copy when they get developed. ,right on trail  where trail first breaks into open meadow--about 50 ft or so of prints; the trail surface becomes too hard to sustain prints before and after the tracks  so i couldnt follow them very far. ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Fall ,6105,no
395,In Feb. 1977  a friend  his two older brothers  and his younger cousin and I went backpacking in the Trinity Alps area near Shasta Ca.  I was 17 at the time  and would regularly take time off from high school with my parentâ€™s permission to go on camping trips as long as I kept my grades up.  I do not remember the exact date  s as it has been nearly 26 years since the trip. My friend and his brother had camped at the area the previous year in the Trinity Alps.  We departed from our homes in Whittier and Pico Rivera  Ca. in a newer model popup camper Volkswagen bus driven by one brother  and a   69 VW bus driven by the other brother.  Since I was not driving I do not recall the highways or road to the campground that we took  and I no longer have contact with my friend and his family. I remember it took around 10 hours to get there.  We had to turn off the main highway on to a dirt road that we had to drive approximately 10 to 15 miles in order to reach the campground.  On the way to the campground on the dirt road there was patches of snow on the ground but the road was very drivable. About 8 miles on the dirt road we saw an older model VW Beetle coming towards us and we flagged it down  so we could ask the driver what the conditions were like at the campground.  The driver was alone and appeared to be in his mid to late 20s.  He had long hair and a beard and he appeared to be very nervous and distracted when he spoke to us.  He said   that the fishing was good along the river  and thatâ€™s about all I remember him saying besides  good luck and for us to be careful  before driving off.  The whole conversation only took about 2 minutes.  We continued on towards the campground and I remember us kidding to each other how weird the guy had acted as if something had frightened him. When we got to the camp area we saw that there was no other campers around and no sign of any recent visitors.  We set up camp by parking the   69 VW parallel to the river about 25 feet from the bank that led to the river and by parking the other bus the other way about 20 feet away from the   69 bus with the fire ring between the two vehicles.  The popup VW was parked with it  s rear bumper facing the base of a long hill and the front facing the river about 45 feet from the river.  The campground was in a very remote and densely forested area nestled between large mountains in every direction. We set up camp and decided to go for a hike.  We hiked about five miles into a very primitive area along a trail that was hard to follow in some areas.  After awhile we came upon an old cabin.  The cabin appeared to be abandoned for some time by the shape it was in.  One of the brothers was able to get the door open and we all went inside.  There was a few old cans of food  an old rusted shotgun  old blankets  and an old gas lantern.  There were rodent droppings throughout the cabin  and we figured that it possibly was used by seasonal hunters.  We closed up the cabin  and continued our hike.  It was getting late so we decided to sleep under the stars that night instead of hiking back to the campground in the dark. I remember that it was one of the coldest nights I had ever been through as my frozen boots that I had left outside of my tent attested to in the morning. We hiked back to our camp the next morning  and prepared breakfast  and just kind of relaxed all day.  Later in the afternoon we took our guns out  and had target practice on some tin cans.  At night we made a huge fire in the pit  listened to music on the tape deck and talked about the day.  We all headed for bed around 9 30 or 10 00 that night. The cousin and I slept up in the canvas pop-top of the bus  while my friend and the older of his two brothers slept below on the foldout bed.  The other brother slept with his dog in the other bus. Around 10 30 I remember I was almost asleep when I heard a noise coming from far above on the hill next to us.  I then heard something moving at a high rate of speed coming down the hill towards us.  Suddenly the whole bus started rocking back and forth from side to side and at one point I thought it was going to tip over.  I remember hanging on tight and then worrying that if the bus did roll over that I may be crushed if the popup collapsed so I dove for the floor of the bus  and a second later the cousin landed on top of me.  The bus stopped rocking suddenly and I remember hearing over our screams a lot of noise just outside of our vehicle.  We then heard yelling coming from the other brother in his bus and his dog barking like crazy.  We tried looking out the windshield and the side windows but it was iced up and fogged up from the cold.  In a second it was dead quiet again.  We rolled down the passenger side window and called out to the other brother if he was ok.  He said that he was and we all slowly got out of the buses.  The brother in our bus had grabbed his 44 Magnum  and led the way out.  The first thing I noticed was that all of our backpacks had been flung about the camp and that my pack and the cousins pack had been torn open and the contents of our packs was strewn everywhere.  We left everything where it was  and we all crammed into the popup bus for the rest of the night.  Needless to say we barely slept that night. The next morning we cleaned up the mess outside  and speculated on what could have attacked us. The whole attack lasted only a few minutes.  We ruled out a bear because there were no bear tracks. And a bear would have still been in the area.  I climbed the hill behind our bus that I heard whatever it was that had come after us  and I noticed long skid marks that started higher than I could climb  but I saw no footprints.  I tried to match the stride of the skid marks coming down the hill but couldn  t because of the steepness of the hill and the space between the skid marks. We went on with our day by preparing and eating breakfast  and later going for a short hike  and again shooting our guns at targets.  I think that we were all a little edgy after the attack  and I know I kept looking around and over my shoulder whenever possible. Later that night we again sat around the campfire  and listened to music  and talked.  And again we went to bed around the same time.  We kept the same sleeping arrangements and I remember being jumpy at every little sound that I heard outside.  Once again I remember that I was almost asleep when again I heard a noise coming from high above us.  I then heard something rolling down the hill towards us  and the back of our bus being hit by some large object.  I remember all of us saying something like  oh no  not again .  I then heard the same sounds as the night before coming fast at us from the hill.  This time I didn  t wait  and I dove for the floor  and again the cousin landed on top of me.  And once again the bus started to rock violently from side to side for about 30 seconds.  My friendâ€™s brother had kept his 44 near him  and he was waving it around at the windows  and I remember thinking that one of us may get shot by accident.  When the shaking stopped we again heard the other brother yelling from his bus and his dog going nuts.   We tried to see through the iced over windows again with no success.  We exited our bus as soon as we were sure the attacks were over  and called out to the other brother who said he was ok.  I remember the strong smell of something for a short while.  With our flashlights beaming we conducted a brief search of the immediate area. This time our packs were undisturbed.  We walked to the back of our bus  and there was a large rock about 3 feet in diameter wedged between the rear bumper  and the back tire on the driverâ€™s side.  One side of the rock had a very pointed edge to it  and it was inches from the tire.  Whatever had attacked us had thrown the boulder down first before it began its attack on us.  We then noticed that the other bus that the brother was in  which was the closest to the river  had been either pushed or dragged about 5 feet towards the river.  Whatever had attacked us had been very fast and extremely strong  to have attacked so quickly  and to have moved a whole VW bus by itself.  Again I don  t remember getting much sleep that night  and the next morning we cut our trip short by packing everything up  and getting the hell out of there. Ironically the first campground that we came to was the Bigfoot RV Park not far down the main highway if that helps with the location at all. We stayed there for the night and used the showers to clean up  and we slept for 12 hours straight as I recall before leaving for home the next day. I remember not having to drive too far to where there was a statue of Bigfoot in a town called Red Bluff or something like that on the way home. I am 43 years old now  and I have only told this story to a few people including my wife and three kids.  My friends and I never really talked about it when we got back from our trip only because it was so surreal  and I personally thought that people would think that I made it up  or I was insane or something.  I remember for a long time after the trip that I would still get the chills if I was home alone  and I would think about the attacks.  To this day I really don  t have any idea what it was up there.  I have thought about everything that it could have been including that crazy looking guy we met on our way to the campground but it would have been impossible for him to match the strength and quickness that I witnessed those two nights.  I don  t believe in supernatural forces  monsters  aliens  and creatures that have never been discovered. I consider myself an intelligent man  and a reasonable person.  I see enough in the real world as a peace officer to believe in fairytales.  I am only writing about my adventure because I saw the article on bigfoot on AOL  and decided to check out the web site.  I thought it would be fun to share my incident with you.  To this day I am not saying that we were attacked by a bigfoot  because we never saw anything to support that claim.  I am only saying what I am saying  and that we were attacked twice by some unknown man or animal  with enormous quickness  stealth and strength. The next year my friend went back to the same campground with his brother and another friend  and no further incidences occurred. I am open to any reasonable explanation  but I don  t lose any sleep over this after all these years.  I just thought this would interest you. ,West on highway 299  about 14 miles west of Weaverville  Ca. then go north on the Hobo Gulch Rd. ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Winter ,6105,yes
396,It was approx. 2 a.m. on a cool dark quiet night.  My wife  kids  and me were all in rear of trailer sleeping  which we had rented for the week. We had opened the windows all around the trailer  because it was hot earlier  but left them open after we fell asleep.  I was in a deep sleep  when literally my wife starts smacking and pulling at my arm  as I  m abruptly awoken  she begins frantically telling me in soft hurried controlled panic â€there is something outsideâ€  I cracked my eyes and was conscious  I heard what she said  but was either not believing what she said  or that she wasn  t lying  and something was really outside.  In her words she heard padded steps for a minute  before she woke me up. Then what got me was when something stepped on our outside trailer step  and put pressure on the step  which caused the trailer to move.  Well  by this time we were both sitting up in our bed  and hanging on every whim  listening in the night.  My wife was so scared; she said  â€œIf that door opens I  m going to scream so loud I swear.â€  At that moment  it was surely a strange eerie feeling  and I remember anticipating the door opening  and how helpless I felt.  I was sweating seriously  because something inside of me was telling me that I did not want to confront what was outside. Daisy  my beautiful Jack Russell dog we brought along who barks at everything  and is always alert  was in the front part of the trailer sleeping on the couch.  It was quiet the whole time not making a peep  and when we looked at her  she was like right  no way am I going out there!  In the morning we asked our friends if they heard anything  or were you playing around at night?  But  with paying it no mind they said  no!   But  I knew it was not in their character.  I just don  t know what else that would be so bold to actually go right to our trailer? ,Well  from Bay area take I-5 north to Hwy. 299 then go west on Hwy. 3 North. The campground is right off the road. It was a very long and winding road  and it takes 6 hours to get to from home. It was a long and beautiful ride. ,Trinity,20,California ,CA,Summer ,6105,yes
397,I have been backpacking in the Trinity Alps for 12 years and have ran into many bears and even mountain lions but this experience was much different. My wife  brother  and another friend of ours went packing to Bear Lake in the trinity alps. It was our last night and we were the only ones at the lake. Since it was in August fire wood was scarce and we had none for our last night. We sat in our dark camp until about midnight then everyone wanted to sleep. My brother and our friend shared a tent and my wife and I shared one. I lay in my tent and couldn  t sleep. I looked at the time and it was 1 30 am. My wife was asleep and I heard what I thought was my brother walking around in camp. It walked around for at least a minute so I whispered my brothers name to see if it was him but it kept walking around and not responding which made me very nervous. I heard the steps getting closer to my tent and I started to smell a horrible animal stench. I had left my backpack leaning against a log about 15 feet from our tent. Whatever it was walked over and picked up my pack off the ground and was holding it above my tent. I could see the shadow of something very large  standing outside the tent trying to rip open my pack as it held it above our tent which had no food in it.  Our food pack was up in a tree on the other side of camp with only freeze dried food. I was in such shock I yelled at it and it stood still. My wife  brother  and our friend all woke up from my yelling. My brother was trying to get out of his tent when the animal dropped my pack on top of our tent and ran out of our camp. ,It was Big Bear Lake.

398,Around 1979-----Norm and I hunt the Monache Meadow area  we had camped at Summers Ridge that night. About 2 00 in the  morning  this loud howl of immense volume  coming from one the meadows  yes it did have sad tone to it  but did not seem threatening. We got into the jeep  and started spot-lighting the meadows. After hour of this  the loud howl went away. We re-treated to our camp  for some un-nerving sleep. But ever sence this encounter  our group looks for signs  of this big creature  up on south fork of the Kern River. Then ten years later what happen to bridge builders  3 miles from our encounter. Monache Meadows is at 8 000 ft. High  and very cold at night. The south fork of the Kern River runs thru--it It has lots of deer  bear  cougars  fish and now bigfoot. ,MONACHE  MEADOWS----SOUTH  FORK  KERN  RIVER ,Tulare,19,California ,CA,Fall ,6107,no
399,Sir  A good friend of mine and I were camping up on the Kern Plateau  a massive area 7 000 feet-plus in elevation on the western flank of the Sierra Nevada above the Kern River in late October 1985  (Peppermint Springs Campground is closest location). We had driven by 4X4 truck for approx. 2 miles back in from the highway. We wanted to be alone  away from a formal camping area as we had firearms and planned on doing some  plinking . However  we discovered that there were                other  campers/hunters  in the area-- but none camped close. One gentleman even joined us for dinner  as he hadn  t eaten in a couple of days. He was friendly and said he worked as a handyman in the area during the summer season. As night fell  we heard several vehicles pulling out  going back toward the highway. The temperature began to drop rapidly. Later that evening  perhaps around 8 30 pm  my friend and I were sitting by the campfire sipping beers and listening to a bit of country/western music when suddenly... my friend said to me   Do you hear that?  I turned down the music to listen. What we heard was un-godly. It was a loud  shrill-pitched scream. A combination growl/scream  really  that echoed for miles throughout the woods  and it wasn  t human. At first  I thought it must be some drunken hunter howling at the moon. But  it was far too loud and intense. We listened again.... and again it sounded  this time closer. It was quite simply bone chilling. We immediately turned off the music and grabbed our firearms  rechecked that they were loaded and  frankly  just sat there stunned. We were armed with a 30.06 rifle  a 12-gauge pump shotgun  and a pair of .22 caliber pistols. This did not make us feel secure. It was that profound of an experience  the kind of episode where the hair on the back of one  s neck stands straight up. The entire forest  I mean everything  shut down completely when this creature made those horrific screams. It remained for the rest of the evening. We also felt like something was  close  to us. There was just this subtle  palpable vibe. To put in perspective how spooked we were (because we heard another short series of screams around 11 00 pm) we both slept with the guns literally under our pillows. My buddy refused to sleep by the fire  instead preferring to sleep in the back of my Ford pick-up. I am an experienced bow-hunter/outdoorsman with many years spent in the wilderness hunting and camping. This is the first time I  ve ever related this story in print  although I have told it several times to friends. At first  they laugh  but as I go into detail they can see quite clearly that I  m not exaggerating. This was a very strange incident  indeed. ,Above Kernville  CA  Highway 190 north area--  Peppermint Springs Campground was within several miles of our wilderness camp. ,Tulare,19,California ,CA,Fall ,6107,no
400,I saw what could only be described as a bigfoot several years ago on route to Kennedy Meadows.  I was driving up the dirt road past Grumpy Bear  s place and not too far from Kennedy Meadows--maybe a few miles--where we were later camped.  I believe it was around Memorial Day  1986-88. The sun was setting  and as I looked to the west to glance at it as it began to dip below the mountains  I something caught my eye out in the desert  among the Joshua trees.  At first I thought it was just a Joshua tree; but it was moving the same direction as I was driving--north.  I slowed  and watched it as it ran.  It was probably 100 yards? or so from me. I could tell it was big and tall  had long  dark brown hair.  Its arms were longer than a man  s and I could see the hair flop up and down as it ran.  Its legs appeared to be very muscular and I was impressed by the ease in which it ran--its movement reminded me of a tiger  strong and graceful  although he ran on two legs like a human.  I saw it  s head turn towards me  and I got a chill as I thought this thing is making eye contact with me!  Although I felt fear  I also felt it felt fear towards me.  (Don  t ask me to explain this  but that  s how I felt and I am an intuitive person!)  This was all in a matter of seconds--maybe five.  I turned to my passenger to relate to her what I saw  slowed down some more  but when I looked again to point out the bigfoot  all I saw was Joshua trees and desert.  I felt he was hiding from me. It was really an incredible experience  one that I will always remember. I didn  t stop the car  climb the fence or go after him.  I continued to drive on to the campsite where I told my experience to the rest of the group. A few weeks to a month later  I remember seeing in the Bakersfield Californian an article that a bigfoot was spotted in the Shirley Meadows Campground.  As I understand it  that  s not too far from Kennedy Meadows. , ,Tulare,19,California ,CA,Spring ,6107,yes
401,My brother and I were on backpacking trip in sometime in the mid 1980  s. 1987  if my memory serves me correctly. We were hiking the High Sierra Trail from Bearpaw Meadow over the summit into the Kern River valley. We had made quite a distance the third day out (about 18 miles) and were exhausted when we stopped at a small lake called Morraine Lake high above the Kern River valley. We had seen no other hikers the entire day. As we were sitting in camp at dusk  the quiet was pierced by an unearthly screaming howl of immense volume  emanating from some distance away from us  but carrying quite clearly in the still air. It sounded as if it came from some animal with huge lung capacity  and could not be confused with human  a bear  or any other sound I had ever heard. The outburst only happened once and trailed off rather than stopping abruptly. Although clearly not human  it somehow seemed sad in tone rather than fierce or threatening.  Did you hear that?!  my brother asked.  I sure did   I replied.  What do you think it was?  he then asked.  I have no idea   was my response. We were so tired that we just climbed in the tent and took our chances with whatever was out there. By morning we had forgotten about it. It remained forgotten for days until we got back to civilization and were having a meal of  real food  at a local diner. The newspaper I was reading carried a story about three men who were repairing a footbridge in the Golden Trout wilderness area of the Kern River for the U.S. Forest service. They were experienced woodsmen  one was a 60-year-old Mono Indian. They were frightened severely at dusk one evening by what they described as a nine-foot-tall hairy beast coming down a hillside at them screaming loudly. It was a classic Bigfoot sighting  except it was way out of the normal geographic range for sightings  since the Sierra Mountain range was not believed to be a typical Bigfoot area. They fired a shot over its head with a 30.06 rifle  and were so upset that they packed out to a Ranger Station that night and made a report to the ranger. The ranger scoffed at them  and surmised that they had seen a bear or cougar. They replied that they knew what bear and cougars looked and sounded like  and that THIS creature was different. Way different! The ranger accompanied them the next morning to the sight and saw some large footprints in gravel  but nothing like a cast could be made from. I checked the day and place that these men said this happened and you guessed it  it was the same day that my brother and I heard this weird screaming howl  perhaps 5-8 miles away. I never reported this to anyone  but you can have this for your files and maybe if you piece enough of these small events together you can come up with a bigger picture.

402,I thought a saw a bear in the middle of the road; then it stood up and ran on two feet and jumped a nearby barbed-wire fence and kept running into the woods until it was gone. ,Just south of Three Rivers  California  about 3 miles up the South Fork Road.

403,This is not a sighting report. But it is a report.  My name is Steve High. I read the anonymous sighting report you have posted for Three Rivers  CA  in Tulare County. I work in Visalia  the closest major town to that area and am familiar with Three Rivers. I had business to attend to there last Monday (8/8/99) and afterwards scoped out the area of the story and spoke to 2 locals. The area of the sighting was easy to find as there is only one bridge in that area and it is indeed silver [in color]. The vegetation there is heavily riparian and even unusual. Blackberries  poison oak  willows  sycamore and live oaks are in an amazing and dense tangle. The berry bushes and poison oak is a daunting floor  wall and canopy up to about 15 feet and quite thick and intimidating. Visibility in the field of the vegetation is perhaps 20 to 30 feet. It is possible to be completely out of sight of the road within just 5 feetof the road on either side. Of note is that this is a riparian habitat and only extends to the bottom of the canyon  which in the area of the bridge would give it a width of perhaps 50 yards. Other places upstream and down  it widens to perhaps 200 yards.This vegetation gives way abruptly to normal foothill trees and grasses with wide and steep expanses of open terrain where a coyote would have difficulty hiding. It is really a quite striking contrast. Also  there is little to no water above ground in the stream area at this time of year and it becomes drier up through October. The rains begin here in November. My observation is that the vegetation and terrain and the dry stream bed would afford a hidden passage for any animal up to the size of a large elk travelling up or down the canyon. My speculation is that Three Rivers is about as far down the canyon as any animal would get and still be useen  as this blanket of vegetation falls off rapidly into the highway and opens up to Kaweah Lake. However  going UP the canyon  the area winds about and becomes seriously more rugged and difficult to travel over the next 15 miles and extends up into Sequoia National Park. There is no hunting in the park and it would be a natural game path for animals as diverse as racoon  deer  black bear  fox and mountain lion to travel. I saw no reason why a Bigfoot could not also take this same trip. What should also be mentioned is that there are three homes rather impossibly nestled in the undergrowth. One is below the bridge and two above. All three showed signs of a full family living there year round. A large animal or even a poacher would have to come out of the undergrowth and cross the road in this vicinity OR risk detection from one of the homes. Of the 2 locals I spoke to  one was a deputy who had lived up there his entire life and who was actively involved with the search and rescue unit. I asked him plainly what his opinion was of the Bigfoot sighting last August [1998]. He said that it was the first he  d heard of that. Also  that if something like that had really happened that EVERYONE in town would know about it by the following morning. He believed it was likely a story put out by one of the citizens to entice more people to drive up the road as tourism to Sequoia had been slow. An acountant listening in seconded the opinion. Both men were locals and were certain that there was no truth to it  even as a rumor. I then asked them if they had EVER heard tale of a Bigfoot sighting in Three Rivers. They said they had not. They were in fact incredulous that I might be taking such a thing seriously. They both said that it could have been Deputy B_____ as he was 6-ft-6 and often wandered about town. He was the closest thing they had to a Bigfoot. So  what we have here at best is a very quiet sighting that was not mentioned to law enforcement or the press  or at worst a fiction. If it were a rumor put out to generate interest and get more people to drive up to the area  it failed. I will also check with the local newspaper for the dates following the sighting and see what they have to say.

404,My sighting was in May of 2000 on the Tule River Indian Reservation in Porterville CA.  I worked on the reservation at this time at the end of the paved road (very remote)  my secretary (who is a member of the tribe) and I stepped outside for a break.  My secretary spotted it first on the mountain behind our office.  She pointed it out to me  it was a large hairy mammal standing in front of a rock about 100 yrds away with it  s left arm extended upward holding on to a rock ledge.  It was easy to see and make out the animal  s face and eyes.  We watched it for about 10 minuets but then my secretary got scared so we went back into the office.  She then told me that her people believed that the bigfoot was sacred and that they lived at the area we had saw the bigfoot and that they help to carry their dead through this mountain to the other side.  I then went back out side and it was gone. ,Tule River Indian Reservation  Porterville CA. ,Tulare,19,California ,CA,Spring ,6107,yes
405,My incident was not a sighting of an actual Big Foot creature  but of footprints. My father and I were camping at Kennedy Meadows Campground on the South Fork of the Kern River in California. On April 24  2001 - we had cross the stream to do some hiking  but could not cross back the same we had came. We decided to go upstream to see if there were any better crossing points  or cross the bridge which was much further upstream. About 2 miles upstream from the campgrounds we found a suitable place to swim across  then we proceeded uphill to look for the Pacific Crest Trail which leads back to the campground. We figured we were probably within a quarter of a mile from the trail which runs parallel to the river. While walking through the forest looking for the trail  I happened to look down and noticed some unusual tracks. I called my father over to look at them as well  and to provide confirmation that I was not just  seeing things . What we saw were footprints which looked approximately 12 inches long and probably 5 or 6 inches wide in the shape of a human foot. The print had 5 toes - with the big toe having the most prominent print. The foot did not seem to have the concave pattern on the inside which would indicate an arch - it seemed almost square in shape. I considered the possibility that these prints could be a hoax  however  at that point  we had not yet found the trail and it turned out that we were still about 100 feet from it. The prints we saw were in the forest between the river and the PC trail and actually looked as though they could have been travelling parallel to the trail. We could not determine the age of the print. It had rained probably 5 days earlier and the print had been made after the rain  but did not look much older than a day or two. This is all the information I can remember at this point  but I am anxious to go back to see if I can find more footprints. ,Take the Kennedy Meadows exit from Highway 395 (I don  t remember the road name or number) and drive about 22 miles up into the mountains.

406,In May or June of 2001  3 friends of mine and I camped out near Mineral King at the top of a saddle between two mountain peaks. We camped in the woods nowhere near a campsite of any kind-near no one else. We had hiked all day to get to that spot. In the middle of the night-around 1AM I guess- huge rocks (sounded like boulders because we could hear flying debris when they hit) began to rain down around us. None of them seemed close enough to actually hit our tents-and I got up many times to see what could  ve done it. The geography or lay of the land around us was such that there werent any cliffs or anything like that to create the momentum necessary for such force. The other odd thing is that it went on for a few hours-maybe 3 then stopped. Another discomforting issue was that the whole way up and the whole time pitching camp and even the early evening it was quiet as could be. I never saw anything although on the side of our makeshift camping area I saw one deer-opposite from where the noise came from. We thought of everything-ice cracking rock dislodging rock fall-but couldnt answer the timing of it-nor the fact that there wasnt enough of a grade anywhere near us to cause such a thing. In addition to the rocks-there were very loud cracking of branches. I cant remember if it was the large rocks hitting trees or if it was breaking of branches and large rocks seperately. I never heard any  screams  or anything-but something made alot of racket that night. We were all terrified-and my friend has been an avid hiker who  s hiked in different parts of the US and never experienced anything like this. As much as it made an impression on us-no one really likes to talk about it-nor did anyone have an answer. Two of us mentioned that we should speak to a Park Ranger. Ive been meaning to contact one but I never got around to it. Your title made it easier for me  because I frankly don  t know what to think. I can  t imagine the force it would take to have rocks rain down around us like that-nor could I possibly justify to myself why it never happened ever around us all day-in the morning  nor early evening or after the incident. I  ve been interested in going back to that same location-but have fallen out of touch with the only friend willing. ,This was in the Sequoia National Park.  All I can say for now is that on the way there  we passed a lake  then turned off onto a road into the woods. It took us a long time  we crossed a very old bridge  and the parking area we left our car at had marmot warnings. Apparently they eat into hoses or belts on the car. People had chicken wire and such to keep them out. ,Tulare,19,California ,CA,Summer ,6107,no
407,I was camping in the backcountry of Sequoia National Park. Just after sunset  I heard numerous repeated screams. They were not human and I have never heard an animal that made that sound. I have been camping and backpacking in those woods for 20 years and I have never heard anything like that. It sounded almost identical to some supposed bigfoot screams that have been recorded over the years. It sounded like a combination of a man yelling  a woman screaming and a dinosaur roaring all wrapped into one sound. It went on for maybe 30 seconds and abruptly ended. It was a very unnerving noise. ,It was in the South Fork Meadows area in southern Sequoia National Park near the border of the Golden Trout Wilderness area.

408,My family and I were at The Golden Trout Wilderness Packing Station in the lower Sierra  s over the labor day weekend. We were there for horse back riding which we have done for the past 4 years. The time was approximately 4PM when my wife  son  daughter  Sierra(daughter of the owner of the pack station)  and myself became aware of a high pitched  whooping  call coming from a distance down the forestry access road approaching the station. The kids started to call back in the same manner. We all guessed it was an approaching hiker or horse back rider approaching the station and calling out for fun. The calling continued for the next 15-20 minutes and was percieved as getting closer. My son became bored with the game and went on to something else to do. The calling continued and I observed that it passed the station and finally grew faint towards the trail head entering a section of the golden trout wilderness area. My daughter went to the access road just adjacent to the mule packing platform to greet the caller upon their arrival. The call grew louder and that was the reason for her appearence at the road at that time. She observed a being and was afraid of what she saw. When I asked later that evening whom had come down the road she was timid in her response. I thought this odd and continued to question her. She was afraid to tell us what she saw because she thought we would accuse her of lying. She has just turned eight. Her description was as follows with little lead in by myself or my wife. We are both physicians and trained in the scientific method. We tried or best not to  bait  her answers  The thing was bigger than me (>7 foot) and had a long beard. When I asked her what he was wearing she answered nothing. I then asked her what color was his skin and she answered that she could not tell because he was covered with hair. All over I asked  yes  all over. I then asked if his arms were short or long. She answered long. I asked did he see you and her answer was no. I asked if he made the sound we had been hearing and she stated not at the time she saw him. I then described three different gait patterns by example and she picked the long stride and lumbering type verses the noraml human gait or small steps. She stated that he had a big mouth and walked quickly. She was brief and direct with her answers and I believe she saw something not typically human in form. She has no imaginary friends and has been taught that lying will only hurt the one who lies. I was a bit spooked and fearful for my family  s safety for the rest of the night. ,Golden Trout Wilderness Packing Station - it  s web site is under the same name. ,Tulare,19,California ,CA,Summer ,6107,yes
409,My family and I were camping in Monache Meadows  on the north side of Monache Mountain. Sometime late on May 26 or early May 27  my wife and I were startled by loud  echoing whoops. The whooping came in groups of two  a few moments of silence and then another pair. It seemed fairly near  perhaps 100 to 200 yards south of us  toward the slope of the mountain. The whoops were intense and were soon joined by howling coyotes. A chase seemed to erupt and the sounds began retreating away from us. It was not clear whether the coyotes were giving chase or being chased. But as the uproar receded  it sounded as though something was being attacked  given a series of yelps and high-pitched howls. It sounded extremely violent.  Whatever it was   my  wife said the next morning   it was being torn apart.  After a minute or two  the chase faded into the distance. The normal sounds of night returned to the forest. ,Camp was located about 150 yards west of the main Monache trail on the road toward the Monache ranger camp.

410,It was the summer of 1986 and I was camping with a friend in a small campsite where we had been several times before. It was a few hundred yards off the road before Fish Creek campground  near Troy Meadows area on the Kern Plateau  up the road from Kennedy Meadows. The public campground was about 1 Â½ miles as the crow flies from us. I believe it was a Wednesday so there were not many other campers on the mountain  and we were on the first day of a motorcycle riding trip. We had spent the day gathering wood  setting up tents and testing out our old motorcycles. Two friends were to join us the next day. As my friend Bob and I settled in around the campfire  we talked of the loop we were planning to ride the next day. We were camped in a clearing in the trees. There was a large meadow 100 yards on the other side of the trees. Bobâ€™s dog Duke  a large male Irish setter  was taking turns getting petted. It was getting late and we were winding down. Just then we heard it. The sound was part yell  part growl. It was extremely loud and echoed through the valley. Only a very large pair of lungs could have produced the loud  high tones and deep throaty growl. This sound struck fear in me that I will never forget. It continued for several minutes and seemed to be at the edge of the meadow. It is hard to describe the intensity of the sound. The best I can do is to say that it started off sounding like the yell of a howler monkey  fading into the deep growl of an enraged grizzly bear. We stoked up the fire without saying a word to each other. Next we heard a branch break just outside the light of the campfire. I looked at Duke and saw him staring at the area where I had heard the branch break. He was shaking from head to toe. Next we heard leaves move about fifty feet over from the last sound. The dog turned straight at it. Again  it was just out of the light of the fire. Bob and I were scared like never before. Our fear was emphasized by the fact that his large male dog was frozen in fear  fixed on one area in the darkness. By the look in his eyes  I believe he could see what we could not. Several minutes later  the dog slowly broke his stare for a minute. Bob and I were able to talk after this point. All we could come up with to explain the noises was that it was large  not a bear  and very angry by the sound of it. We never calmed down that night. We abandoned the tents and both slept in Bobâ€™s Ford Bronco  Bob with his 357 lying across his chest. The next day  we waited until we heard other cars and far off bikes before we started really walking around. Later our friends arrived and we kept the camp loud all of the next night. I have camped  hunted  fished and rode dirt bikes for my whole life. I have played it cool with bears outside my tent and seen a lot of the backcountry. I also work in the outdoors. I have never heard an animal like what we heard that one night. ,Take Sherman Pass Road past Kennedy Meadows General Store.  Continue on towards Troy Meadows.

411,Loud whooping exchange was heard between at least two  possibly three entities at a range of no more than 500 meters. Deep whooping was projecting from the southwest  with answers coming from the south/southeast. The answer calls came in higher pitches and might have been coming from two different animals. The whoops could at times be described as moaning and other inflected noises I can  t really describe with words. The exchange lasted for about 30 minutes. The higher ptiched calls shifted slightly from SE to E. ,Parker Meadow in the Sequoia National Monument.

412,September 29  2008 Iâ€™m in the mountains above Kernville for opening weekend deer hunting season. I decided to spend the evening on a high mountain ridge so I would not have to climb the mountain in the dark the next morning. I hiked in the afternoon before and pitched my tent just before dark. I pitched my tent on a ridge just down from a high mountain pass. Just before going to sleep I was standing outside my tent and I heard a loud noise behind me. The noise was within forty feet of my position  and I would describe it as a single pop sound. Iâ€™ll try to spell out the sound  but there is no way I can reproduce the sound! â€œPooeekkâ€. It could have been a branch being broken off of a tree but it would have had to come off at the base of the branch where it meets the tree trunk. The tree would have to be slightly hollow to get the sound. There was no noise after the initial sound and nothing ever hit the ground. My first impression of the sound was that it was a warning and I thought it was more of an animal sound  because it had a hollow guttural tone to the pop sound. I dismissed the occurrence and had no other problems through the night. The next morning I got up before sun up and started stocking along the tree line heading toward the mountain pass. After about 75 yards I moved into the trees and sat for some time looking over a meadow. Once I finished my time there I walked in the trees for twenty feet and then I moved out of the trees and back in the open. Just as I stepped out of the trees I spotted a large foot print. It was very large and I could make out two toes at the top left of the print. At this point I took out my cell phone and snapped a picture of the foot print. The foot print was as long as my boot  13â€ long plus the toes and 2â€ wider than my boot on the side. I could make out a ridge in the dirt where the ball of the heal and the middle of the foot come together. After taking the picture I resumed my hunting and I moved along the tree line following the foot prints. They were made by a man like biped creature  the stride was longer than mine are  but I could stretch my stride to match the stride. I followed the prints for about another 75 yards they went right through the middle of the saddle between the two mountains.  At that point I resumed my hunting for deer and dismissed the Bigfoot. The only thing I would add about the prints they were all the same  but I could only see the toes on the first print because that print went slightly into the side of the mound. I will send a copy of the picture once you make contact with me. Both the toes and skin fold mound can be seen in the digital picture. ,The area is located south of the Sherman Pass Road about a one hour drive out of Kernville.

413,Very visual on 8-11-07 at 2 P.M. in southern high sierras along the P.C.T. At 200 yards I watched 2 bigfoot for 10 minutes just walking around within 25 feet of each other by the edge of a deep canyon. After 10 min. I gave them this coyote call I have and within 2-3 seconds they were both gone down into that canyon. No pictures were taken  because my mind  FROZE . So  on 8-6-08 I went back to the exact same place  and found only one thing to bring back home. A chunk of big foot poop the size of a golf ball. Similar to horse poop but definitely NOT horse. So after two years in a row I will go back  as a 3rd time is a CHARM. (Video Camera next time) ,[Location details removed.

415,Hello. My family and I took a trip to the Sequoia National Forest and were walking a trail near the Bear Hill Trail. I was taking pictures and videos of my children when I noticed a couple of footprints up the side of the hill.  The toes and heel indentations were very noticeable  very large and very deep into the dirt. The stride between the prints were approximately 6 feet apart. I also took photos and videos of the prints and with my foot next to them. What was very intimidating was that I am 6  6  and weigh 380 lbs.  so I  m no small guy at all. I wear shoe size 13 extra wide. These prints made my foot look childish. I tried my hardest to dig my foot into the dirt as deep as the prints were  but to no avail. Whatever made these prints had to be a considerably large animal. I then went back to the entrance of the Bear Hill Trail and walked up that trail and matched the area where I found the original prints  but higher up. It was there I found a third print and took a couple of pictures of that print as well  with one being my foot next to it to get the size. I have always been an avid believer in the Sasquatch animal  but I never thought that I would ever find anything like this. ,It was about 50 yards north-west of the Giant Forest Museum and about 20 yards north of the Bear Hill Trail. ,Tulare,19,California ,CA,Summer ,6107,no
416,From the Union Democrat  Monday  January 28  1963  REPORT   10-FT. SHRIEKING MONSTER A horror tale of a 10-foot-tall man led sheriff  s deputies last night into a dark brushy area adjoining Peter Pam subdivision  west of Cold Springs. Officers were unable to spot a monster but returned with an equally horrifying report of unidentified shrieking sounds.  There was definitely some creature in the woods   Deputy William Huntley confirmed.  I  ve never heard anything like it.   Huntley  s partner  Elbert Miller of Cold Springs  a veteran woodsman  agreed   I  ve never heard a sound like that in all my years in the woods.  The search was touched off by an anonymous telephone call to the sheriff  s office about 8 30 p.m.  The caller refused to give his name on grounds   You  ll think I  m crazy and put me in a strait jacket.  He reported seeing a man - at least nine or 10 feet tall - in the road by an old gravel pit north of the Peter Pam tract.  Huntley quoted the caller   It was moving around.  It appeared to be human but was the most awful thing I have ever seen.  Huntley said the caller added   I  m scared.  I  m an adult and I  m not crazy.  I  m not drunk.  I don  t even drink.  Huntley said a second man then came on the phone to confirm the story.  The second man had not seen the monster  Huntley said  but he reported seeing tracks more than 14 inches long. Huntley and Miller then drove to the area.  In first radio dispatches to the Sonora sheriff  s office  they reported hearing sounds something like  a human in distress.   It  s heading right towards the car.  Here it comes   Huntley advised. After a delay  he reported   Now it seems to be circling the car.  It sounds more and more like an animal of some kind.  But the two officers reported they could see nothing in the heavy brush.  Its definitely not a bear   Huntley radioed.   Elbert thinks it  s more possibility a mountain lion  but it  s not a mountain lion noise.  The two officers shouted at the creature and noticed their shouts did not seem to scare it.  As they attempted to move closer  however  the sound seemed to move away. The officers were forced to head back to Cold Springs when the patrol car  s gas supply ran low  but they returned to the spot a short time late and found the unidentified creature still shrieking.  Huntley said they stayed in the area until 1 30 a.m. but were still unable to spot the source of the sounds. The officers returned to the scene after daylight but found nothing to explain the mystery.   There were no tracks  nothing to indicate anything at all   Huntley advised.  He noted the area is brushy and rocky and the ground is frozen. Huntley and Miller report they will return to the area tonight on the chance the creature will pay a second visit. ,Take Highway 108 to Cold Springs. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Winter ,6109,no
417,From the Union Democrat  Tuesday  January 29  1963  PURSUIT LED BY SHERIFF King-sized tracks were traced today in efforts to confirm or halt reports a 10-foot monster is roaming Tuolumne county brushlands. The prints  described as 14 to 15 inches in length  were spotted this morning near the area where Sunday night reports placed a grotesque 10-foot-tall man and repeated shrieking noises.  The tracking party  lead by Sheriff Miller Sardella  reportedly followed prints north of Peter Pam subdivision  through Jenness park and the Sierra Boy Scout camp area below Cold Springs. Tracks were first spotted yesterday by reserve Deputy Elbert Miller  and original reports from the sheriff  s office set the size of the prints at 15 to 17 inches.  Miller lost the trail among cabins in the Jenness park area. Sardella  with Deputies William Huntley and Pete DeMott  returned to the area this morning and spotted additional footprints. Sardella described the tracks as shoe prints  apparently made before last night  s light snowfall.  He said cabins in the area were checked but officers found no evidence of break-ins. The sheriff said they saw fresh mountain lion tracks in the area.  Noting mountain lions will stalk and screech at a human  Sardella suggested a lion as the possible source of noises heard Sunday night by Miller and Huntley. At the time  Miller had described the shrieks as somewhat like a mountain lion but assured   It  s not a mountain lion noise.  ,Take Highway 108 to Cold Springs. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Winter ,6109,no

419,From the Union Democrat   Warren Johnson  his brother Louis  and several friends experienced many unusual experiences above Strawberry  California.  They often found footprints  heard moans  grunts  snarls  snorts  tooth-popping and chest-beating.  Louis Johnson also reported that he had looked out through a hole in the shelter wall  saw a shape enter a patch of moonlight and leave again as soon as he tried to call someone  s attention to it. Johnson estimates the size as 10 feet tall  four feet across the shoulders and as much as 750 pounds. Tracks were found that were 22 inches in length and had a five-foot stride.

420,It was January 1977  and Little Ruben Rios and Danny Mirales had talked Ruben Hernandez  my husband  into taking them snow camping. Ruben had the experience and the equipment  but was reluctant  because neither Rios nor Danny had much camping experience  and had never camped in the snow.  But winter camping prevailed  and they ended up on the boarder of Stanislaus National Forest and the west side of Yosemite National Park... a place that was called Carl  s Inn  then later renamed Carlon. It is located on the South Fork of the Tuolumne River on Evergreen Road.  The road was open in winter possibly due to the fact that it  s on the way to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. It  s not too far  on the map  from Highway 120 and Yosemite  s Big Oak Flat Entrance Station.  It is about 4575 feet elevation. Camping is not allowed there anymore  but we still fish there in the spring and summer. Carlon is in a narrow valley  with ridges on both sides  and the road drops quite a bit between the highway and the stream.  The men had gotten off to a late start because of work  so whatever they could pile into Ruben  s Jeep in a few minutes is what they took.  After awhile  tt was getting dark and Highway 120 was deserted  they hadn  t even seen another car since Buck Meadows. The temperature had dropped and all three agreed to pull over and set up camp at the next level spot  which happened to be an old logging camp road next to a bridge. That  s how they found Carlon  it was not their original destination  just a convenient place off the road. Night had come and it was pitch black by the time they parked. They left the Jeep on a 45 degree up-hill angle on the logging road and blocked it  s tires with the biggest rocks they could lift. There were no signs that anyone had been there for a long time  no garbage in the empty can or even footprints in the snow. When they realized they had forgotten their firewood they had no choice but to try to find some in the forest. This was no easy task  because snow was on the ground and everything was either wet or frozen. So they ended up â€œpruningâ€ the trees in the national forest... the point being that these three guys were making a lot of noise  tromping around and using their ax  going up the mountain to the top of the ridge  chopping and then dragging tree branches down the mountainside by lantern light. The fire was made in the campsite fire ring with much effort  after siphoning some gas out of the Jeep. They had a good fire going and dinner was ready to be prepared.  Mostly canned foods  like Vienna sausages and Dinty Moore stew set directly into the fire.  Unfortunately  the Dinty Moore stew can exploded and sprayed food all over them and a 13-foot diameter circle around the fire (this is important to what happened later). After eating what was left of dinner  the three fell asleep inside their tent. At about 2 30 or 3 00 a.m.  the three campers suddenly awoke to the sound of the crunch-crunch of footsteps (BIG footsteps) in the snow and brush.  Then they heard puffing and snorting and grunting from a creature that sounded like a cross between a gorilla and a pig  and then the blood curdling screams  like â€œer er er AAH-AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!â€ It was coming from the ridge above the campground!  Then more CRUNCH-CRUNCH  CRUNCH-CRUNCH... PUFF  SNORT  GRUNT... â€œER ER ERRR AAH-AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!â€  It was walking around the camp along the ridge where they had been earlier that evening getting their illegal wood. The three men froze with fear  the thing was coming closer! They could hear the thing encircling their campsite!!! They knew they were in big trouble! Ruben recalls that it was such a horrible sounding scream it gave him goose bumps all over  but he needed to keep his wits together because the other two where looking to him for answers. He never let on that he was just as scared as they were of whatever it was that was looming over their camp. He also remembers as all this was happening  his mind was racing with the thoughts â€œMy God  this thing is going to kill us right here  right now! This is how I am going to die!  When the spring thaw comes someone is going to find the remains of what was left of our camp  shreds of tent material  ripped-up sleeping bags  dented pots and pans  busted-up camping supplies and the dead remains of whatever is left of us.â€ Ruben tried to get the other two to be quiet and calm down. He remembered telling them â€œWhatever it is out there can hear every sound we are making! Shut up!!!â€ One just broke down and cried hysterically  repeating over and over â€œWe  re going to die! We are going to die! That thing is going to kill us! We  re going to die!!â€ The other was asking in a freaked-out voice â€œWhat is it  Ruben?!?! Let  s get out of here! Letâ€™s go get in the Jeep and get out of here!â€ Ruben told them there was no way they  d be able to get the rocks away from the tires fast enough  the thing was so close! And even if they could  driving backwards on black ice could roll the Jeep. Ruben told them they would be better off in the tent and remain quiet and wait to see what would happen next. It screamed that way four separate times  about five to ten minutes in between each scream and was in the campground for about an hour. Ruben had his .22 cal. revolver  but no one would move to see what was out there. They were just waiting for whatever it was to attack their tent. The moon had risen  and they could see the shadows of swaying tree branches through the nylon of the tent. The gun was pointed in the direction of the sounds. Ruben swore that whatever it was out there was going to cast it  s shadow down on them with its hairy arms out-stretched  swoop down and yank them out of the tent  tearing everything into shreds! Ruben knew what all the usual forest animals sounded like.  He had been a Boy Scout and a hunter and fisherman for years. He had seen and heard bobcat and cougar and even chased an angry bear  but he had never experienced anything like this before. He just knew that it was heavy and loud and was walking around on two feet!  The crunching and crashing sound was moving along the ridge now  just grunting as it slowly walked away  without screaming anymore. Then it seemed to cross over to the other side of the ridge  very slowly with an occasional fading gorilla-like grunt. The camp was quiet again. The rest of the night the three men took turns staying up  holding the gun and keeping watch inside the tent while the other two tried to sleep. When the sky was just beginning to show signs of daylight  the three grabbed all their gear  threw it into the Jeep and left without breakfast. They didn  t see any animal tracks around their camp... and definitely didn  t want to go towards the ridge to look for any  either. They were in too much of a hurry to get out of there. They didn  t talk about it much on the way home  and they didn  t tell anyone why they were home so early that morning. It  s been over twenty-six years since it happened  and one of the two guys will not talk about it. He claims that Ruben is crazy and made up the whole story. Ruben says that guy doesn  t want to talk about it because he does not want the story getting out that he panicked and was hysterically crying. The other guy still calls Ruben every other Christmas to wish him a good holiday and always ends his conversation with â€œRuben  do you think that the thing we heard when we went camping was a Bigfoot?â€ Ruben always replies  â€œI don  t know  we never saw it. It could have been.â€ But in my husband  s mind and heart he knows it was. ,Take Highway 120 to Evergreen Road to Carlon Station  now a day-use area. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Winter ,6109,no
421,A witness reported that at around 1 00 a.m.  approximately two minutes of extremely loud screaming was heard. The scream appeared to less than 50 meters from the recreational cabins. The scream was loud and high pitched. The cabin was located in the southeast portion of the lake  with no other cabins behind it. ,Take Highway 108 to Strawberry  California.

422,After midnight  I heard more than a minute (possibly 2)  a horrible  extremely loud screaming  unlike anything I  ve heard before or since. I was in a cabin getting ready for bed  but wide awake. The scream was very loud and seemed to be less than 30 meters from where I was. The sound was not a cat screaming  was not human  not bear. As I was hearing it  I ran through my mind the different animals  what it could possibly be. But it was a large animal  the volume was so loud. And a high-pitched screaming. I joke with people to whom I tell the story that it sounded like wildcats being fed through a meat grinder  but that only captures the high-pitched loudness and intensity  but it was NOT a cat. I didn  t know what to think of it. I had heard of Bigfoot  but didn  t know that they had been heard screaming. But 6 months later  I read an account that referred to this horrible screaming  and I knew that was what I had heard. I went to the store at Pinecrest the next day and asked the clerk if she had heard anything  and remember being astonished that she hadn  t heard anything because it was so extremely loud. ,Pinecrest  Sonora Pass  Tuolumne County  California. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Winter ,6109,no
423,I  m writing this with some hesitation as I  m still not sure what  if anything  I saw but  having read varying reports of similar occurences in the area I  m about to describe  I thought you might be interested.  I hesitate because for many years now I  ve attributed what I saw to an often-active imagination and  trick  of light. Let me explain.  When I was approx. 11 or 12 years old (1978 or   79)I was walking through the woods with my younger brother and friend behind the California Dept of Fish and Game patrol cabin across from the Boulder Flats camp ground  Hwy 108 in Tuolumne County about 50 miles or so east of Sonora.  My father is a retired DFG patrol captain and we  d vacation there several times a year.  All we were doing was walking through the woods several hundred yards from the cabin when we saw what looked like a conical-shaped head  brown in color with deep set eyes peering at us from behind a tree approx.100-120 feet away slightly uphill from where we were standing. That  s all.  I still remember that I stood there telling myself that it must be a tree branch stump glinting in the afternoon sun (it was a bright day as I remember).  It didn  t move and we stood looking at it for what must have been at least a minute. My brother then became upset and we ran from the area as fast as we could.  I still don  t know what I saw and you probably won  t find this very interesting but  having read similar accounts of purported sasquatch remaining motinless while observing/ being observed  I have to wonder. ,See above.

424,Around the age of 12 or 13 (I  m 34 now) I went with my parents to Sugerpine Campground in the Sonora/Twain Harte area in California.  We were there for two weeks in our 21   travel trailer  and I was completely bored out of my mind!  I also had just started menstruating for the first time while we were in the middle of our trip  (mentioning this seems weird  but will make sense later). At the campground I met a little girl  a few years younger.  She had been living there with her parents who were without a home.  She showed me a trail that went way out into the woods where there was a small stream (only a few feet wide) with a big rock.  If you climbed up on top of the big rock  there was a tree branch that you could grab onto and swing over the stream.  We played there for a good while and returned to the campground when it started getting dark.  The next day I looked for my friend  but she had apparently moved on with her family - her campsite was empty.  I figured I  d go back out to the stream and play for awhile since I had nothing better to do.  The stream and rock area was a little further than a city block out into the dense forest.  The whole trail was shaded since the pines were so thick.  I merrily went out into the woods  with absolutely no hesitation  looking forward to some fun.  When I got within about 5   to 6   from the big rock I had the strange feeling someone was watching me. The hair on the back of my neck stood up a bit. I still was not afraid and began looking around me (thinking maybe my friend was out there playing somewhere close by and hadn  t left as I had thought).  I looked in front of me and slowly turned counter-clockwise peering into the dense woods.  I continued turning until I was looking directly down the small footpath I just walked to the rock.  As I looked at the pathway  I noticed a very large pine tree that was edging the path had a funny looking  arm thing  wrapped around it  s middle.  I looked - still not afraid - and was trying to figure out what the heck it was; I could make out long fingers and very dark furry brown hair covering the entire  arm .  I thought to myself  that  s not a branch  and it  s not a bear  s paw  it sure looks like a HAND!   Now  this tree was approximately 15   from where I was standing  and DIRECTLY next to the pathway I had just come from.  As I continued to look at the  arm  - still not afraid since in my own mind I kept thinking it couldn  t POSSIBLY be an arm even though it sure looked exactly like one...I saw a face peek out from the opposite side of the tree and look at me.  It was a very flat face  very dark brown - couldn  t make out any features except the eyes  which were looking right at me!  Let me tell you  I was never very athletic  but as soon as we made eye contact I don  t think my feet touched the ground!  Worse yet  I had to run right BY IT to get the heck outta there!  I FLEW back to camp and ran into the trailer.  I didn  t tell my mom or dad about it since I thought they  d think I was crazy.  Needless to say  I stayed in that trailer for the rest of our vacation at Sugarpine. When I mention I started my period for the first time  I believe animals have an uncanny ability to sense and smell those types of things  maybe it caught wind of me and decided to follow and check me out.  The creature was hunched over a bit  so it  s hard to tell exactly how tall it was  or if it was a juvenile.  I do know that the pine tree it had it  s arm wrapped around was around 4   wide in circumference - which makes it a pretty long arm!  Another thing to mention is that I don  t remember smelling anything. ,The campground has grown quite a bit since 1978-79.  I went back to check out the area a few months ago and was surprised to see how much it had changed.  It is now more like a mobile home park towards the back where we had camped.  The homes are very close together and I could not see a way without trespassing to get back to the area where I had entered the forest. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Summer ,6109,yes
425,My son and I arrived at the horse corral near Groundhog Meadow late on a Friday night in early September 1978.  We spent all Saturday building two deer blinds with the intent on coming back to the area to hunt later that year.  The area  at that time  didn  t receive very much recreational activity  and we saw no one else while we were camping. Saturday night  three strange incidences occurred.  First  early in the evening  my son and I heard two screams.  The first scream was located near the horse corral.  The scream sounded like it was from something very large.  It was very loud and low-pitched  sort of like a very large angry man.  I have heard mountain lions in the past  since I have hunted all my life  and this was nothing like that.  A few minutes later  we heard another scream  just like the first  but it came from the east  like from the Emigrant Wilderness.  We both acknowledged that we had heard the screams  but neither of us knew what it was.  My son checked the horse corral and didn  t see anything. Later that evening  as we were sitting around the campfire  I noticed a pair of red eyes looking at me from near the horse corral.  The area where the eyes were was in total darkness and I do not know if the firelight could reach that far in order to cause the eyes to reflect red.  At first  I just thought it was a deer or other animal  but then it dawned on me that the eyes were at least six to seven feet off the ground.  Since I knew the area very well  I knew that there were no trees or other objects in that area for something  like an owl  to stand on.  After it watched me for about 30 minutes  I asked my son if he also saw it.  He did.  He and I continued to be watched for another 30 minutes (one hour total).  After I briefly looked away and I turned back  the eyes were gone.  The next morning  both my son and I checked the area and confirmed that no trees or other objects were present for an animal to stand on and appear to be seven feet tall. The last incident happened the same night when we went to my camper to eat dinner and go to bed.  The camper was on the bed of my utility truck  and was at least five feet off the ground.  As we were making sandwiches  we both heard and felt a loud bang or thud on the side of the camper (on the front driver  s side of the camper).  The camper was hit so hard  it shook the whole truck.  We grabbed our flashlights and immediately went outside  expecting to see either a tree limb or a very dazed deer.  We saw nothing.  We even circled the camper and didn  t see anything.  We both then realized that whatever had hit the camper had to be at least five feet tall and could not have been a deer running blindly in the dark.  We thought that all the incidences were strange  but nothing else happened that night and we went home the next day.  We returned to the area to hunt later on that year. ,We were camped at the horse corral near Groundhog Meadow near Herring Creek Reservoir. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Fall ,6109,no
426,On or about oct.25th 1983  a friend and myself went to look at a three wheeled motorcycle from an ad above Sonora  CA. We arrived in late afternoon  met the lady that wanted to sell it. We entered a fenced area w/a large gate. The area was about thirty feet across [hard packed red clay]  w/ an old shed to the right against some manzanita brush. To the right was a trail through the brush leading to a cabin [unoccupied for years] and unfinished. It was built against the side off a hill where you could walk into it from the trail but when you looked out the window off the main room it was about a forty-foot drop [it was partially on stilts] to the ground. I am an outdoors person  hunter  fishing  hiking  etc.  but I didnâ€™t feel good about this place. We had trouble starting the trike and I recommended leaving it  but my friend wanted it badly and the lady persuaded him to stay the night in the cabin and she would rent a trailer the next day. We went to Sonora for dinner and came back about 8 00 pm. We pulled into the gate [the lady lived about an eighth of a mile up the mountain in a mobile home]. As we exited the 1951 GMC P.U. and walked towards the trail  the brush to the right of it parted and out stepped this huge figure  like a man but taller [we are both 6 feet tall] and wider. It was a dark night but it was darker than the brush and silhouetted very well. It was about ten to twelve feet away and looked right at us. My friend jumped into the truck and I pulled my bowie knife out and swept it back and forth as I backed onto the hood of the truck w/out turning away from it. It casually turned to its left and started across the clearing towards the shed. As it moved it partially turned its head/torso towards me and made a  huff  noise  arms swinging as it crossed the thirty feet in about four strides  turning away from us. We spent a sleepless night in the cabin  as the door didnâ€™t have a knob or lock. ,Specific location available to BFRO researchers. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Spring ,6109,yes
427,No  this was not a visual sighting  I only heard this....  It happened a few years ago  when I was camping in a remote area around Yosemite National Park.  It was very late  my friends had already went to thier tents to sleep.  They were Dome-type tents  and mine was about 40 or 50 yards away from the others. Anyway  I had just turned off my radio (with headphones)  and was drifting off to sleep  when I heard these heavy-sounding footsteps moving around my tent.  Talk about being petrified  because I sure was!!  I have lived around farm animals for most of my life and I know about what size this creature was  by just the sound.  It was bigger than a bear; besides bears can  t walk on thier rear-legs for that long. ,Just somewhere northwest of Groveland  California ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Summer ,6109,no
428,I was listening to Art Bell last night and they where talking about bigfoot....Art played a couple of clips of bigfoot sounds taken I think in Oregon or Washington. When he played the sounds I was driving in my truck (I am a truck driver) and had to pull off the road. The sounds brought back a memory I had tried to forget. I was a teenager at the time.  My parents  Aunt  Uncle  brother and I where up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California on a deer hunting camping trip. We were well away from civilization and the only other people near us was another small group of campers on the other side of the small valley we where in.  My family had camped in this particular spot for years and have never up to that point had anything strange happen. The second night we were all in our respective tents  when out of nowhere there came a sound unlike any we have ever heard in the woods.  To reflect on it now  and before I had heard the sounds that Art Bell played  I would have described it as being somewhere between a woman screaming and a mountain lion  s loud roar.

429,The following is an account of the events of the day while conducting surveys for amphibians downstream of Bloomer Lake. The account may be somewhat fragmented in presentation  as I want to provide a narrative that portrays the events of the day. Additionally  I prefer to provide a narrative and let people draw there own conclusions. First  I recall finding the remains of a fawn in the meadow I wa surveying. Nothing unusual about that  in-and-of-itself...ties-in later. As I continued to conduct my survey  perhaps thirty minutes or so afterwards  I noticed movement off to my right. What I saw was what appeared to be an animal covered with black  semi-long hair (two to three inches  to guess)  walking upright (fully) with a gape somewhat like the current hominids; and approximately five to six feet in height and weighing one hundred seventy-five to two hundred twenty-five pounds.  I saw something move for two or three steps.  It did not appear to go anywhere (but just moved) but of sight.  It did not look at me or react to my viewing  it just simply appeared and then was gone. To some extent I was not really paying attention to my surroundings  as I was focused on my work; but was enjoying the surroundings in that field sort of way.  I recall thinking that that looked like an upright creature walking through the woods.  I tried to repeat my last movements  to see if what I saw was a play on light and shadows.  I was not able to re-create any likeness of what I had seen - the light and shadow of the forest did not seem to be the source of my observation. I did not hear anything.  Either before  during  or after  in regards to the sounds that one might hear if someone were walking in the woods stepping on branches or simply rustling the ground.  I did not take an active interest or pursuit  as I was uncertain of what I think I really saw;  I am skeptical by constitution; not only for mythologies  but in general. Although I did play the event in my mind while I finished my survey.  And occasionally looked in the general vicinity of the area of where I saw the animal-creature-mythological being.  I finished my survey and left the area. While I was returning upstream  approximately one hundred meters from the meadow  I came across an exhausted buck - two or three year old lying on the ground near the creek.  I was able to approach and touch the deer.  I clearly recall brushing flies off his head and sitting next to him for a couple of minutes and thinking this is pretty cool! I was courious about the deer and did think about what I had seen in the meadow. I then proceeded upstream again.  Approximately one hundred fifty meters from the buck I came across a mass of tissue  which looked to me like an aborted fetus.  Upon further investigation  I discovered that it was the entrails of an animal.  Very fresh.  I then looked behind me a saw a freshly killed doe.  Her eyes were still clear and there were no flies or maggots on or in the carcass.  As I examined the doe I could find no sign of struggle. I was unable to locate any apparent method of kill by another animal; thinking of a cougar  which usually will bite at the base of the skull or that general area.  I found no such evidence. The carcass was left fully in the open.  What I did notice was that the right leg had been cleanly ripped off from the main body to include a couple of ribs. There was no blood anywhere.  I looked around as my in-the-woods instincts were quite active. There was that six sense of a presence.  I spent awhile running all of the pieces through my head and thought that this was pretty cool and funky.  I then continued to hike out to Bloomer Lake  taking the experience with me.  ,Upstream from Bloomer Lake. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Summer ,6109,yes
430,While walking on a road headed toward Bert Reed  s historic cabin on the Stanislaus National Forest  the forest suddenly went silent  and then something in the brush screamed at me and the person I was with.  We were unable to see what had made the sound.  We felt like something was watching us  and we both had a terrible fear (but we had both come across bears and other animals in the forest  and never felt this type of fear before).  The fear made us unable to move or speak. After several minutes  the regular forest noises started again  and since we felt better (like we weren  t going to die)  we were able to move away from the location.  We continued on to where we were headed  and on the way back  we went by the same location  but nothing was there. , ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Winter ,6109,no
431,We were camping in tents with our horses tied on a rope between the trees. In the middle of the night I was awakened by a terrifying scream kind of like a woman screaming and then I heard what sounded like my horses were loose and running up the hill. I ran out of my tent to where the horses were and shined my flashlight. All my horses were tyed up and staring up at the top of the hill very upset. We didn  t hear or see anything else so we went to bed. The next morning there were footprints going up the hill like whatever it was had two large feet with a big toe. The next evening at dust we tyed our horses up in the meadow. Our camp was about 300 yards away when we heard a loud sound like the horses startled something  we looked up to see some huge thing running extremely fast across the meadow away from the horses in a cloud of dust. We ran over there and one horse was so scared it had jumped over another horse while they were tied up. So we tyed the horses up in the orginal spot and never heard another thing on the trip. We stayed a week and we felt very stange like something was watching us. There were no animals in the area no birds  squirrels etc etc. We were in the middle of nowhere and we would hike around our camp and there would be stacked rocks little bunches all around the area and the next day they would gone. This went on through out the week and one day we smelt this odor that was so bad around our tent when we came back from a ride but we never saw anything else. This went on for two years that we returned to the exact camping spot. Then one year we were camping and we didn  t feel that same strange feeling we had that someone was watching us  there were birds squirrels insects all kinds of signs of life. That last day a bear came into our campsite and the horses didn  t seem to care. So we were convinced that it could nt have been a bear the first couple of encounters. Not with the sound it made and the way it ran. ,In the area north of Crabtree trailhead above bell meadow. Outside of Sonora Ca. about 30 minute drive. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Summer ,6109,no
432,My friends picked me up from work and asked me to go camping with them. We drove all the way up to the top of the Sonora pass about a mile or so past the Kennedy Meadows area we pulled off the road toward the left. We drove down about 200 yards into a flat area between two mountains and set up camp. We got there about 6 30pm. We were there for about an hour and a half. To be more specific of the time  it was just beginning to get dark or dusky. We had already scouted out the area and had just returned to the camp when all five of us heard a very loud crashing noise. At first I thought it was a tree falling but then I immediately saw a fast moving object running down the ravine which was about fifty yards away from our camp. I then thought it must be a deer but then is when I saw it at it  s closest position to me running in an upright position across the large granite rocks that lay in the ravine. My judgment  was very clear at the time of the sighting and so what I think it was is a very intelligent creature with tremendous speed and strength running like a man and covered in dark hair from head to toe. Lying across ways of the ravine were many fallen trees and so this creature was breaking the branches of these trees while running as fast as a deer would be seen running. Which means it was inhumanly fast but very humanly in character. , ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Summer ,6109,yes
433,My girlfriend and I were finishing a week long backpack trip south of Sonora pass and we spent our last night on a ridge line seperating two deep canyons.  To the east was Kennedy canyon which we had hiked up that day  to the west was another canyon of which I don  t know the given name  only that it was very deep and rugged. I was a bit concerned about our campsite due to the lack of decent trees to hang our food in (this was before bear cannisters  and packers still hung their food in trees to keep it away from bears)  they were all very small due to our elevation.  I awoke about 1 a.m. to the sound of rockfall off one of the peaks above us and I sat awake because I thought it was possibly the sound of a bear coming up the nearby creekbed. Quite suddenly the sound of what I assumed was a large gust of wind came barrelling up the western canyon.  This immedietly struck me as odd as the night was very still.  The sound started as a low moan  growing in strength and intensity and eventually raised in pitch until it resembled a scream bouncing off the mountain walls.  This episode lasted approx. a minute.  As best as I can put the sound into print it went something like this  WHOOOOOOOORROOOOUUUUUIIIIIIEEEEEEEE. I have spent a good part of my life knocking about the wilderness and many years as an alpine mountaineer.  Now I have sat through many a lonley night on a mountain ledge waiting for first light with nothing to do but listen to the wind howl  around the peaks and I  ve heard it do some pretty strange stuff  but when I heard this noise I was dumbfounded.  Now I was wide awake and all was still again.  No wind whatsoever.  After several minutes the sound began again  building up the canyon until it reached the same screaming crescendo.  I thought  whoa  that was bizarre . Satisfied that our food stash wasn  t being raided by a bear I tried to go back to sleep when a very similar moan/howl/scream came up from Kennedy canyon to the east.  The sound was similar in tone and building pitch but seemed fainter  possibly originating from a more distant point.  This is when my girlfriend awoke and I asked her what she thought of the sound  but she wasn  t much of a wilderness person and I didn  t want to scare her so I didn  t push it. ,lat. 38 14   34  long. 119 36   49  intersection of Kennedy canyon trail and what I call  Leavitt lake trail .

434,My husband and I were hunting in Sonora. Our location was Eagle Meadows which is above Strawberry  California off of California Highway 108. It was a sunny  cold day.  We dressed in our camoflauge and began our hunt.  We were deep in the woods had climbed down a hillside of boulders and into what looked like a perfect hunting area.  Forest on either side of a meadow approximately 300 yards wide. We found pine trees to sit under (they had low branches) to await our perfect buck and so put on our skunk scent. My husband was approximately 10 feet away from me.  We each had views across the meadow.  But I could not share his nor could he share my view for there was a clump of trees and bushes about 100 yards in front of us and positioned between the trees we were under.   About 20 minutes into the hunt we heard branches breaking across the meadow.  My husband quietly told me to be aware of bears.  To stay alert.  It was approximately 10 30/11 00 a.m. when I looked back across the meadow and saw something that wasn  t there 3 to 5 minutes ago.  Immediately  I thought  Could it be a Bear?   I rationalized if it was only shadows from trees  a dead log with light coming through?  But none of my theories fit. The image I saw was black.  The sun was shining from behind it so the front looked black.  Then I thought  It must be a Sasquatch.   I saw most of his head  3/4  s of his chest area and down to what could possibly be the waist.  The rest was hidden by the trees/bushes.  After totally analyzing the figure  the blackness  I thought if it is a bigboot it must have eyes.  I brought my small camouflage binoculars up to my eyes slowly and looked across this meadow.  It was then that fear and anxiousness prevailed.  For I saw two yellow eyes watching me very intently.  I have never been so scared.  I was afraid to move an inch.  I continued observing for about 15 minutes and he stood there and watched me too.  We were both very still.  I was wondering if he would move  why he was so intent on observing me?  Then my instinct told me to move and get out of there.  I motioned to my husband that I was going back to camp but did not tell him why.  My fear didn  t allow me to speak.  My intent was to leave the area as quickly as possible. I high-tailed it back to camp.  Up the stoney hillside and through the woods all the time looking over my shoulder.  Later when my husband came in I asked him if he saw anything unusual?  He said he didn  t.  So the Bigfoot didn  t walk across the meadow or my husband would have seen him.   The Sasquatch found me.  I was there under that tree first  minutes before he came into the area.  I honestly believe without a doubt that this was a Sasquatch.  I do not believe that it was a dangerous threat to me or it would have advanced towards me.  I do not believe it was a bear because a bear would not have stood still for so long.  I wonder if these creatures are just as about us as we are of them.  If only I could go back to that point in time.  I would have slowly moved across the meadow towards it  to see what it would have done and to investigate farther.   My husband said   What would you have done if it charged you?   I said   Run and scream.   My point is  how will anyone ever know the truth if they don  t cautiously and tamely approach one.  Would love the opportunity to go on a real sighting and/or search.  The opportunity to see a Sasqatch in motion would be awesome. ,We were located in Eagle Meadows.

435,I had spoken to an apparent field biologist in the area and he (whose name I do not remeber) who did not seem too interested. This pleased me because I felt that if there was a trail of denial maybe the creatures existence would be kept safe. The incident goes as follows  Late at night while travelling with my wife in the passenger seat in the front and my 2 kids sleeping in the back we passed by the upper river camp site where I had stayed about 10 years earlier. We had been on the road sometime and were still responsive but tired. As we passed a tight hairpin turn we had not said anything for hours because of the monotonous trip. When we viewed the creature in our headlights  she stated Did you see that ? In her mid-sentance I stated What was that . I notice extreme detail because as a nurse I have had 5 courses in human anatomy and am in Pharmacy school at UCSF. I  ve had physiology and numerous science courses. I am the first to admit I am no expert but here is the description. My wife noticed the eyes as reflextive  I did not. I noted the eyes of the creature as black melting into the darkness of it  s face. The creature was standing on a rock  balancing very well as if to have a bend in the middle of it  s foot. The rock it stood on tapered to an almost 90 degree angle. When I first saw the creature it was bent over directly facing us. As we came around the corner it very very slowly and methodically pivotted in an upright standing motion as its head looked directly up at us. I will never forget it. It had a black coat with a silvery gray. It appearred  old  and my wife afterward felt similar. The chest and torso were almost cylindrical. The arms extended far  alittle below the pelvis and looked long and cylindrical and thin. The most amazing thing about this creature was the stealthy survivalist mode. It mimiced the actions of nature. What I mean to say is instead of for instance a human seeing an oncoming car and displaying a startled response by moving irratically and uncontrolled. The creature was very deliberate  meticulous in it  s actions moving no more than the branches around it trying not to attract attention. It went from a bent over position to standing upright.  ,Approx. 2-5 miles after the upper river campsite at the first sharp 90 degree turn. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Summer ,6109,yes
436,During the last week of August  1999  myself and a friend left the Kennedy trailhead about an hour before dark.  After about 1.5-2 hours of hiking  we decided to camp.  We had just crossed the first major bridge over the Kennedy Soda Can Creek  and we doubled back a ways to a flat spot to camp for the night.  We were about 15 yards from the creek itself.  Around midnight to 1 00 a.m.  I was drifting off to sleep when I heard a large  heavy  two-legged creature walking across the creek.  Since the creek was deep  I could clearly hear it splashing.  It would walk a little while  stop  then continue.  This went on for about a minute.  Although we did see another camper about 200-300 feet away  I can  t imagine why someone would be walking across the creek at that time of night. ,This occurred in the Emigrant Wilderness  just outside of Kennedy Meadow.

437,This report details a two-year investigation of bigfoot activity in the Twain Harte area by BFRO investigators Kathy Moskowitz and Montra DuMond.  Only highlights are listed here  but monitoring occurred daily. March  2001   screams heard; the locations of the screams are pinpointed by four broken trees. April  2001   blasting of Lake Tahoe and Ohio scream begins.  Seven additional broken trees appear  one each the morning after blasting occurred  and in the same location where the blast originated. late April-early May  2001   baiting begins at the PG&E Columbia ditch.  Baiting material is apples.  Bait is taken within a day.  New bait is placed every other day. May 12  2001   new broken trees  dozens of fresh footprints  and two nests are found.  An obvious trail crosses the road in the same location  so the area is staked out.  Although no bigfoot is seen  something very large and walking on two feet approaches the stakeout location.  A sudden oncoming car scares whatever it was downhill and a large  two legged creatures is heard crashing through the brush. May 13  2001   all the broken trees  two nests  and dozens of footprints (14 inches  5.5 foot stride  trees broken at the 6 to 6.5 foot level) are documented.  One nest was  incomplete  and obviously not used recently  but the other was very unique.  As an archaeologist  it was obvious that only hands could have constructed the shelter (the branches were interwoven).  The body imprint (matted down veg)  was 7 feet long.  This location is about 1/2 mile from the other location with the 10 broken trees  and where he had been taking the bait (and always leaving just one apple).  This week  no fruit was taken (PG&E is clearing trees along the powerline  disturbing the area). May 18  2001   nests investigated.  The nest floor was excavated and screened; construction photographed  and the nests taken apart to determine construction method.  A detailed report  with photos  is at http //www.bfro.net/ref/fieldres/sasquatchnest.asp May 29-31  2001   intensive field investigation  more prints found.  Local resident reports screams from Big Hill area. June 23-31  2001   intensive field investigations  more prints and broken trees found.  CDs (to try to recover finger prints) placed in nests and general area. July  August  Sept. 2001 - no new information or activity.  Hot weather may have driven the bigfoot uphill. October  2001 to Feb. 2002 - checked the area about once a week (when the roads are snow free).  Checked the nest area for new activity  nothing.  Checked CDs hung all over the location  all are still in place and no fingerprints noted.  Tried blasting  but nothing responded. March  2002 - continue to check the Big Hill and Ditch areas.  No new trees  nests  prints  or other activity noted.  Baiting location reestablished with apples  peanut butter  and various vegs.  After three weeks  no bait taken.  Snow has been very heavy  unlike last year when March was warm (Spring weather).  Usual vegetation is not yet blooming.  Local deer herd appear to be in need of food  as they are eating non-native shrubs  which they haven  t eaten before.  Next few weeks are supposed to be warmer. March 2002 to current - PG&E cleared the area of trees to prevent fires.  No new activity has been noted since that time.  It is likely that whatever was in there is now gone. ,Location   a two mile radius around the Regional Learning Center on Big Hill Road and 2N01. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Spring ,6109,no
438,The witness went snowshoeing Sunday morning  April 22  2001 on the road past Long Barn that runs down to the Clavey. There was snowfall the previous Fri night/Sat. morning and there was six to eight inches of fresh snow on the ground.  The road was closed at the first gate  so he parked the car there and hiked in on the road aprox. 1 to 1 1/2 miles. All told  approx 2 miles from the highway.  He spotted a small animal trail and was kind of watching the path when he came upon six prints going across the road.  He had a camera and took pictures. He used a adjustable ski pole as a measuring unit and has those measurments. It was hot and sunny that day with temps over 65. The sides of the road were heavily forested and went down a steep incline (no snow). He did not go off the road to follow. He hiked for another hour or so and when he came back the prints were melting rapidly. Approximate sizes were 3  deep  17  long with a 5 foot stride between each print. Width 7 1/3 inches at widest  heel was 4 inches.  The prints seemed to go in a straight line  not staggered like humans. No other footprints human or otherwise around. ,Take Highway 108 to Long Barn  and take the Long Barn road toward Fahey Cabin. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Spring ,6109,no
439,May 15th  2001 My wife and I recently relocated to Sonora from San Jose Ca. I live in the vicinity of Nile River Drive. My back yard is open to the forest before you get to Comstock Ranch. Well my wife and I were just finishing up dinner. The sun had just set and I decided to let my 2 small dogs off the deck and let them run around outside. About 10 minutes while I was at the back of the house  I heard this indescribable scream. I told my wife to let the dogs in as I could hear through an open window the rustling around  one of my dogs was barking...I ran to open the sliding glass door...only one dog made it back in. The other one never came home. I contacted DFG and notified them of the screams that I heard. I still hear them every once in a while coming from the back of my home that leads to the forest. I do not let my dogs outside at night any longer. ,My home is located on Nile River Drive  Upper Crystal Falls.

440,We were staying at Sand Bar Flat campground  when my mother and I heard a scream that lasted for two hours  not far from our tent.  It started at about 2 00 a.m. and ended around 4 00 a.m.  There were probably two individuals  as we heard return calls down the river from where we were.

441,I noticed a report on your website from September of 2001 at the Sand Flat campground (State of California  County of Tuolumne). The hair stood up on my neck when I read this due to the similarities with my experience. My experience occurred the same month and year at the Clark Fork campground  about one mile Southwest of Sand Flat. My wife and I arrived at the Clark Fork campground on Thursday  September 20th 2001. This was our first ever September camping trip (we usually go in mid-August). We were surprised at how few people were in the campground compared to our 4 previous trips to this area. One factor that probably lead to the extremely low occupancy was that the 9/11 terrorist attacks had happened the week before. Out of 88 camp sites  probably only twelve were occupied. We set up our camp in the â€œB loopâ€ and settled in. The B loop is our favorite of the 2 campground loops. It has a slightly nicer setting (more pine trees  nicer bathrooms  etc.) and is closer to the â€œwildernessâ€ than the A loop. But on Sunday the 23rd  the two retiree campground hosts told us the B loop was closing for the season and that we would need to move to the A loop of we were going to stay. After relocating to the A loop on Sunday morning we noticed that there was only two other campsites occupied. All other campers had left. One group was a young couple with two very young children  the other was two older men in their 60â€™s or 70â€™s with a trailer. I had never seen so few people in this area. It was really nice to practically have the whole place to ourselves. It was very quiet. Sunday night it rained hard  and we spent most of Monday morning patching our leaky tent and drying everything out. On Monday night  we did as we always did before bed  played cards and listened to the radio. We climbed into our tent and went to bed at about 10 00 p.m. Late that night after 2 a.m.  I slowly came out of a deep sleep due to high-pitch noise which I initially thought was a wounded coyote. After I was fully awake  the noise got much louder. It was clearly a â€œscreamingâ€ sound rather than howling  yipping  yelling  or shouting. The screaming appeared to be coming from the Clark Fork River area  north of the access road which leads to the campground. The sound got progressively louder and was obviously not from a canine. I wondered if any human being could make a sound so loud  long  and hideous. The sound changed pitch and tempo many times. My wife woke up about a minute into the screaming. She asked  â€œWhy is that man screaming?â€ I had no idea what could have made such a sound but it was very unsettling. My wife said it sounded like a man was being murdered out in the forest  but then commented that a person couldnâ€™t make a sound like that. Whatever made these sounds had to have an enormous lung capacity. The screaming went on for about 5 full minutes before it stopped. I laid awake for a while  nervous and wondering what it could have been. Frankly I didnâ€™t want to know. As I drifted off to sleep about an hour later  I was awakened by a very loud metal-on-metal â€œbangâ€ coming from the closed B loop portion of the campground. It was obvious to me that the sound was one of the bear-proof dumpster lids being lifted up and then dropped. Iâ€™ve heard the sound many times. Now thatâ€™s fine and dandy  except that it was 3 00 a.m.  bears canâ€™t open the dumpster lids  and there was no one else in the area where the sound came from. The B loop was closed. This really bothered me. I did not fall asleep until almost dawn. I laid clutching a pistol with my heart racing every time I heard a rustle outside of our tent. I refused to leave the tent until it was light. I have heard hundreds of coyotes throughout the years  both in the Sierras and in the California desert  and this screaming was not a coyote. As for the possibility of a mountain lion making these sounds  I would bet my life that it wasnâ€™t a feline. Iâ€™ve heard mountain lions make some strange noises  but the bottom line is that a cat sounds like a cat. Itâ€™s easy to distinguish between noises a feline  a canine  or a bear makes. The screaming that my wife and I heard was none of these. ,Popular area off Highway 108 corridor.

442,I took a trip over the fourth of July to visit a friend in Modesto.  We traveled to Tuolumne County  past Sonora  and camped off of Gargoyle trail above Strawberry on the night of July 4th.  We got to the camp site at about 4 00pm and set up.  My two friends took a nap after setting the tent up but I decided to look around  so I took a hike down a dirt road that lead into the forest.  I was hiking around when my friend came to look for me.  We hiked further into the forest and found a big rock formation and climbed up.  The top was about the size of a football field.  On top we found three stacked rocks and took some video of it.  The bottom rock was big  it came up to my shins and the top two were smaller. Maybe five pounds each. We then went off into the unknown on the other side of the rock formation.  We had to hike down a lot of boulders and the brush was getting pretty thick.  It was now probably 7 00 or 7 30 so the sun was disappearing and it was getting dark.  As we got closer to the trees I felt as though we were being watched.  Just my imagination I thought  so we hiked on.  This feeling remained and I started to think about how long it would take to get up the rocks we were clibing down. Besides if something was watching us it could have been a bear.  I convinced my friend to go back to camp and we did. At about 8 30 or 9 00 my friend heard rocks being clinked together of in the distance and he said they were answered off in the opposite direction.  I didn  t believe him but soon I heard the clinking too.  It was fast but obviously not a wood pecker.  My friend commented that the pattern seemed not human  but I thought it could have been. This banging went on for about twenty minutes and then quit.  We went to sleep later and didn  t hear anything all night.  I did notice it was a moonless night and the forest was pitch black.  The next morning we got up and I checked for foot prints around the camp fire were I cleared everything within five feet but saw nothing.  As we were packing up we heard the banging off in the distance again so I decided to try and copy the patterns.  I tried using two rocks and the sound wouldn  t carry.  So I then tried a rock on a log.  Finally I settled on a small branch on the log because it sounded to me like what was coming from the forest.  The banging was repititious with a pattern on the end.  I mimiced the banging for about ten minutes before it stopped answering me.  I started packing up again and we heard it another time so I tried to answer it.  No answer.  It did it again  I answered  no answer.  There were long pauses in between my responces and its banging.  I got the feeling what ever it was  wanted to continue it  s banging but not in response to me.

443,I was traveling with my father and my fathers friends. Now i should tell you that my father was an active hunter  hiker and outdoorsman. My father was also 6  3 and two hundred and fifty pounds. There where exactly 6 of us including my self. We had traveled to the end of forest route 3n83 and had planned to camp in the general area for the night. Later on my father and told me that all this was planned so i could get used to hunting  and camping  this was a surprise for my 13th birthday. he said that we were supposed to spend two days there. We began to travel east of the end of the road. We walked for about 20 minutes through moderatley dense underbrush and reached a clearing where my dad decided to teach me how to make a fire. After around two hours i finally succeeded in making a fire. At around 4 30pm I finally made a fire. At this time my father decided to camp here  his friends agreed and set about setting up camp. Now as they set up they talked about there other hunting experiances  me being young and stupid i decided to re-enact some of the stories. I decided to walk in a general east direction playing with a stick pretending it was a rifle. I eventually got to a smaller clearing and saw a squirell or some other small mammal and decided to chase it. It ran across the clearing and up the nearest tree. I threw two rocks at it and then became bored. So i continued in the direction i was headed. I came to an area where the tress thinned and i could see a meadow. At this time it had just begun to get dark. I turned around to go back to the camp when I noticed a terrible odor. It smelled like a very large wallowy pig. I covered my nose and continued walking. I began hearing brush breaking about 50 -100 feet behind me. At this time i noticed that me father and his friends had begun to look for me and I could hear them calling. As soon as i could hear the voices the brush breaking stopped so i ran back to the camp. When i got back to where they were they had already started to pass around beef jerky and water. I sat next to my father and awaited the food. That night i was in a tent with my father who was sound asleep  when i thought i heard some brush breaking. We had divided our group into three tents  two in each. I sat there very still not sure what to do but i felt that something was wrong. I quietly woke up my dad to tell him about the sound. He woke up and I motioned him to be quiet and he heard the brush breaking around the edge of our camp. He grabbed his hand gun  and yelled whos there? The brush breaking stopped and then the area got quiet. My dad cocked the safety back and yelled again. This time there was a kind of crashing noise like a branch snapping  and then it got quiet. My dad crept form the tent and checked on the others  they were woken up by my dads yelling and had heard the crash. They lit a fire and remained awake the rest of the night. The food we had hung 6 feet to 7 1/2 feet of the ground was gone. The branch it was on had broken about a foot  s length from the trunk of the tree  the branch there was at least 4 to 6 inches in diameter.  There was also the faint wallowy odor in the forest around the clearing. We packed our stuff up and left the woods. My father and i have since moved from california and my father has never spoken of the event again. , ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Fall ,6109,no
444,Christmas Eve 2003  my wife and I spent XMas in Twain Harte  CA with friends.  This area is deep in the Sierra Mountains and has plenty of snow during the winter months. We stayed at our friendsâ€™ cabin  which sleeps twelve people with no problem. The cabin is about six to eight feet off the ground and the only way in is by using wooden stairs to climb into it. There was plenty of snow and we were warned about walking on the porch. To get to the porch we had to go through the house.  The cabin was warm with the great wooden heater even though the windows had no coverings. Christmas Eve was upon us and the traditional events came and went.  After midnight  everyone eventually went to bed and retired for the night.  I was sleeping in a room by the porch and the windows like I said before  had no curtains or shades. I could see very little from all the windows except for one  which was near the outside porch light.  I could see a small portion of the porch from that window.  I went to sleep as did everyone else  but was awakened several hours later.  There was a slight movement all around the cabin like a small earthquake.  I turned over thinking just that. Moments later  I felt movement again but this time it felt like someone was walking on the porch.  I sat up to look around and did not see anything or anyone. I decided to use the restroom since I was awake and eventually found my way back to bed.  It was then that I noticed something moving by the porch light. At first  I thought it was a man with long brown hair  but then noticed that it had hair on its arms and back. After a better look  it had hair all over its body  but it seemed more of an orange-brown color.  Frightened as can be  I just kept looking at this thing.  It had its back towards me for several minutes and then slowly turned to look in my direction.  I was about twenty feet from the window so I am certain that it did not see me.  It leaned over to see through the window.  I would estimate it to have been about six foot six inches tall.  Its weight was about three hundred pounds and well proportioned.  I compared  compared the beast to a friend who is six foot two inches tall and weights three hundred pounds.  It looked fairly young like a teenage boy. There was also no odor as this thing walked around.  The face was more like a caveman but very sad looking.  I could barely see its eyes in the dark  but I noticed them when it looked left and right. They seemed to be dark brown. The beast was frightening when it turned and looked in towards the window.  Its chest was like that of a male and I am assuming that it was not quite a grownup yet.  It was searching for something but I donâ€™t know what.  I also noticed that our friendâ€™s dogs were no where to be heard or found in the cabin. After a quick scan of the room  it turned and headed towards the porch rail.  Eventually  it jumped from the porch  which was a six to eight foot drop.  In the morning  I did not mention this event to anyone nor did I go looking for evidence. I believe there are different species scattered around the world.  I always believe they existed but my thoughts were reinforced with this citing.  This is also the first time anyone has heard or read this story from me. ,I  ve only been there twice and there are so many streets to turn too that I still have no idea how to get to the cabin.  All I know is how to get to Twain Hearts. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Winter ,6109,yes
445,On 7/3/06 around 4 35pm  I (age 42) took my two sons  ages 7 & 8 to a nearby lake while my husband stayed behind to continue building our cabin. It  s a hard 23 minute  offroad drive of 4.3 miles  so we were very specific about our departure and return times  just in case my husband would need to come looking for us. After unsuccessfully looking for a wading spot near our truck  (mucky water  underwater plants and drop-offs) the boys and I made quite a trek to a prior favorite point that juts out like a partial island  with fishing nets  swimsuits and snacks. The path has become almost non-existent due to fallen trees  branches and almost no foot traffic. This is a very remote lake  not visible from any main forest service road. Our whole trip consisted of 1 1/3 hours at the lake. We were dipping our toes and talking about the fish  when I said we needed to pack it up. I had just heard a noise in the far distance of what sounded like a single  medium tone  whoop or yup  (#1). I told the boys to be quiet for a minute and this time we all heard it (#2). None of us could identify it  so I yelled   Hello?  and waited. It responded again with a single  whoop  (#3) which sounded significantly louder.  The boys caught on to this right away  and said  â€œMom  itâ€™s getting closerâ€.  We thought it might be a hurt backpacker off in the distance  so I yelled   Is anybody out there?  Each response was about 30-60 seconds and this time it was very loud and close (#4). I thought someone was playing a joke on us at first  but realized I could neither see  nor identify the sound. The frightening issue was that no other sound was made as it approached us. I expected sticks and twigs to be snapping  so I wrote it off as some curious bird moving quickly between trees (mostly for the boys sake).  There was a golden mantel chipmunk in the distance that was very upset about something  but everything else was eerily quiet. I felt like we were being watched the whole time  but never said anything because I didn  t want to spook the boys.  I experienced the same  watched  feeling the last time we were at that spot (last year) and remember hearing what I thought was a deer walking around us  but I never saw anything. We packed up fast and bee-lined it to the pickup. I did not want to be stuck on a spit of land with two young kids that are just learning to swim. I could have made it across the lake to the truck  but not the boys. It sounded like a cross between a human and animal that was made by something very large. It was absolutely not a bird (quail/woodpecker)  bear or cougar sound. Last year on two separate occasions  we had a young cougar  then a bear run in front of our pickup and we  re very familiar with their  walking and verbal   sounds. I have been camping all of my life and have never experienced that sound before. I had my digital camera with me and never once thought to put it in Video mode to record the sounds. The whole thing took place over a 5 minute period and we were just focusing on getting back to the pickup. I was born and raised in Port Orchard  WA  so I  m very familiar with Sasquatch and BigFoot tales. I have always felt they could be real  but have never had any encounter with one. I decided to poke around online to see what a Yeti might sound like and read John Bindernagel  s research. My hair stood on end and I called my husband at work who thinks the whole thing is fabulous. I also read about the BFRO expeditions in Northern California and Humboldt County  along with a lot of other information and projects. I decided to respond to you with my information for whatever itâ€™s worth.  I canâ€™t explain it  and both of the boys have very vivid and accurate memories of what we all heard. Thanks for listening and please contact us if you have any questions. ,THE SOUNDS WERE HEARD AT LAKE MORAN.

446,I was tent camping with my wife and daughter along Trout Creek about 1/2 mile west of the Clavey River. I woke up early but just laid in my sleeping bag for while. All of a sudden  I heard the  scream  which continued for 20-30 seconds and then it started again for about the same length of time. I thought I was the only one awake at the time but when I turned my head to look at my wife  her eyes were wide open. She turned her head to look at me and we both had that  yep  that  s what it is  look. She was kind of freaked out about it but I was rather excited as I have been interested in seeing or hearing some kind of bigfoot evidence. The sound came from the northern direction which was upstream from us. It sounded as if it was kind of far and had a slight echo to it. It was very similar to other scream recordings that my wife and I have heard. ,In the Stanislaus National Forest. From Long Barn  Take North Fork rd. east  it will turn in to Forest road 3N01.

447,I was just about to go to bed for the night when I took my dog outside for a quick walk. The area around my house is very densely wooded and my backyard is so forested that it  s hard to see in the dark more than maybe 20 feet in. As I was about to head back inside I heard what sounded like a person walking through the brush about 80 yards out. Because of the time  I was curious as to who was walking in my backyard and decided to stay silent and observe rather than calling out. After a few moments of silence there was continued wrestling in the trees and what sounded like the snapping and breaking of branches. My dog started a low growl and the movement in the trees stopped. A few seconds later  there was a deep  loud growl in the trees. I told my dog to be quiet  but she barked at the noises causing the creature in the trees to start a progressive scream which at its peak was so loud I am sure it was not human. I went back inside immediately  but my dog continued to growl at the noises for quite some time. I didn  t have a view of the yard from my room because of a stairway in the way  but I continued to hear the creature vocalizing over the next ten minutes. I  ve heard the screams of mountain lions before  but never anything like this. ,Near the intersection of Ponderosa Drive and the main road  Twain Harte Drive. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Fall ,6109,no
448,I was up off old strawberry road on sunday afternoon about 4pm. Take left before you get to strawberry proper off 108. I was getting the dogs out of the truck. Its a one lane old road  there was a turn about 300 yards away. I caught something out of the corner of my eye  looked up and saw the top halves of what I took to be two people walking across the street very quickly with their hoods up (I assumed hoods because of the peak on the head). They were almost across the street and at the point in the curve where I could not see them anymore... when I looked up. I figured they would be coming toward me or I would be able to see them going away from me as there is no trail up the hill from where I saw them and they crossed at a turn in the road where I could not see  but could see the road before and after the turn.  Never saw them again. I didn  t worry about it  took the dogs for a walk down to check out the river for opening trout season in a couple days. An hour or so later I got back to the truck after letting the dogs romp around in the stream for a while. I drove down to the turn to take a look. There was a slip mark running about 2 1/2 feet down the muddy slope and what looked like another ball of the foot impression in the embankment as well.  There is no trail going up the hill here...there is a fire / private road directly across from where I saw the 2 figures crossing the road. ,Already posted....left turn on old strawberry road. Pass a water tower on the left a turn or two more down the road. There are some walking sticks (I figure) leaning against a large tree right where I parked (left side of the road)...they were there last week when I was by the area as well so they are probably still there. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Spring ,6109,yes
449,I was camping with my dad at Bear Lake in Emigrant National Wilderness. I had just woken up from a loud strange sound  I put my boots on and got out of the tent and heard a very loud howling noise comign from the top of the cliffs nearby. It was just a really loud howling sound almost like the sound a gorilla makes. But it lasted for about two hours. From 5am when the sun was just coming up til just before i ate breakfast  and that was around 7am. But during the course of this loud howling sound  what ever it had moved.. along the cliffs  I didn  t see anything but I could tell the sound wasn  t coming from where it was originally. The howling was echoing off the canyon walls  and it could be heard throughout the canyon  boy scouts had left very early that morning after they heard the sounds. There were many caves in the cliffs  the top of the cliff was about probably 8 000 ft  I was around 7 400 ft. What ever had been making the sounds I heard that morning eventually stopped and left the area I think  or I just didn  t hear anything after that. ,Going to Pinecrest or Strawberry  then go towards the dodge ski lodge  and take the road that leads you to crab tree trail head and then Bear Lake is the first or second lake in Emigrant National Wilderness(after the sign). ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Summer ,6109,no
450,The town of strawberry is about 10 miles from Beardsley Lake. Myself  my ex  both of her parents  and some friends (who happened to be in another car ahead of us) were on our way up to Beardsley Lake to go camping. It was just after dark and our friends (who are very catholic) had just crossed the bridge saw something cross the road from left to right just ahead of them. We (in our car) were just behind them maybe like a minute and as we got to the other side of the bridge I was facing my ex talking to her and just over her should I saw something about 9 or 10 feet tall walking like it was walking through the brush. It turned and looked right at the car and I got a very good look at it and realized it was a Bigfoot. I wasn  t scared. I instantly got excited and grabbed my camera and start telling my ex  s mother  who was driving  to pull over so I could get pictures. She refused. We continued up the highway following our friends and I watched as they pulled over. I though maybe they missed the road to turn off to go to the lake so we pulled over too. Our friend  s husband rolled down the window leaned out and screamed   What the hell just walked in front of my car?  What I saw was about 9 or 10 feet tall  covered in dark (like black or dark brown) hair  long arms ( longer then a normal mans) its face was like every picture i have ever seen and it walked down towards the river and up into the woods. It walked like it was moving the brush out of its way. And when it looked at the car its eyes were red. I think that was due to the headlights and other few lights around. We then finally got to the lake our friends and myself talked about it and I told them what it was. Nobody else in my car saw it but both people in the other car saw it. The next day we went into strawberry to get a couple of things and found that bigfoots have been seen around there quite a few times. ,Its about a mile from the turnoff for beardsley lake and about 9 miles from the lake itself. ,Tuolumne,36,California ,CA,Summer ,6109,yes
451,Okay  I just spent about ten or fifteen minutes listening to the various sounds and recordings that you have to try to help me identify what we heard. I cannot say that any of the recordings sounded just like what we heard  however it sounded similar to many of them. My family (husband and two kids) went up to Big Prather Meadows  straight up from Dorrington  California. My husband  s grandpa has a small cabin in the meadow  and we go there when we can  generally in the summer. I made the mistake of reading a bunch of your stuff prior to the trip  and I admit that I was on  high alert  that first night. However  around 2 30 or so in the morning of Friday  July 25th  2008 (just three days ago)  I heard some kind of vocalization that was not familiar to me. I was not happy to hear this  honestly. I suppose I ought to be since I have held an avid interest in this subject for years  but there is a whacking big difference between sitting safely in your home reading about this stuff on the net  and listening to something make funky noises in the dark woods of a forest. As my best friend said   I used to really like the cabin...  I got out of the tent to wake up my husband  who was sleeping on the ground by the unused fire pit. We both sat and listened to the sounds for about an hour and a half  or so. To the best of my ability  this is what we heard  Loud  clear  not-shrill sounding (to me  the Puyallup calls sound somewhat metallic and shrill)  medium-range  and smooth sounds. They began lower in pitch and would rise smoothly to end at a higher pitch  but not like the whoops that you have recorded. These didn  t have that  lilt  at the end. It was just a smooth ascent from low range up to a higher range. There was another call that sounded like what a contraction looks like. (Forgive me  I  m not sure how to describe it but it made me think of what my contractions looked like on paper when birthing my kids)  beginning low  smoothly rising up to a higher level  and then smoothly descending down again. There was also a kind of a hiccup sort of sound that would directly follow some of the calls  but I was literally shaking and too freaked out about it to really pay attention to what kind of call it followed  the upswing  or the contraction call. Anyhow  as I said  this went on for over an hour with the two of us listening. Sometimes it would sound like it was moving near to us. Other times it sounded further away. I am not sure if there were two animals  thus accounting for the near/far sounds  or one. If it was two animals  they sounded identical to me. After this happened  we both tried to explain how big/far the sounds were to us. We both agree that it sounded somewhat distant  but find it hard to tell since sound might carry really well in a dead-silent forest. We agree that it sounded to be between a half a mile and a mile away. We also agree that it was a large sound. Whatever made it sounded effortless on its part  but was a very large sound. We believe that it is a sound of  size  similar to  say a very loud moo of a cow across a field. I  m digging here because I  ve never had any experience like it so I don  t have much I can truly compare it to. I grew up in Washington State  west side. I  m a Biology minor with a Life Science teaching credential  so I am familiar  at least  with what wildlife looks like and sounds like in videos  if not in person. But most of my personal encounters with wildlife have been animals of the smaller variety  coyote yips and howls things like that. I  ve only heard larger animals on wildlife programs and I am holding out the hope that one of your specialists will call me back and explain that what we heard was just a  such and such  and often is confused with a Big Foot call. I  d be able to enjoy the cabin a lot more if you could do so. But  I know you won  t  because this was a very strange sound  and even my mathematician-husband  who is grounded in science and wasn  t afraid like I was  stated that it sure was loud  and that it wasn  t like anything he  d ever heard before. It sounded like an animal  but it also sounded enough like a person to think it could have been a joke  but not exactly. I do not think I could replicate the sound. ,Big Preather Meadows  a private preserve and association.

453,An unknown ape-like creature walked upright out of the thick patch of bushes and stood looking  for several seconds  up and down the fire lane.  I cocked the hammer back on the .32 caliber carbine  shouldered the weapon  and began to press the trigger.  Something in my mind ordered me to not shoot the creature!  I call it Devine intervention. I asked myself if this was a bear?  No  I instantly decided that it didnâ€™t look like a bear because there was not a long  protruding snout jutting out from the face.  Besides  bears were not legal game in this area of California.  It certainly was not a buck  never mind the fact that if it was a deer there were no horns on this animal.  I immediately told myself it looked like a â€œmonkey manâ€.  I can hear myself today saying these words out loud   â€œWhat the hell is a monkey doing out here in the mountainsâ€?  In the meantime  as I made the move to shoulder the carbine  and spoke those words  the big animal turned towards me from the waste up.  Looking over the sights of the little carbine  I observed this being to be about 7 or 8 feet tall  with well-muscled  long hairy arms hanging down to the waist. The hands looked almost human; I remember noticing these things as I slowly put down the gun.  This creature was completely covered in long dark  brown hair  from head to feet and appeared to have a huge  barrel chest.  Some other striking features that I noticed were a flat  square jawed face; a flat  dark looking nose; no noticeable hair on the face; and a â€œsloping fore headâ€.  I donâ€™t remember seeing any sign of ears on the animal â€“ too much long hair around the side of the head â€“ and there was no discernable neck.  Since I had no idea what this creature was  Iâ€™ve always been glad to have instantly decided NOT TO SHOOT IT!  Thank God for protective Angles?  The other thing I thought about  at the time  was this could be some idiot in a â€œmonkey suitâ€ playing a prank on some hunter like me.  But  then  only a â€œvillage idiotâ€ would dress up in a monkey costume and roam around the mountains during deer hunting season.  As I contemplate the incident today  I realize now that this was a Bigfoot!  And  it had both seen and heard me.  I could not tell what sex it was because of all the long  dark hair around the body.  However  now that I have seen numerous showings of the Patterson film in which â€œPattieâ€ was documented  I must guesstimate it was male in gender?  Within 10-15 seconds  as quickly as the creature had entered my field of view  it calmly made about two strides across the open fire lane  parted some tall bushes with well-muscled  uplifted hairy arms  and disappeared into the thick bushes. Right away I noticed that it was now standing inside the screen of thick brush along side of the fire land like it was watching me.  I could readily discern the huge dark shape  as it stood there for possibly a minute or so.  Apparently  it was looking at me sitting up the hill on the ground.  I didnâ€™t know at the time whether it was going to attack me or leave.  I kept the little carbine in the â€œready positionâ€ across my chest and slowly stood up to get a better look at this unknown animal. I decided at the moment when I stood up that  that if this thing would â€œchargeâ€ me  I was going to run back up the hill to my dad - unless it got too close to me.  Then  and only then  would I consider shooting the animal!  I admit it â€“ I was scared fit to wet my pants.  I now recall seeing the bushes shake violently and the dark shape stepped out of sight.  I slowly sat down again and listened to its rustling footsteps as the huge â€œape-manâ€ descended down the hill away from me.  Boy was I glad it was gone.  Now the shakes started.  If I had been smoking in those days  I would have lit a cigarette and probably smoked the whole pack.  Finally  after about 15-minutes  when the stillness was broken by singing birds and scurrying chipmunks  I got up enough nerve to carefully go down to the spot where I had seen this creature.  Was I dreaming?  No  because there  in the loose dirt  I saw a couple of huge  human-like  barefooted tracks where it had crossed the fire line. Then  a raunchy odor hit my nose.  I remember thinking it smelled like a horrendous fart.  In fact  at the time  I decided to call it the â€œFart Creatureâ€.  I know  that is not a very endearing name for such a marvelous being  but thatâ€™s how my scared brain was working that fateful morning. Deciding that now would be a good time to leave the area; I quickly walked back up the hill to where I had been sitting and stood there for a few minutes.  Clearly  I had seen something unexplained.  Now I had to decide if I should tell my dad or just keep quiet.  To tell you the truth  I was afraid to tell my father because I knew he would never believe me.  I thought he would most certainly take my hunting privileges away for seeing â€œbuggers in the hillsâ€.  I began slowly walking back up the firebreak towards my father in the piney flats above me.  I remember now that he had asked me why I had left my deer stand so early.  I think I replied that I was hungry and bored at not seeing a buck right after daylight.  He probably chewed me out for leaving so early  but  at least  I didnâ€™t incur his wrath for telling a â€œbuggerâ€ story! Honestly  for many years I forgot about this incident.  I had to go back to military school the next week and the ensuing years later my life was filled with other things.  Of course  I really never did totally forget about seeing a Sasquatch!  It was only later on in life  after getting married  serving in the military  and leaving California for Florida  that this sighting began to trouble my conscious. How I kept this a secret for this many years I will never know.  I guess I was frightened that people would think I was crazy?  Usually  Iâ€™m the blabby type  sharing plenty of secrets with almost anybody  especially family or friends.  But this deal  oh no â€“ I kept these cards close â€“ too close for too long  really! I swear to all persons reading this report that the facts documented here are recalled to the best of my ability after 44 years and one month in the past! ____________R.R.R._____________  Friday  September 12  2008  p.s.

455,I went with my brother-in-law in the middle of the night  up to Alta Sierra  to sleep for a few hours  then start fishing right at dawn. We were in his flatbed truck that he used for his construction work. I slept in the cab  and he tossed a sleeping bag in the bed of the truck. Around five in the morning (we were both asleep) the truck shook violently back and forth  side to side. The bed of the truck probably moved at least a foot to a foot and a half  about three or four times in a row  quickly. I woke up  and sat straight up  thinking he was playing a trick on me. Right then  the drivers side door opened  and he jumped into the truck  scared out of his wits  screaming  did you do that . Obviuosly not  since there I was in the cab  and at that instant  we both realized that no human would have the kind of strength to move the truck that much. All of a sudden  we smelled a strong  rancid smell... the now familiar skunk/excrement smell. We both realized that whatever shook the truck  was out there somewhere. It was totally black out  no moon  no light of any kind  and we never saw anything. (We didn  t have a flashlight to look around  so we just sat there shaking for quite a while. He didn  t get back into the bed of the truck  needless to say!) We couldn  t figure out what happened. He said maybe a bear ran into the truck  but I didn  t think a bear had the strength  and it wasn  t a  thud  or whatever  it was 3 or 4 full-strength shakes  then the shocks quickly rocked a little and the truck stopped moving. This is a heavy construction truck  so the suspension is strong enough and stiff enough  that you can pile full pallets of bricks  sand  cement  etc.  VERY hard to move that truck with your hands. If you stood on the bed  and jumped up and down with all your might  you would not move the bed anywhere near as much as this moved. I tried it myself. I wish we  d seen something that night  but I never did even equate it with bigfoot until a year or two ago. I  m not sure what it was  but it was big  curious  strong  roams around at night  and smelled like hell! I mean  really really bad smelling. ,Take HWY 49 out of Auburn  CA  towards Grass Valley.

456,My dad  my brother and I were deer hunting just north (about 1/2 mi.) of Donner Lake  CA along the utility road running east-west. They left me  with my dog (a Beagle)  on a large boulder while they went east along the road in the pickup truck. They were going to try to flush some deer out of the brush and have them run towards me in the clearing under the utility lines. They must have driven several miles  because all was quiet until I looked up towards the top of the ridge behind me and to my right (towards Donner Lake) and saw a tall (between 8 and 9 feet tall) apelike creature  sandy brown in color  rather lean and especially gracefull in stride  walking smoothly and rapidly down the top of the ridge towards the utility road  crossing the road aboat 40 yards from where I sat on top of the boulder (which was about 8 feet tall)  with a loaded 30-30 rifle across my lap. My dog  Tippi  ran off barking at the creature  disappearing in the pine trees about 30 yards north of the utility road. I was scarred stiff  but knew that I was downwind of bigfoot and he apparrently did not see me. I had no thought of shooting him  as I did not have any confidence that I could stop him with my 30-30. I could hear my dog--barking for a long time--10 or 15 minutes--  all the time getting furthur away  I waited for about an hour and 30 minutes before the dog finally returned  and my Dad and brother returned about 30 minutes later. I never told anyone about this until many years later--I thought they would think I was crazy. I had never heard of bigfoot at the time  and did not become aware of other sightings until several years later. ,The location was along a powerline dirt road that runs parallel to US80  but is about 1/2 mile to the north of Donner Lake  one ridge over from the lake. ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Fall ,6057,yes
457,The first occurrence took place in 1978. My father and I had moved into the home to fix it and make it  livable  before my mother and brother moved in. I was 12 years old at the time. The property contained 236 acres of undeveloped land. My father had completed our driveway and was sitting on the porch in the evening when he heard what he thought was me walking around the corner of the house in the freshly laid gravel. Since I  m relaying this story to you  you  ve probably figured out it wasn  t me but something else he was faced with  which quickly turned and ran away when it saw him  leaving behind a  wild    musty    skunk-like  smell. Which hung around about 30 minutes (unlike a skunk [ed  odor]  which hangs around for days). Over the next ten to twelve years we had other  visits . Sometimes two or three in the same summer  and then we would maybe go two years without one. They ranged from footprints  to  screams   to smells. Needless to say I took up an interest in sasquatch. I was at the same time intrigued and afraid. I had  avoided  actually seeing one with my own eyes for about nine years  and with that  I could somehow write it off as actually existing (pretty dumb in retrospect with the physical evidence and the number of witnesses in Pope Valley  who incidentally didn  t want to talk about it either). My meeting came one night when me and a friend of mine were sitting on my parents   porch   he  came walking over the crest in front the house  spotted us and took off running like a middle-linebacker in the NFL. I kept waiting  (and hoping)  for it to get down on all fours but it never did. I turned to my friend and he was as shocked and afraid as I was so I knew I had actually seen this thing. It was about 7   tall with what looked like grayish-brown hair covering it from head to toe. The sighting lasted about 5-10 seconds. ,A very rural area between a national forest and a game preserve.

458,I was camping with my friend and her family in Big Sur California.  It was 1974.   My friend Sylvia and I were sitting on the sand near the beach.  I looked up at the cliffs and I saw something big and black running down a very steep mountain side very fast not losing its   balance.  I yelled at my friend to look .  She saw it.  We ran as fast as we could back to the safety of our camp.  I remember we were scared to death and we told her aunt and uncle.  I remember we said it looked like a big gorilla.   We were kind of far away from the mountain  but it looked like the creature could have caught up to us fast if it wanted to.   It was quite a scary experience.  I don  t know where my friend is but her name is Sylvia Txxxx.  I haven  t seen her since 1974.  I don  t know where she is but she could corroborate this story.  It seems like a dream now  but I know what I saw. ,It was at a campground in Big Sur California.  I can  t remember which one. ,Monterey,4,California ,CA,Spring ,6053,yes
459,Some friends and I were camping in Yosemite Park in the fall of 1976. At about 10 00 P.M. we were in our sleeping bags in the tents talking when all the animal sounds going on around us suddenly went quiet. Then we heard a loud   low scream that gradually ended in a high pitch. All of us sat up and were asking the usual question    what was that ?   then as we waited in our tents we heard other campers from around the lake talking and walking our way when we looked out of the tents we saw that they had all there stuff with them and were leaving in a hurry. We asked them what that noise was and they asked us if we had seen the thing run by our campsite ....we were too scared to notice I guess...We watched your special on cable this morning and when they played the vocalizations of what is beleived to be a Bigfoot  I got scared all over again this many years later. The only difference was that what we heard ended in an abrupt higher pitch. ,on the shores of Tenaya Lake in Yosemite National Park ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Fall ,6051,no
460,In 1974  I purchased an arce of land in northern CA in a place called California Pines  a very remote area bordered on 3 sides by a national forest (Modoc Nat. Forest).  To get to the property  which was located many miles from civilazation  you had to travel on a very rough road (one cut with a dozer) so our motor home could not make it to our lot. Near by was a small pond and a campsite that was for the use of property owners. The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across  the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish  without luck). My family(wife  son and 2 daughters) were aware of how quiet it was in the evening  we could not even get a station on the radio. We built a camp fire and were sitting around it watching the field mice run down to the edge of the pond to get a drink. As I remember it was a bright night  the moon was visible overhead. Along about 10 or 11 pm  the wife and kids went into the camper and went to bed. I remained outside by the camp fire trying to get a station on the walkman radio. About 1am  I was putting out the fire when I saw movement on the other side of the pond  I noticed the movement because of the noise this thing was making. At first I thought it was a deer (I was told they were common in the area) so with that thought I headed toward the sound armed with my trusty flashlite. As I approached  the moonlite was very bright  I could see lots of movement in the cat tails but could not see the animal. At this point it hit me that maybe it was a mountain lion  because I could hear a low rumbling sound like a cat purring but much louder. I decided to return to the motor home  as I turned to retrace my steps (I was probably 50 feet from the noise) this huge hulk stood up in front of me and made a loud screeching noise. It raised up to a full standing position  I would say 7 or 8 ft tall  dark brownish hair.  We looked at each other for a moment and then I turned and ran full speed away from him.  When I looked back to see if he was following me  he was walking in the opposite direction toward the deep forest. I stood and watched him until he disappeared in the deep woods. He did not walk like an animal but more like a man. When I composed myself  I went back to the area I saw him at to look for tracks  but all I found was crushed cat tails  an area of about 10 ft in dia was all smashed down  and it smelled like a strong urine smell in the area. I told the family what I saw and to this day they think I saw a deer or some other animal. I tell this story now to my grand children when we go camping. The one thing that struck me about this encounter was after the event was over I felt that whatever it was did not seem threating but just as startled as I was. ,California Pines--an area boarded on 3 sides by Modoc Nat.

461,We were all playing and having fun with a bunch of people at the Cook  s Valley Campground in Piercy. A bunch of the kids were rough-housing and playing  making a lot of noise  when we all took notice of a terrible stench. It smelled like the carcass of a rotting deer and skunk combined. It really stunk! We looked around to see where the smell was coming from  and there at the edge of the tree line stood a huge ape that we here in Garberville recognized immediately as a sasquatch. He had been standing there watching the children hard at play. He never made any attempt to come into the campground any further  but just stood there watching all the activity on the playground. At the nearest  the bigfoot was about 50 feet away from the closest child. He was brown  hairy and stood at least 8 feet tall. This was the last occurrance of a sighting of sasquatch in this area since 1963. ,The sighting happened in Piercy; 12 miles north of Garberville  California  just off old Highway 1 which is now the California Coastal Highway One. ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Summer ,6045,yes
462,When I was 15 yrs. old I and a friend were outside of Coulterville Ca. It was at night on a ranch.  We were in bed looking out a window from a dark room. The window was six feet off the ground.There was a full moon outside. A Sasquach looked in the window and was looking around the room.  We watched it for about 10 minutes.He  d look around the room and then look around outside and look inside again. My friend told me to go outside and look around. When I looked around I could see nothing.The Sasquach had a head larger than a basketball. It stood about 7 1/2 ft tall.  I must have weighed about 400-500lbs.The head looked like an apes head and the eyes were about the size of tennisballs.  Lots of coarse hair.  The hair was dark brown. ,From hwy 99 turn E. on 132 and go about 40mi. Turn L. on Granitesprings Rd. until it intersects with Marshflat Rd. (about 3mi.) ,Mariposa,3,California ,CA,Spring ,6043,yes
463,Early in the morning before light my friend and I decided to hike up a ridge and sit down where we could see a lot of area hoping to see a deer that we could bag. We parked in an area just below the ridge where when the sun lightened up enough we could easily hike up to the top in about 20 minutes. As it got light enough to see the top  we noticed someone already on the ridge wearing what seemed to be black of all things. He had no light  and no gun  and we wondered where he came from because we had been camped there for 11 days  and no one had come by that whole time. We watched him dig around in some brush for at least 30 minutes  pausing occasionaly for long periods to just stare in different directions. We joked that it was probably a hunter from L.A. because anyone would be crazy to wear just black during deer  and bear season. Then he began to walk down the hill right for us  now we never left the truck yet  and he would walk a little ways and the stop and look around just as if he was hunting  but with no rifle. He walked just like a human  so at this time there was no reason to think it was anything but a man. After a little while it was getting light enough to see even better  and he was still walking straight for us. When he was about 50 yards away we both at the same time realized we were not watching a man  but this was a Bigfoot! He walks like a man  but he was not a man. He had jet black  shiny fur  with a reddish color around where his eyes were. At this moment I was ready to run clear home in one leap! I had to see this thing up close  and he had not noticed us yet  so I tried to open the door of the truck real easy so he wouldn  t notice  but that old ford truck was anything but quiet  and he heard the latch release and took one good look before breaking into a run. I tried to bring the scope up to view him closer  but this guy could really move  and I could not get my eye into the scope before he got behind a tree and nev er came out. It took all the nerve in my body to walk over to the tree  but he was not there he flat disappeared. My friend was hollering the whole time not shoot  and thought I was crazy for trying to go find him  or a track  or something. All I know is I have different kind of respect for the back woods now  and I give a lot of room between me and large objects. I was brought up in these woods camping  and hunting every year and only heard of such things. ,The sighting took place at the end of a road leading to a trail head that leads into the back of yosemite park.

464,  In August of 1982  my buddy and I made a weekend trip from Sunnyvale Ca. to Lassen National Park.  Having been there once before four years earlier with a church youth group  and consequently having had a blast  we wanted to camp in the same campground and generally do a lot of the things we had done on our first trip  but without the constraints of adult supervision. We where both twenty years old at this time. We camped at a place called Lost Creek campground  which sits just inside Lassen National Park along its northern border with Lassen National Forest. On the second day we decided to take a late afternoon hike down an old somewhat overgrown logging road just on the other side of the national park/national forest boundary fence.  We knew of this road and its destination because we had hiked it four years earlier.  This road was lined with tree stumps  and had decades of old logging debris  and it had permanent tire grooves in the dirt.  As this road heads north down the slope from our campground it runs about 3000 ft.  until it ends at a fire road running east to west.  We hiked west on this road about 100 yards to where the road runs along side a small meadow to the north. We hiked across this meadow to a creek called Lost Creek  hence the name of our camping site. After soaking our feet in the icy water  my friend said we should probably head back up to camp as it was getting close to 7 00pm and he didn  t want too get stuck down there while it got dark.  We crossed the meadow back to the fire road and started walking east.  We then noticed on the road about 200 yards ahead of us  what at first glance appeared to be a large naked man with a dark complexion  walking away from us.  At second glance I thought maybe he isn  t naked but he  s wearing a fur coat with a pointy hood.  I remember saying to my friend  take a look at this guy . A few seconds later the figure stopped in its tracks and moved to the left side of the road  the whole time with its back to us.  I got the impression that he/it had noticed something and went to investigate.  A few seconds later it continued on its way with a very swift and deliberate gate  arms swinging slightly. I think what sticks in my mind the most was the bawdiness of the shoulders.  In fact  I remember this character had a well defined hourglass figure.  He/it remained on the road for what seemed like a full minute  the entire time it was walking away from us  with his back to us. The more I watched the stranger I thought the situation was.  Eventually the figure disappeared from view  either around a bend in the road or up into forest to the left  I could not determine the direction.  We didn  t say too much about what we had just seen  however we seemed to walk a little more quickly back to camp.  I know I was a little nervous.  I can  t really put a size to this figure  because of the distance at which we viewed it  but if pressed  I would have to say it was over 6  5  tall and about 270lbs.  maybe even 300lbs. The rest of the evening was uneventful  but the next morning at about 5 45am we both were awaken by what sounded to us  to be a series of powerful yelps and growls coming from the general direction of the area where we were hiking the day before.  I don  t know if any other campers in the area heard this. My friend and I never really discussed this event among ourselves; or anyone else for several years  until for some reason  I brought it up once.  We still can  t come to an agreement on what we saw or heard.  I  ve told my wife about the incident  but very few others. I don  t know if my friend has told anyone. ,The incident happened in the Lassen National Forest on a fire road the runs along side Lost Creek.  I believe this road eventually intersects with route 44 to the west.  We got to the road from the Lost Creek campground  which is located off of the Lassen Park Road  which is a few miles east of Manzanita Lake.  From the campground you walk north about a hundred yards or so to a fence next to the amp theater. On the other side of the fence is a logging road that will eventually bring you to the road in question. ,Lassen,4,California ,CA,Summer ,6035,yes
465,I was hunting with my close friend Chris R. in Sonoma County  CA on our family property that is adjacent to Pine Mountain.  We were walking along an old camp road that had become overgrown with brush and scrub. It was obvious that bear had been using this trail as there was a considerable amount of bear sign along the old road.  We got to a point in the trail where there was an overhang of pine limbs over a slight depression on the right side of the old road.  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print  and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground.  We continued to survey the area  and noticed what appeared to be more tracks leading away from this overhang and depression.  I took photos with a disposable camera.  I have the prints  but they did not come out very clear.  Which was a disappointment  but something to look at nonetheless. We finished poking around  and continued on our way.  We got just a bit further down the trail  and we walked through an extremely strong smell of skunk  or wet dog-like odor.  No sooner had you smelled it that is disappeared  but if you took a few steps back it was extremely strong again. I have been hunting and recreating outdoors for many years  and I am very familiar with skunk spray  and how it seems to permeate a large area.  This was not simply the spray of a skunk.  It was very centralized.  It was literally like you walked through it  and it disappeared  then you could turn around and walk through it again. The two of us spent a few moments looking around  and we noticed  something very peculiar.  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell  and the foot prints we had seen  was a large pile of oak acorns.  The strange thing was there was not an oak anywhere near this pile of acorns!  They seemed to have been placed in this location.  They were not a collection of shells from squirrels  they were fresh dropped acorns.  Enough to hold a hungry deer  or two for a little while. We theorized that whatever had been hunkered down under the pine overhang in the depression may have placed these acorns  then set up under the overhang off of the trail in ambush. Our intent was to walk to the back of Pine Mountain  then still hunt our way up to the top of the mountain.  We had used this road for years to access the back of the mountain  and we were very used to the topography  so anything out of the norm would be noticeable to us. Chris and I team hunt very well together and after a short strategy chat  decided to use a 50 step method  one of us would go 50 steps  stop and whistle to let the other hunter know it was their turn to take 50 steps  and then just watch and listen.  We were approximately 130 yards apart. The ground was covered in heavy and dry leaf litter so the going was somewhat noisy.  I had gone nearly three quarters of the way to the saddle at the top  and I heard what sounded like a whistle  but not the whistle I recognized as Chris  .  I also heard what sounded like a very large boulder break loose and roll down the back of the hill.  I had assumed that Chris had rolled it down hoping to kick something out  but based on the last whistle  this rock was rolled from that area  and seemed to be 60 yards to my right  when Chris would have been twice that distance away from me.  I though that maybe he had gotten closer to me as we made our way up  but that would not have been the case in the past.  We work very well together and spacing is everyhting on our team hunts. We got to the top of Pine Mountain  and we had a discusion and he told me that he thought I had rolled the boulder  and vice versa.  I told him about the whistle  and he told me the exact same thing.  He also had this overwhelming feeling of being followed up the hill.  Like something was timing it  s footfalls so as to not be detected.  I have to admit  I felt this way too  even more so after the discussion about the boulder. ,Dry Creek Road comes off of Highway 29 out of Middletown  Dry Creek Road goes into the back country through much privately owned land  to our ranch.

466,My girlfriend (later became wife) and I were traveling on a rural road  Panama Road  e/b e/o Cottonwood Road  that connects the outskirts of Bakersfield  CA  to Lamont  CA  a small town 14 miles outside of Bakersfield. This area is surrounded by agricultural fields  mostly grape vineyards.  I was traveling at approximately 55 mph  that was pushing it for my 65 Mustang  at the time.  As we talked  we both saw something walking very fast  almost a slow jog  across the roadway s/b. I slowed down w/o slamming on the brakes so as not to lose control and try to figure out we were seeing.  We saw its right side and back as it ran into the field.  The head to the shoulders was slouched.  Could not see a neck.  Approximately  6 ft. tall.  Long arms  thick legs. It never looked at us as it crossed.  It was extremely dark  almost shadowy but very much real.  Appeared to be very hairy.  As we passed it   it never looked back. I quickly stopped and began a u-turn at which time my girlfrined yelled at me asking what the hell was I doing?  She knew what I was about to do. I drove back to the location where it ran into the field and hit my brightlights.  Did not see anything.  My girlfriend was yelling at me to get going so I did.  I returned to the area the following day  but it had rained and I could not locate any footprints  too muddy. My wife will only discuss it if I bring it up  aside from that  she never talks about it.  To this day  I have no idea what we saw.  I know that it was not a human as we know it  yet I cannot say that it was a complete animal either. I still drive by there once in while and wonder what was it that we saw that night. ,Freeway 99 into south Bakersfield  east on State Route 119  after crossing Union Avenue  it changes to Panama Road.  2/.10 mile  cross Cottonwood Road  approximatley 1/.10 mile  the sighting. ,Kern,12,California ,CA,Winter ,6029,yes
467,I have reported this incident before. Perhaps it was not close enough to a sighting to publish on your site. I originally said that the incident occurred at Mcgee Creek. I was incorrect. It was Deadman  s Creek. It was Summer. I believe the year was 1970. I was 12 years old or so. My friend and I belonged to the Western Conservation Club and went on many outings with the group. We would work at an area (cleaning it up and restoration) half our stay and play the other half. My friend and I decided that we were going to walk way up the creek to go fishing. More to get away from the adults than anything else. It was mid-afternoon when we started out. The area had very few trails  once you left the immediate camping area. We headed out cross-country staying as close to the creek as possible looking for good fishing holes. We had walked about five miles up the creek towards the mountains when we both got the feeling that we were being watched. We both looked at each other and called each other light-weights and kept on going. We fished for awhile  by now it was late afternoon. We noticed that there were none of the usual sounds that you hear in a forest such as birds  etc. We still had that feeling of being watched. The sky was starting to look threatening as an afternoon storm was heading down the canyon / creek towards us. We started back to camp when the storm caught us and lightning started. A bolt of lightning struck the ground on the other side of the creek and up a ways from our location. Directly afterwards  we heard a growling or grunting sound from the area of the strike. We heard the sound of branches breaking in the brush. The sound was moving up the creek away from us and up the mountain. The breaking branches sounded as if they were high up in the trees. The trees in the area are conifers and the dead branches started about six or more feet up the trees from ground level -- so whatever was breaking the branches  it had to be pretty tall. The object was moving fast because it was soon out of hearing distance. You know as well as I that sound travels a long way in the woods and we were in a canyon so the object was really moving. We never noticed a foul odor or saw anything conclusive. I did  however  see a large shadow moving through the woods briefly. Please understand that although we were very young we had a lot of experience in the back country. We knew what the indigenous animals looked like  their habits and the sounds that they make. This growling did not sound like anything that I ever heard before or since. I know that this will sound funny but a person knows when things are not quite right and this was not right. Just a feeling. We could not return to the area to look for footprints as the lightning strike caused a fire and the camp site was evacuated by the USFS. At the time I had heard about bigfoot  but only up north. I was unaware of local sightings until recently. This thing was not a bear. I thought that at the time. I tried to make it a bear so I could put the incident out of mind  but it just doesn  t add up that it was a bear unless this bear was huge  walking erect and hauling ass. It also did not sound like any bear noises that I  ve ever heard  not that I am a bear expert or anything. ,I think it was Kings or Inyo county  near Bishop off of Highway 395. ,Inyo,6,California ,CA,Summer ,6027,no
468,I do not know whom to contact but I have a story to tell. My name is J. C. and I am a 41 year old Vice President of a bank. I have been harboring an encounter I had for 31 years secretly out of fear of ridicule or shame. But now that I have seen other people have had similar situations  I must tell my story. During September 1972  I was hiking down from a lake with my dad and my friend on a fishing trip. We were at a place called Barney Lake out of Mammoth  California  and were on our way home. After a weekend of camping and fishing we were backpacking out from the lake. I was the lead person going down the trail. I had outpaced my friend J. C. and my dad by about 4 minutes without knowing it as I was moving quickly down the trail. After about 10 to 40 minutes down the trail from Barney Lake (I can  t remember exactly after all these years) I came into a clearing. It was a small flat grassy meadow from the trees which I had been seeing downhill till then. I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow. The first thing I saw was a big white rock boulder near the end of the meadow. The meadow was maybe 20 yards by 30 yards of grass. At the point of the clearing to my left I heard extreme thrashing going on. I looked over to my left to see a large animal bent over with its rear end facing me. It was only about 12 feet away from me. I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish  orange  brown multicolor mix hair to it  and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey  s. I knew this because at this time in my life I spent most of my lunch hours in the library reading zoology and marine biology books. I thought this was very strange because no bear could bend over at the waist and have skin over its rear end like this. In my fear I was frozen  shocked and bewildered at the same time. I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life. At this point it had been maybe 5 or 6 seconds and then the animal lifted up and stood erect. It was enormous. It must have been 8 feet tall or more  and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal. It had been scratching with its hands and grubbing and digging prior to looking for what I thought was food. Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair. I knew this was no bear from my background. I also knew only black bear were seen as an almost extinct species here during this time  and would have been much smaller in height and stature. I got so scared I ran full pack towards that big white rock. I literally dove over the top  pack and all  and snuggled against the rock  so scared to even look  in case the creature heard me. Finally after about 20 seconds or so  I peeked over the rock to see nothing and no one on the trail. Within 1 or 2 minutes  my dad and John came down the trail and into the opening. I started screaming at them  look out  look out   in fear that the creature was still there and would do something to them. They froze   bewildered  looked left to where I was pointing and then back to me in confusion. They were standing at the clearing at the spot I had been at. I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush  twigs and some hair there. We moved on finally and I never spoke of this again except to my dad and a couple of close friends. Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video. Once I saw this  I knew without a doubt this was what I saw. I still kept my story a secret out of fear  but this vision haunts me and will all my life. I know it was so real. I will never forget this and take it to my grave. I am now someone who needs answers and must try and find out that this creature does exist or I will not put my memory to rest. I know what I saw was no figment of my imagination or hoax. I want to seek it out. Anyway  I hope this eye witness helps some where some how. ,From Highway 395 south of Mono Lake  take 203 towards Mammoth Mountain  but turn south to the trailhead to Barney Lake  which starts near Lake Mary. ,Inyo,6,California ,CA,Summer ,6027,yes
469,When I was a young boy  my father would take me backpacking in the Sierra Nevada mountains every summer. When I was 10 years old  my father decided I was strong enough for a long excursion in the wilderness  and we set off for a place called Seven Lakes near Big Pine. We had hiked for a few days when we came to the sixth lake  and we could see the seventh lake just beyond it. Seventh lake was covered with ice and there was snow all around just past where we decided to camp for the night. We thought this would be a good place to stay and explore the next day. During the night a snow storm hit and it became freezing cold  so my father and I put our sleeping bags over us and huddled together for warmth. I kept looking at my father  s watch and hitting the light on it to see when we could expect the sun to rise so we could get warm. It was 3 45 a.m when we heard footsteps walking up the trail towards us. Our tent was right on the edge of the trail  and whatever was out there walking was on two feet and very big  we could almost feel the ground shake as it got closer. My father and I looked at eachother in silence  both of us a bit shocked by what we were hearing. It walked right up to our tent and stood there for about five minutes  completely silent. I have very good senses and I could feel that whatever it was absolutely didn  t want us there. I could feel its anger resonating  I can  t explain how  but I got the most scary feeling in my heart. It wanted us to leave. Then it walked off just as suddenly as it came  but it headed in the direction of the frozen lake  and beyond that the trail went into very rugged wilderness. I didn  t think it was a person because it had no flashlight  was very large  and only an idiot would continue walking on the trail into the wilderness at that time of night  in the middle of a snowstorm. My father and I were quite frightened by our nightime visitor  and when first light hit we instantly broke camp and headed down the mountain without making breakfast  nor saying a word to eachother. We both knew we had to get out of there. Unfortunately  we were so far in the wilderness that we had to camp again that night further down the mountain  but this time we were not visited luckily. My father has a MBA and is a successful businessman  very well liked and trusted in his community. To this day we still talk about the incident from time-to-time  and we still don  t know what it was. At the time the incident happened  I was so scared I didn  t even think to look for tracks  and I don  t think I wanted to. We didn  t notice a smell  but the direction of the wind was going from us towards the creature and I think that may be why we didn  t smell it. We never actually saw it  but it sure didn  t seem to be a man. ,From Big Pine  go west on Glacier Rd. The trailhead is almost at the end of the road (before Glacier Lodge). The trail goes up to the seven lakes  located in Palisades Glacier. This incident occured at the west end of sixth lake  with seven lake a short distance away. ,Inyo,6,California ,CA,Spring ,6027,yes
470,In the summer of 1991 I took my son and nephew fishing with me to North Lake outside Bishop CA. We arrived late Sunday and we set up camp. The following morning we started fishing with no luck  and the mosquitos were eating us alive  so I decide to go back down to the local McDonalds. That afternoon we did alright by catch a few decent size trout.   Mistakenly  I clean the fish at our campsite. I put them away in an ice chest as proof we did have some luck. We went to bed proud of our catch and tired from the sun and the lack of oxygen due to the high altitude [9350 feet]. Needless to say we all fell asleep fast. I donâ€™t know if the dead silence  or if the heavy footsteps woke me up. But I knew someone or something stopped just outside our tent. My nephew asked what is it. I quickly hushed him. I stood up and was able to peek outside to see if it was a bear. Iâ€™d like to mention before I continue that Iâ€™ve had run in bears and mountain lions.  I worked around then with great caution and a bit scared of what may happen if they attack. Fortunately  I never had the feeling that I was in a life or death situation.  What I saw that night made feel I had to leave the mountain as soon as it was safe. The angle I had only allowed me to see the legs. The legs were muscular and human like. Its buttocks would have been at my mid abdomen. I am 5â€™6â€.  Yes  Iâ€™m short but this was Shaquille Oâ€™Neil level.  Hairy  muscular legs  and just huge. Iâ€˜ve been afraid before but never paranoid.  I was frozen and shocked. I shined my flashlight on its legs very briefly through the tent mesh then I turned the light away  pointing it at my chest. It stood there for about a minute or two  but it felt like 5 minutes.  It moved on and I listen for a while. As soon as I felt it was safe  I packed my nephew and son into my car. I grab our bags and some other stuff but the fear was over whelming.  I left the tent and some other camping gear. We made our way home two days early. My son never realized what happened  only to wake up at home Tuesday morning.  Everyone was asking why we were home early.  I never said why  other than that the kids were getting board.   My nephew brought it up 10 years later  and when I told them  I was mocked. So I kept it to myself. ,We were camping and fishing at North Lake in the Sierras above Bishop.

471,NOTE  Please see the following included sections for elaboration of details.  Two of us were driving home from a day of skiing at Mammoth Mountain California. The road was a two lane highway (opposite directions) with a soft dirt shoulder. We were in an open convertible (because the skis did not fit otherwise). The moon was full and the lighting was un-obscured and visibility was (near daylight) excellent. In the distance (well beyond the reach of the High beamed head lights) two of us could see a very large and (completely out of place) thing running ahead of our approaching car. It was on the other side of the road. We slowed  50  40 30mph... now in our headlights. Running on the dirt shoulder  obviously unaware of our approaching auto... There it was  Bigfoot ! At its closest point we were 10 UNOBSTRUCTED FEET FROM IT! EYE TO EYE! ,We were on a two-lane road  slightly elevated highway  with the equivalent of a dirt emergency lane located on the opposite side of the road.  This is where the biped   creature   was running in the same direction as we were driving  but on the other side of the road. From the time   it   came into our completely unobstructed view  to the time we came eye-to-eye (perhaps ten feet away) was perhaps 40-60 seconds. Look at your watch  count the seconds  because the viewing seemed an eternity. The level valley (which the highway was constructed upon) had some knee high shrub for perhaps half a mile on each side of highway then the sharp incline of mountainside with pine trees above. ,Inyo,6,California ,CA,Winter ,6027,yes

473,Approximatly 1992 a friend and I were hiking in the Los Padres National Forest out of Frazier Park CA.We were in the Sheep Camp area and had stopped for a break near a rocky outcroping. I had walked away from where my friend Al was sitting and was looking down into a ravine about 150 ft.below me.The area is heavily wooded  but as I stood there I spotted a slight movement in the flora. I was startled to see something that was dark brownish and vertical (since I would have clearly seen any horizonal part of it  s body from my vantage point.)I yelled for my friend  Hey!Al!Come here!  Unfortunatly  he was tired and very uninterested... Whaaaat?... Come here! What the Hell is THAT?!!  At my yell the thing looked up at me. It had been standing sideways from my view and cocked it  s head up and to the rear on it  s right side.I could see it had a face not too unlike a human. Then it took off thru the brush before my friend got within ten feet of the ledge. He did not see a thing! I did not detect any odor as I understand is sometime reported but it was down in a ravine.I have hiked extensively thoughout the Sierra Nevada Range and all over for the past 25 years and have never seen anything like that. ,From Los Angeles 60 miles to Frazier Park.

474,In the summer of 1994 I was camping with my son on the Kern River in a public campground.  Huge boulders on the bank of the river and more boulders inside the rushing river.  After we barbequed we found it difficult to move about the campsite because of the huge rocks everywhere. I actually slipped and banged my knee on one of those boulders. I was in a small tent and my son Ron slept in the Ford Tempo.  He is a sound sleeper.  I am not.  During the night he awoke me and said something was moving around in the blackness outside his car.  I told him to go back to sleep and it was cold so I bundled up and tried to sleep despite the pain from my banged knee.  Right as the sun came up I heard the loudest scream right outside my tent.   It was inhuman - much louder than a man  s voice and of an alarming intensity and pitch.  I unflapped one of the tent windows and looked out  expecting to see I knew not what.  Everything was sunny and looked normal. A frightening experience. ,It was a public campground right outside a small town with large boulders right on the Kern River.  Little rapids all along the river at this point. Tent was under a bunch of scraggly trees. ,Kern,12,California ,CA,Summer ,6029,no
475,This was a vocalization by an unknown animal. The following event happend on the second night of a two night deer-hunting trip. The woods were alive with animals and fresh sign -- scat (bear and deer); prints (bear  deer and cat). We were both in sleeping bags and in a small two-man tent since 2000 (mainly because the temperature dropped so quickly and it was the warmest place to be). Sometime after 0000 and before 0400  my hunting partner and I were woken out of a sound sleep by these sounds. The clear  cold air in the mountains makes it difficult to estimate the distance of the vocalizer (s). I would guesstimate .5 to one mile -- far enough away that neither of us felt  threatned  enough to get situp with our pistols. Number of vocalizations  5; within seconds/minutes of each other. First vocalization  from the northeast. Second vocaliztion  5 seconds or less after the first vocalization; from the northeast. Third vocalization  10 seconds or less; farther away (fainter) than the first two vocalizations; from the east/northeast. Forth vocalization  5 seconds or less; farther away (fainter) than the first two vocalizations; from the east/northeast. Fifth vocalization  1-3 minutes after the forth vocalization; closer (slightly louder) than first two vocalizations; from the south. Description of sound  Unknown. Myself  hunting partner and other hunters spoken to the following morning are undecided as to what made the sound. Possibly a cat  bear cub (why would it be out at night?)...sound variously described as resembling a seal  though higher pitched and faster; somewhere between a coughing growl and a scream. We joked that it could have been bigfoot  except we were too far south. After checking your site  I find I am in error! After the trip  and having just watched the special on Discovery Channel (?) I checked out your site and some of the recorded vocalizations -- they were enough to put the hair up on the back of my neck; very close to what we heard. I am glad I didn  t listen to them before the trip! ,Piute Mountain region of the Sequoia National Forest  located 20 miles southeast of Lake Isabella.

476,I am a long term seasonal with the US Forest Service.  I do know the different tracks the wildlife leaves behind. What I and a co-worker saw was not a typical wildlife track. On this day  we decided to go to the Piute Mountain to cover illegal OHV trails.  As the day was going we covered 5 illegal trails around the Landers meadow area then decided to head for the Weldon and Woolstaff meadow area.  As we were heading towards the Weldon Meadow area a rancher stopped us to ask if we saw some of his cattle.  Are reply was  No  if we see them we  ll let you know.   Never found them.  At Weldon meadow we stopped for lunch and this was are next area to work.  During lunch  the co-worker went to do a little exploring.  After about 10 minutes the co-worker yelled to me to come and see and ID some wildlife tracks.  These were not wildlife tracks.  We saw what looked something like a human foot track but  it was way to big with a slight distortion in the toes.  The tracks measured about 16 inches long and 7 inches wide.  The tracks looked like the ones I saw last year at the Six Rivers National Forest.  I snapped a picture of the track and looked to see wher the tracks were going.  The tracks followed the barbed wire fence.  The meadow area is used for cattle grazing.  The co-worker asked me what it meant.  I said   It  s possible that Bigfoot was looking for food or was heading for the spring at the end of the fence.   We then proceeded to do are work so that we could finish this area and head for the other area.  We finished and headed towards the Woolstaff Meadow Area.  Once down there we proceeded to do are job.  While working on the project  I spotted the same tracks that we saw earlier.  The tracks cut across the trail and headed towards some rock outcroppings.  This was enough to spook my co-worker and so we left the area.  Back at the office the co-worker told what we saw and was laughed at.  I didn  t tell them that I snapped pictures of the tracks.  I too would have been laugh at. ,From Lake Isabella - head east on hwy 178 to Kelso Valley Rd.  On Kelso Valley Rd - travel 17 miles to a dirt on the right hand side.

477,While deer hunting my father in law and I had become lost while following a game trail we took a short cut from one hill to the next and had crossed a ravine at the bottom as we crossed the ravine we found another game trail as we followed this trail I noticed large 14 to 15 inch human type foot prints impressed deeply into the trail these track led down a hill until the terrain became to difficult to follow. ,Location is north of golf meadow on top of mount breckenridge as for the exact location of tracks to difficult to be exact we were lost however i will be making an attempt to relocate the area. ,Kern,12,California ,CA,Summer ,6029,yes
478,I am a land surveyor who was performing a large boundary survey adjacent to The Tejon Ranch while driving along an old ridge line road  I encountered a black figure amongst the trees.  I originally took it for a tall tree stump or sprag until it began to move.  After it began moving I thought it may be a bear.  As I came closer  I realized that it was too thin and tall to be a bear.  Finally as I came within 75 feet of it  it sprinted across the road and disappeared into the trees. ,A few miles from Frazier Park. ,Kern,12,California ,CA,Winter ,6029,yes
479,In late Sept. 1989  I was deer hunting about 5 miles west of Walkers pass along hwy 178. I had driven a short ways off of the hwy and then walked in about 1/4 mile to a rocky bluff that was at the base of a very large steep mountain (I believe it was Pinion Peak). While sitting there in the dark  I continually had the feeling that I was being watched. I have had this same feeling 2 other times  and in both situations I spotted a Mountain Lion watching me from a distance.  As gray light came  I started glassing the steep dense mountain behind me  looking for whatever it was that was watching me. I really could not see very much as it was still fairly dark and the brush was so thick. I cannot remember how long it was that I was glassing the area when a very loud  booming scream echoâ€™s from the mountain behind me several hundred yards up. It sounded almost like a terrified woman screaming as loud as she could. At first  I thought that someone was playing a hoax on me. The more I looked at how steep that mountain was  the time of day (early morning because I only had gray light)  and how dense it is up there  the more uneasy I became. I left the area immediately. ,Highway 178  approx 5 miles west of Walkers Pass. It was off of a small dirt road heading S/W towards the base of Pinion peak.

480,I was about 14 years old riding a horse on a ranch that my family owned. The ranch location is Tehachapi  California. I was on a trail going towards the edge of the forest  still on our property. When I reached the edge of the forest  there was a dead cow.  It had been dead for some time now  because it was mostly just bones. When I looked a round  still on my horse. That  s when I saw Bigfoot. He was really tall  black and so human like. He looked at me  but was not scared. I said to myself that  s bigfoot. Bigfoot had one hand and arm leaning against a giant tree  and he looked to be both man and ape. Bigfoot looked right at me  and we both just looked at each other. I was so scared I turned around and went back to the ranch. I  ve block this out of my mind for many years  I believe from being scared to death. I spoke to my Dad about the ranch  do we still own 10 000 acres and the ranch. He said no  and is now 90 years old. I asked him did anybody ever say they saw bigfoot. â€œHe said yes.â€  I could take you to the spot where I saw him  and I  m sure someone who lives in that area  would say they have seen him also  why  because he is there. He is out there  living. This happened 28 years ago but I remember it very clear now for some reason  and how he looked at me.  ,The Forest of Tehachapi  Ca.

481,I lived in the High Desert of California in Ridgecrest  CA in Kern County from 1980 to 1985. I did a lot of hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I never saw or heard anything unusual during that time. MY Mom  Sister (& Family)  and Brother and his Family still live there. My 19 year old son and I were visiting various family members from Sept 17 through Sept 27 2007 in Ridgecrest  CA. My sister took me and my son up to the Siebert family gold mine  cabin  and mining equipment on the 24th of September. We had spent about an hour at this location and we were preparing to leave. My sister was in the Port-a-Potty and my son and I heard this high pitch scream like a woman hollering  and it sounded just like the ones we heard on your sight. Just like the sound that was reported in the BFRO Report # 9426 (Class B)  which is only 7 miles from that site. We yelled back thinking it was a woman in trouble and there was no reply. I asked my sister if she heard it she said no. I told her what we heard and she told me that she had horse backed and hiked through this area and had never heard anything that would make that kind of sound. She has lived and in this area since 1980. I asked her Husband whoâ€™s an avid hunter  horseback trail rider and hiker in these mountains and he said that he knew of no animal that made a high pitch scream in this area. My brother- in-law also has lived in Ridgecrest  CA area all of his life. In searching for the animal that made this sound on the internet  I found this site with the sound that I had heard. It is located in Kern County  up Indian Wells Canyon Rd  off California Highway 14  at Latitude 35Â°41  47.44 and Longitude N117Â°57  54.36 W  near Owens Peak. ,The Sound originated at higher elevation than ours. to the south of us.

483,My name is J. M.  and my friend  s name is R.S.  and we were hiking about a mile above Sand Canyon  near Tehachapi  California  he lost his prescription sunglasses  and we split up to search for them. As I was hiking  I saw a very strange track. It looked human  but it was larger than any human foot print. Also  unless a human was walking a mile from the road barefoot through rough terrain  so it couldn  t have been human. I met up with R.S.  and on the way back I showed him the print. He is an Army veteran from Iraq and an avid hunter  and he was simply shocked by that footprint. He said to me   J. look  you can even see the toe prints! This creature has to be at least 7 feet tall!  We looked at each other. I asked him   How old do you think that print is?   He answered   It looks to be about 3 days old.  We both decided  after finding his sun glasses  we should head back to the car  while keeping a VERY sharp look out for anything strange. After we had reached home  it started to snow. We both realized it was very fortunate that we got to see that  because the snow would have wiped it out. ,You take 58 East from Tehachapi and exit on Sand Canyon Road. You go for about a mile up Sand Canyon Rd. and then turn left off of this road and onto this unmarked dirt road for about 1/10 of a mile  or until you get to the area where people bring stuff out to shoot for fun.

485,I cannot say this is a Bigfoot event.  I did not SEE what was happening - I only HEARD it. I was outside early one morning in June  2005 - around 0600 - when I heard perhaps three dogs start to bark.  They were perhaps two or three blocks away (the forest is very near there) when they began. This went on for a couple of minutes until the dogs began to bark louder and more fiercely.  Then I heard a very loud howl  which certainly didn  t sound like any dog I  ve ever heard.  It reminded me of a Gibbon call in the zoo; more ape-like than dog. The dogs continued to bray  and the howler got louder and tended to drown them out. It did not sound like a fight but rather  a bunch of animals having a verbal argument over their respective territories. This went on for several minutes - perhaps 5 - until the animals grew tired of their noisy discourse.  It presently stopped. I did not see any of my neighbors out and about so am not sure who if anyone else heard this. I am not a believer in Bigfoot per se  but since being up here and that episode  I have to wonder. ,I live near Susanville California in a small community just off Eagle Lake Road (which branches off Highway 36 about four miles west of Susanville proper) surrounded by the Lassen National Forest.

486,My husband  our mastiff mix dog  and myself live in a small town called Susanville  California. It is located in Lassen County. We have lived in these parts for almost our whole lives  so we are quite familiar with our surroundings and  wildlife. This incident is fresh as itâ€™s been less than a week since it happened. We had decided to go camping at an campground I found by accident on Google maps. Just a run down one camp spot located about half mile off highway 36 in Lassen county. The camp area is called Old Ferdonyer Campsite. Has a small creek that runs along it. We normally camp at a location called Roxey Peacon Campground which is a mile or so before this campground ground off the same highway. We have been camping there for 10-15 years with no incidents or complications. My husband and I have lived in these parts for 30+ years and have felt more than comfortable going camping alone or with family  without a second thought. We had explored this new place we found a couple times during the day after finding it and then decided weâ€™d camp their one evening. We arrived at the sight between 6 15-6 30pm and set up camp. My husband started a small fire and began cooking steaks we brought with us. Our dog acted normally and was being lazy laying in the dirt. It was completely dark by the time we finished cooking. We kept the fire going just to keep small critters at bay. We could here them around us going to the creek and walking around. Our dog is pretty lazy and decided to get in the car to sleep. My husband was standing next to my chair finishing his food when I heard what sounded to me like a teenage boy hoots and hollers coming from below us like on the highway. My husband didnâ€™t hear it a first until I said something about it as it was still going. We listened in complete silence. My husband turned to me and said that wasnâ€™t human. Then the scariest growl  howl I donâ€™t even know how to explain went off about 100 yards from behind us. My husband almost dropped his plate. It lasted only 5-10 seconds before whatever was at the bottom of the hill answered. Behind my husband up another hill where power poles run   another faint howl/ scream went off. We were in shock and could only stare at each other until it went silent. We both knew that was nothing we had ever heard in these woods and it was time to go. Weâ€™ve heard coyotes  wolves  fox  bear. This terrifying sound was none of the above. It was communicating with more of them. Coyote will do roll call on then howl/yapping. This sounded nothing like that! My dog refused to get out of the car at this point. We rushed in the dark to pick up everything an soon was making our way down the mountain to get home. We havenâ€™t been back  and to be perfectly honest I havenâ€™t been out in the woods since. Something I loved to do in a daily basis with my doggie. Too afraid and the sounds of that night still haunt me. We were at the camp site for exactly 3hrs 47 mins. ,This is thick forest area  and is 12 miles from our home town. Campsite is not advertised off highway  we had never even known it was there. Before making your way up Fredonyer Pass there is a small turn out and at the moment has an orange  road work sign posted. Coming from Susanville the road is to your Right. Turns to dirt  immediately and forks  you stay to the left which goes up the hill parallel with the highway. The road isnâ€™t bad at all  very easy even for a small car to navigate. When you get to the top you will cross the creek and see on your left that you can take road that goes down to a campsite with one fire pit. It loops around and back up to the road you came in on  when you go to leave. [ The location is  Old Freydoner Campground .

487,Dear Sirs  This early 1970s sighting was not of my own. I was a boy when my brother-inlaw of that day and one or two of his hunting friends had an excellant and fairly long term sighting  both via their eyes and through high powered rifle scopes. However I can relate some of this information to you and even put you in touch with two of the possible three people  can  t guarantee they will talk with you about the sighting  but one never knows. In fact I spoke with my ex-brother in-law about this earlier this evening because I happened upon your website and explored it.  What is very significant is that Sam and Don had every opportunity to shoot this animal and/or person and thought about it  but could not because it looked to human! Only THREE DAYS later Big Foot reports hit the news. My father and Sam AKA Sandy  in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter  and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum  CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior. Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall. They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon  (don  t remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam  How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear. About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident. Until now I have more or less left the man alone about it. Today he is a Plant Manager for a large trailer company. Don still lives in Baldwin Park  CA but maybe moving to San Diego  CA. I seldom cross paths with Don nor have I never pursued the matter with him. If you folks are interested I can put you in touch with both of them but you may have to settle for what I have related. Without the permission of at lest one of the actual witnesses it might not be right to post this information. As for myself today I am 40 years old and drive for MTA and I am use to making out reports. I understand the need for accuracy without exaggeration. I hope this relayed information was not to long winded and useful. Tim P.

488,This the first of three so-called sightings. Me and my fishin   buddy  Greg  were fishing the back side of Morris Dam  knockin   shi_ out of Smallmouth bass and an occasional huge trout or crappie. It  s not legal to trespass there  so we are very quiet and do not use lights. We are one with nature  so-to-speak. At around 3 30-4 00 a.m.  we started back to the car. A quarter mile walk through dense brush  across the river (up to waist deep). We used deer trails  like tunnels  to get through the thick brush. We grabbed our hefty stringer (no fish story) and headed into the bush  without really speaking. We knew the routine well. About 50 yards into the bush  Greg and I both noticed that someone (human) was walking in front of us  about 20 feet ahead. We both stopped. The footsteps took two steps more  then stopped. Greg and I looked at each other  surprised  and simultaneously  drew our Buck knives. We couldn  t see anything. We proceeded cautiously  our knives drawn. The footsteps continued in front of us. After about 30 feet  we came to the edge of a clearing and stopped. Two more steps and  it  stopped again. Only this time in the middle of the clearing. We looked at each other  looked back at  it   and  simultaneously  said  Who  s there?   It  turned 90 degrees up river and took off running through dense brush  in the black of night  like a halfback for the Rams  like no human can! , ,Los Angeles,9,California ,CA,Summer ,6037,no
489,In 1976 while night hunting for bobcats on the fringe of the San Gabriel Wilderness Area I called in BF while using a dying rabbit call. I heard it scream so loud that the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps all over my whole body. I have been hunting now for 34 years and besides hunting 8 of the 11 western states I  ve also hunted the deep interior of Mexico and I have never heard anything like that before! It was the only time I have truly been frightened! Even though I had a high powered rifle I knew by the shear volume of the Blood Curdeling Scream that what ever it was it was too big to kill with my .243 cal. It sounded like it was mad at me and kept moving to my right trying to get down wind of me. I figured that my very powerful Aircraft Landing Light that I was using to hunt with must have blinded him and hurt his eyes because as he was circling me trying to wind me he never looked my way thus allowing me to catch his glowing eyes. ,About 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile south of the West Fork River on a road that paralells the road that comes off of hwy 39 and goes back to Cogswell Resevour.

491,This is what you might call a stretch  but here goes anyway  About 15 years ago  when I was 17-18  I went on a hike with a friend trying to reach Smith Mountain  on the edge of the San Gabriel Wilderness. We made it up to the saddle where the trail goes downhill into the wilderness  and where we were supposed to leave the trail and go south up the mountain  and decided we didn  t feel like going any further. I  m assuming we rested for awhile  and I remember just talking and hanging out. As we were getting up and ready to go  we heard a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby. We stopped talking and listened  and it was a very low sort of growl/snuffling sound. My first thought was that it was probably a bear  but that ultimately I had no idea what it was  and it sounded like it was growling at us. The bushes along the trail there were very high  such that we couldn  t see through them. It scared the hell out of us and so we quickly hoofed it back down the trail. I  m not sure if we ever spoke about it again  except to maybe say I wonder what it was  that was scary  etc. But afterwards I actually looked through field guides trying to figure out what was making the noise. I knew that bears  mountain lions & bobcats are relatively prevalent in that part of the San Gabriel Mountains  so assumed it was probably one of those. But  after browsing around your site  and seeing several sightings near the SG Wilderness listed  I  m beginning to wonder. In retrospect (although it could be my overactive imagination)  it sounded a bit apelike. VERY low-pitched  so that we almost couldn  t hear it at all  and had to ask each other   Do you hear that?  Take it as you must; I just think it  s interesting in the context of the other sightings in the area. I only wish I could remember any more details  and that we had had the cajones to hang around longer and check it out further. ,It was on the trail leading into the San Gabriel Wilderness from the east  at the saddle on the wilderness border.

492,Me and a friend at the time were hiking in the Angeles National forest. My friend was just out of boot camp USMC and we started hiking as often as time would allow. We were hiking down a small stream bed that went down hill. The stream was all dried up and it was mostly rock hopping until we got to the bottom of the hill  at one point there is a small section off to the side that is just dirt and makes for a much easier walk down to the bottom. When we got to the bottom we hiked a bit more but as the sun started to go down  we headed back up the same hill/creek bed. I followed my own boot tracks back up as I was tired of rock hopping  while going up  the smell in the air was horrible  like rotten eggs or portable toilet  I then noticed on one of my tracks laid a dead ground squirrel  right over my boot track. I pointed this out to my friend and as soon as I did this  a loud banging over a short hill side was heard  it was coming from about 35-50 yards away from us. It sounded as if it was a large log being hit against a tree. I looked at where the noise was coming from and noticed the tops of the trees were swaying back and forth; all this time of the swaying of the trees the pounding on them could be heard. Then the pounding stopped and a loud groan/scream was heard from the same area as the pounding of the trees. I have never heard anything like it. Iâ€™ve heard Mt Lion  Black bear  this was nothing like that  and was very-very loud  to the point is was damn scary. My friend asked if we should look over the small hillside to see what was making the noise. I said no way  and he agreed. When we started walking away the banging and screaming would stop  but as soon as we stopped it would proceed with the groan and screaming and the trees would start swaying. We finally got out of there and my friend did not want to talk about what had happened. ,It was up the Angeles Crest Hwy  Not sure on exact mileage  but I would say about 10-15 miles maybe a little bit further up Angeles Crest Hwy  this road can be reached off the 210 Freeway up foothill blvd. ,Los Angeles,9,California ,CA,Spring ,6037,no
493,First  as a matter of background  I want to tell a little about myself. It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service  I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent  working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background  you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer. That being saidâ€¦ the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event  I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It didâ€¦. To a T! Only a few months ago  I spoke with my brother in law  a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the eventâ€¦. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would  buy into  such a story  had he not been semi involved. Anyway  this is what happened  My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area  and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills  trying to get into prime shape. In May  we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called  The old campground  because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So  we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and  though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us  we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs. My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also  offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After allâ€¦ this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area  so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun  with ammo for both. The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact  were you to traverse it to its end  you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway  which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground  and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot  next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Thenâ€¦â€¦ night fell. As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights  we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up  frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person  slowly walking around our site  making no effort to conceal his presence  judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent  Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud.  Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!  Again  we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves  wondering if it could be a bear or something  but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot  I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable. The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night  roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was  began to move again  still left to right  in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later  was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around  but appeared  from the casual sound of the slow walking  to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats  we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road  and carrying our weapons  we ran the entire way  about three miles more or less  back to the main highway  San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night  curled up in a concrete drainage ditch  waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so  a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again  it was a long night! The next day  we hiked back to the site  expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise  everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things  and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision  and instead  laid our sleeping bags out in an open area  above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such  night fell again. That night  just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall  Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes  because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left  both holding weapons  we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road  facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual  as I have since read about other sightings. The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at usâ€¦.almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig  s chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said   Do you see that? Are we seeing this?  Craig said  â€œWhat do we doâ€? â€œWhat should we do?  We both started to walk backwards as we spoke  very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments. Then  and I will NEVER forget the detail of thisâ€¦â€¦ he just slowly and very casually turned to his left  and began to walk into the forest. When he did that  Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other.  Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?  As we talked  we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night  the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods  breaking deadfall  twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again. The next day  Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side  we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom  how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped. That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it  I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California. ,Going North from Santa Clarita  get onto the San Francisquito Canyon Rd. for approximately fifteen miles  then take the dirt road on the left which would be the South Portal Canyon Rd. which is just a couple miles before you get to the Green Valley turn off. Take the dirt road (itâ€™s a fire road that leads to Grass Mountain) for about 3/4 of a mile. You will pass an old church camp on the right...keep going. Start looking for two old mine shafts...one on the right and the other on the left. You are now in the right area. ,Los Angeles,9,California ,CA,Summer ,6037,no
494,I left my parents house on my way back to NAS Lemoore  Ca. As my buddy and I were heading towards Gorman on 138 (Lancaster Road)between 200th street west and 280th street west  we both saw something to our right running through the desert. It had to have been 7 plus feet tall  thin and long stringy hair hanging off its body. Arms seemed long with a long stride. I didn  t believe what I saw  about a minute later my buddy asked if I had seen something  I said yes. He then described exactly what I saw. It was dark and it really spooked us. We took off quick  to this day I know I saw something and it puts a chill down both our spines when we talk about it. Friends and family think I  m crazy  I know what I saw. Being much older now  I wish I would have gone back for proof  foot prints or something. ,Area located between Highway 14 and Highway 5 on Highway 138 at the northwest end of the Antelope Valley in Los Angeles  County. ,Los Angeles,9,California ,CA,Unknown ,6037,yes
495,On a day after the snow had fallen  we went hunting up in the Lake Hughes area in California. There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad  and myself and 2 good buddies. Well  the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us  my wife  s uncle is gone from his cabin and won  t be back any time soon  so why don  t we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch. Well  he lives by Lake Hughes  s road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this  we heard the horses behind the house or cabin  running around and making all kinds of noise. We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But  man were they going nuts!!!  So  we all said to each other  let  s get over there and see what  s up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print  s and smelled something like a dog that  s been wet and rotten egg  s mixed. Well  the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate. We went over to the prints  and I  m 6-5 at that time  and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made  with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also  2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider. Then I tried to step that far with my step  and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that  even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape  could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far  and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did  they don  t walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was  it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods  and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it  but we got scared and left that ranch. I have told this story to a few people  and they look at me like  it could be  but you can tell  they don  t think this is real.  But  when you see things like this  you just know something is out there. Nobody could change my mind on this one as  I know what I seen and it was not set up as  nobody knew we were going to his ranch  and the next ranch over  nobody was home there either. So  the only thing that could be is  this was real and not faked. Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill. I know something is going on up there. N. F. ,I was with others and was driven to the cabin. I don  t know where it is really  but  I do know it was in the lake Hughes area and we turned off of Lake Hughes  s road to get to his house or ranch. My buddy was the post Master of Alturas  Ca  and has retired from there now. I have not spoken to him in a long while. We got lost from each other in life  s struggles. LOL. He would know of this place and all. My dad does not remember either. This was a long time ago  and I will never forget it.  Ever! ,Los Angeles,9,California ,CA,Winter ,6037,yes
496,I was a girl.  I think it was 1969-70 and I was 10-11 years old.  I was sick and sleeping on the couch in the living room.  I heard our dog whining. He never whined. No stranger let alone an animal could come close to our dog as he was an agressive watchdog. The whining is what woke me up.  I looked out the window from the couch and then looked again trying to focus. It was dark and everybody else was sleeping. I saw a dark outline of a creature looking into the front room.  I saw its silhouette against the night sky.  It had to have been taller than 6 foot  and the window  if I remember correctly  was off the ground 3? feet and the window itself was 4? feet tall.  The creature took up the width of the window and there probably was about 6-8 inches of moonlit sky showing above its head.  It made no sound.  It just stood there looking in.  I don  t remember anything else.  I probably thought I must be dreaming  but the impression of something watching me never left me and I never told anyone about it until I told a trusted friend about a year ago.  However  other members of my family  including myself at that period of time  heard sounds that summer--like a low  steady whistle  sounding almost like a wind blowing through a groove of some kind.  This happened more than once.  When one of my uncles investigated with a rifle one night while we were playing cards  he came back shaken and unable to explain why.  The night would be silent except for the whistle noise. Another time  I went exploring down the creek which ran out of a pond.  I got to the bottom of the ravine.  There was a smell  like sulphur  or something rotting  at a place where the water pooled.  It scared me and I ran back up the mountain.  I did not tell anyone because I was not suppose to go beyond the sight of the house. ,A 40 acre site with ranch style house  two ponds  located in a rural site  off approximately 1/2-1 mile off Highway 140 at Guadalupe Pass  keep to the left. ,Mariposa,3,California ,CA,Spring ,6043,yes
497,Not much  really  but around 1993 or so I lived  in Yosemite Nat  l Pk. for a few years.  While running accross a talus field in a remote area of the western Clark range  I came across pits in the talus where granite blocks had been lifted up and stacked in neat piles about 3 or 4 feet high.  The rocks were angular  about 2 to 3 feet long  and the biggest of them may have weighed a couple hundred pounds.  The resulting pits in the talus were maybe 5 feet deep.  There was one big pit of that size and 1 or 2 less distinct ones perhaps half as deep.  The area was at least a couple of miles from any trail  or any prominent location that anyone would go to  like a lake or a climbing area.  As I recall  I was basicly running in a straight line  more or less  from the Clark Range to the Mist Trail region. I read Bigfoot books as a kid  and immediately recognzed them as Sasquatch sign  but since I was in a hurry  and not too sure if I belived in him or not  I only spent a few minutes in examination. Bigfoot foraging for rodents?  Quien sabe?  This was definately not trail construction  as it was in a very obscure area without tourist acsess   but why waste time lifting boulders in the middle of nowhere? As far as my credibility goes   I grew up in an  outdoors family.   I lived in the park about 5 years and got around quite a bit.  I am literaly an expert climber and outdoorsman with over 30 years afield.  With only minimal bragging  I would put my tracking and mountaineering ability on par with anyones.  I know what I saw  just not what did it. ,It was a while ago  and I was running about 20 miles a day in the mountains  so  western Clark Range  is about as specific as I can be without a lot of conjecture. ,Mariposa,3,California ,CA,Summer ,6043,no
498,My encounter took place in Albion  Mendocino County Calif. in the summer of 1966 when I was 15 years old.  My father was a commercial fisherman  and had his boat docked up the Albion River about 250 or 300 yards at the boat docks.  We lived in Ukiah  and came over to see my Dad to bring supplies to him and visit at least twice a week. Soon after  we put a trailer on the flats near the boat dock  and moved to the coast permanently.  The encounter happened one evening just before dark  as the sun was just going down over the hill. My parents  younger sister  and younger brother were on the boat and getting ready for bed. It was before 8 p.m.  My older sister and myself had to sleep in the car as there wasn  t enough bunks on the boat for us to sleep. We had blankets and pillows on the seat to sleep on.  The car was a 1957 two-door Pontiac Chieftain. I had the back seat and she the front. I remember it being too early and light out to want to go to sleep. We sat there and talked as teenagers will do. Across the river was a steep rolling hillside that had sheep grazing on it that belonged to a man named Paul Anderson. We had the windows down as it was summer and very nice out. We were interrupted in our talking by the sounds of sheep crying out in unison and baaing in a way that didn  t sound normal for sheep. We both jumped up and looked out the right side windows trying to see what was after the sheep. We could see the sheep running frantically towards the west side of the hillside pasture.  The sheep were scattering in different directions  separating into smaller bunches. To the left  and upper part of the field  we both spotted two very large and hairy animals chasing the sheep.  We thought that they were bears running on their hind legs like trained animals would do. It was very alarming for us to watch as these bears were terrorizing these poor sheep. Our position from the attack was about 150 yards or more. We watched as these big animals chased the sheep for what seemed like hours.  In reality  the whole chase scene was about 20 or 30 minutes. As it got dark  we were sure that the bears would swim the river and come for us next. We locked the doors and hid under the blankets for the rest of night.  It seemed like an eternity til morning came and we could finally get out of the car and go to the boat to see our parents. We told them what had happened  and I know that they thought that we had stayed up all night dreaming up that story. That morning  we were up at the post office near where the attack had occurred  and people were talking about the sheep being killed by a wild pack of dogs that were roaming around. The Sheriff  Sam Costa said that it was unusual for dogs kill and eat only the belly and insides of the sheep. We heard about the wild dogs for years after that  every time livestock were killed and mutilated by a predator. I never forgot what I saw and heard that night  and now know that it wasn  t bears or wild dogs. ,On hillside above Albion Flats  on the south side of the Albion River.

499,I was deer hunting in Mendocino County in Northern California near Dos Rios close by to Covelo where there have been continual sightings. I was walking down canyon and noticed a human walking about 1300 yards below me  so I checked it out.  The human did not have any clothes on  and was not carrying a rifle  and was coming my way up canyon.  I watched the bigfoot as he came nearer  to try and figure out what it was.  As the bigfoot became almost even with me across canyon  it disappeared into the manzanita  about 80 yards away.  I then heard a jeep on the above dirt road. By the time I looked back to where the bigfoot was  he already had come back out of the brush and was walking uphill. He was about 7   tall and had a slender body like a basketball player with big strong shoulders  and a real skinny waist. The legs were really muscular  and strong.  The arms were long  as were the fingernails  and fingers. He had no clothes on whatsoever  and the bigfootâ€™s body was covered with about 2  of hair with a few bald spots showing skin.  Its hair was black  and cut off about even with the upper neck. Its forehead was gunpowder gray with the temple area being purple red down the side of the face partway then dark tan.  The face was flat with a flat nose.  It walked hunched over with his arms at a dead hang as he walked. After I made this sighting I went back the following weekend to look around some more for what I had seen. I walked up the same trail bigfoot walked up  and found a steer skull laying in the trail.  I picked the skull up and looked at it  and it was completely clean underneath without a cobweb or a speck of dirt. I sat it down exactly how I found.  I went back two weeks later and the skull was gone.  Maybe it was a migration route  and others were following. ,Baxter Ranch ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Summer ,6045,yes
500,I was deer hunting with some fireman friends and it was the end of the morning hunt  about 10 am  when Bob and I were watching 2 doe struggling to climb a shale cliff  as we heard a lot of noise down below in a wooded gully. A minute later  we saw an elderly man climbing up the steep hill towards us. We waited for him to reach the top to see what he had seen that morning in the way of deer. When he reached us we could see he was very scared and pale. He could hardly talk  he was breathing so hard. But after a couple minutes he was able to tell us that he had just seen bigfoot at the bottom of the gully. We looked at each other and smiled trying not to laugh and the guy got angry saying he didn  t care if we believed us [sic] or not  he knows what he saw and it was huge. We still didn  t believe him until he said   I paid $700 dollars for my deer rifle 3 years ago and I just dropped it and ran.  Then we noticed that he didn  t have his rifle and the goosebumps hit us both. The guy just kept walking down the old logger trail and left. Bob went down and found the guy  s rifle. It was a beautiful Browning 30-06 with scope. We looked for the guy  s camp but he had apparently left. I believe this old man saw what he saw !!! ,Little Doe Rock  just above Covelo Indian Reservation  Mendocino  CA. ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Summer ,6045,yes
501,Well  I think it was 1977. I was squatting in the woods out by a little lake road of Mendocino  California. I  ve spent most of my life in the woods of California or Maine. Even had resident pet black bears that would come to the open dump at the back of the property. One night  I  m laying in my tent. I don  t remember if it was late (2 am) and I woke up  or if it was earlier in the night (say 11 pm) and I was just going to sleep. Through the woods (about fifty yards away is my guess) the stomping and crashing of smaller trees started going on. It was loud. I was surprised at first and a little afraid because I was squatting illegally on state property. With my familiarity of the noises of the night in the woods  I listened carefully to try to determine or identify what was making the noise. My first assessment was that it was bi-ped ... not a bear or a deer. Realizing this scared me the most. Understanding the force necessary to cause the destructive sounds I was listening to scared me even further. I don  t know if profanity is allowed or acceptable  but i was more effing afraid than I could ever remember  praying that what I was listening to wouldn  t start moving towards my tent. The noise sounded like a two-legged monster crashing through the woods hastily as if trying to make quick time CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH !!! It was then I realized that I heard a dog (or two  I don  t remember) barking in pursuit. Gratefully  the noise was not coming towards me and I suspected that whatever was moving so quickly and violently through the woods was trying to elude the dog(s). I think this whole event lasted about 30 seconds and then the crashing stopped. Then the next scariest thing happened. The dog barked a few more times and then it made that sound dogs make when they are brutally injured. After that  I did not hear a single damned thing except the fear white-noise inside my head. You know ... I worked as a split-maker for a year on LP land in Mendocino County and as a timber operator for about five years east of Fort Bragg and Mendocino. I worked alone very often. I was surprised to read a post on this website wherein the person who wrote it also said they often felt (and somehow knew) they were not alone when in the woods. I would turn off my chainsaw now and then and I could  feel  something watching me. The last strange thing I would share with you about the 22 years of my life 2 - 12 miles east of Fort Bragg in the woods is the frequent discovery of disemboweled animals. Simply that ... disemboweled ... the rest of the animal intact. What an eclectic mix we are in the wonderful County of Mendocino. Please keep as anonymous as possible and do not publish my telephone number. Thank you. Regards to you and yours during this part of the year and the upcoming new year. ********************************************************************** I forgot to follow up on the morning after this encounter. I found what would be considered normal damage made by a large creature thrashing through the woods. No obvious signs that it was or wasn  t Sasquatch. No obvious signs that the dogs had been killed or maimed. I moved my tent to be sure. , ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Unknown ,6045,no
502,It was dinner time and all campers were summoned to the evening meal outside the main lodge approximately 1/4 mile from my tent. I was not able to make it to dinner on time because I had a bloody nose and needed to lay down for a few minutes. After about 5 minutes  I returned to the nearby restroom to clean up and that  s when the incident occurred. What I didn  t see because of high bushes between me and the sound  I did hear very clearly. I heard footsteps in the brush above the restroom. Whatever it was  was moving very slowly. I remember thinking that it was either a person walking very leisurely or something bigger walking at a normal gait. I didn  t quite know what to do so  on an impulse  I made a growling sound. Then the footsteps stopped  but resumed a few seconds later. I repeated the growl and the same thing happened. Since I was alone and frankly a bit nervous since there was not supposed to be anyone else up in the woods with me at that time  I decided to go to dinner. I told some fellow campers about the incident during dinner and they were all a bit skeptical. But after dinner we returned to the area and decided to head toward the exact spot where the footstep sounds were emanating from. I knew before seeing the footprints what I had heard since there had been stories of sightings in the area. The ground was very solid but I managed to make out several manlike footprints in the dirt  only they were much larger. My fellow campers verified what I saw. We decided to try and follow the prints  but since they were so shallow it was difficult to determine the direction the creature had taken. But within a few minutes  our job was made easier because I once again heard the mysterious footstep noise. This time a fellow camper and myself decided to chase the creature making the noise so we took off running in the direction of the noise. After about a minute of running uphill  I brought us to a halt to listen. We now heard the creature running away from us very quickly. We pursued it for a few more minutes  but the only thing we found was one set of toe-prints in the area where the creature had been running from us. Of special note  I do not recall experiencing the bad odor that it supposed to be associated with the Bigfoot creature. ,County of Mendocino near Fort Bragg  CA  USA.

503,In the forest above Noyo Harbor and Dolphin Cove located at Fort Bragg  California. My friend Chris and myself were in Chris  s house which over looks Noyo Bridge and the harbor. Chris came running into the back door of the house and called me  we ran out to the back yard and listened. Chris heard what he thought was a loose cow across the Noyo River. As we listened we heard a creature moving through the forest making very loud crashing sounds. The creature stopped; it was silent for a moment perhaps it saw us watching. Then we heard a grunting sound which became a very low frequency but loud moo  like a cow but deeper in pitch and  much more intense. The creature  s yell went from a  moo  sound to a very high pitch scream unlike any sound I ever heard before or ever will again. After the creature yelled it took off again through the forest heading inland it took only a few seconds and it was to far away to hear the foot steps anymore. This animal sounded like no other and moved fast. Even a cow running through the forest could not make the sounds we heard or cover the same distance as quickly. It was a Big Foot. ,The forest above Noyo Harbor. ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Summer ,6045,no
504,Well it was summer time and I have about 30 acres of land off Highway 101  11 miles north of Laytonville  California. A short distance north is Weott.  I have been a country girl all my life and have spent my life close to the land.  I had always been drawn to the forest and had slept outside when ever possible.  The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property.  This time I wanted to spend the night along the side of the river by the deep pool we always swam in. The river has giant boulders to lay on and bask in the sun.  Both sides of the river are steep one side one side is so steep and gravel like you cant even climb it. Well after much pleading with the people I had brought  they said ok we will camp on the river.  They were drinking a bit much and I was not going to touch it because I was worried they may decide to take a swim and sink.  We had fun with a small campfire we sat and laughed until it was late.  We rolled out our sleeping bags on the bank  the river at our feet and the steep cliff to our heads.  The spot we were in had a bit of a ledge high over our heads.I dont know what time it was when I woke up but I am a light sleeper and I heard the gravel over our heads being walked on. I lay still and listened.  It is moving across the top of the ledge toward my right. There is a deer trial that comes down to creek level about 10 feet away from where I am sleeping and I hear this person coming down it.  I was scared and tried to wake the people closest to me without making to much noise.  Then I kicked the person to my left and he snores louder. To my right  this person (I say person because it was two footed by the sound of it) was no more than 10 feet from me.  It stood behind a willow bush/baby tree it was really just 5 or six canes coming out of the stream bed.  It was dark but I could feel its size when it walked and shook the canes.  I kept thinking I am going to kill these @#% guys  why are they sleeping still? Then the thing started yelling at me.  I know the sound of the animals in the California woods.  I have never heard this in my life.  It was yelling at us  What the hell are you doing hear  this is my place.   It wasn  t like a mountain lion grawling and saying  I  m tough and I can kick your [butt].   It was broken up into batches of sounds with inflections that I recognized. It was like a person speaking another language but you know they are telling you directly to get the hell out of my house. I could see glimpses of it when its body moved into the light of the river.  Its right side was as tall as the canes I knew to be 8 foot-ish.  It ranted and raved and stomped and shook the bush.  I smelled skunk and thought  Great this is all I need  they will bury me without a funeral because I am going to stink.  I finally got my voice and said  Ok Ok its alright ok ok .  I did not see or hear it leave.  But I realized at some point it had left.  My encounter lasted only a few minutes but it felt much longer.  I stayed awake the rest of the night and I was so mad in the morning at my fellow campers.  I do not know if they believed me or not.  I could give a hoot. , ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Summer ,6045,yes
505,I believe this event took place in the late 1970â€™s to the very early 1980â€™s.  My best guess is 1978 or 1979.  My father  mother  younger brother and I were camping in a State Park off of Highway 101  in Mendocino County  CA.  Our parents were in their late thirties  I was 16 or 17 and my brother was 10 or 11.  (Of course these ages are approximate and may have been a year or two less or more).  We also had our dog with us  a 60-pound Black Lab - Dalmatian mix.  It was late July to early September and very likely Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day. The park in situated on both sides of the Eel River  and is for the most part second growth or new growth Redwood forest mixed with other trees and brush of the area.  The main section of the park is next to Highway 101. The far side of the park  away from the highway and across the river  is only open from the end of May to the middle of September.  The rest of the year the access bridge is removed and stowed above the high water line. The far side of the park has more foliage and is frequented by bear  deer  raccoon  skunks and other animals.  We were camping on the far side of the park as far up the hill as possible. I believe this event occurred toward Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day for the following reasons; we had something of a ritual in making a final â€œend of the Summerâ€ trip to this park  the park was very quiet meaning other campers had made an early start home to avoid holiday traffic or were not there at all being the weekend after Labor Day  and on this particular morning my father stayed in camp to do some paper work.  He was a high school math teacher so he usually did lesson plans or other work only in the late summer. Mom  my brother  the dog and I decided to take a short hike up a trail on the edge of the campground.  The trail worked its way up over the crest of the hills for about two miles and ended above a barn and farm located in a clearing at the bottom of the other side of the hills.  The trail is mainly up hill  makes several cut backs  and passes across two or three unpaved fire roads.  It was a clear sunny day and there was no one else out on the trail. Our dog liked to take the point position to see the animals ahead.  She was an avid hunter of rabbits and liked to chase deer.  I had often seen her race after deer  taking dangerous inclines and thick brush at full speed.  On this day I do not recall her scaring up anything to chase.  The three of us talked as we went up the trail.  During the last half mile to quarter mile of the trail my mother gave us a serious order to stop. We paused while she looked and listened to an area behind us to our left.  She asked if we heard any thing  but I do not recall if my brother or I did. We walked on  more slowly now  listening to the forest.  After about 50 yards we felt like we could hear something moving in the woods  behind us to our left  and once again stopped.  The noise stopped when we stopped.  This time we indicated that we did hear it.  The dog was in the middle of the trail listening as well but did not go into the brush to investigate.  We continued on now for another 50-100 yards and we were almost to the crest and the vista area.  Again we thought we heard the noise paralleling us to our left but were not 100% sure.  We all stopped again.  Before we could again acknowledge the sound  there was a loud wooden knocking noise off to our right.  It was 3-4 quick â€œknock - knock - knock â€“ knockâ€.  Initially I thought it was two tree trunks rubbing together in the wind.  I looked up to see if I could see anything  but there was no breeze.  Before I could look back down  there was a loud forceful huffing of air coming from the bottom of the tree.  It was something like a growl but not quite.  It was low and guttural  and was a rapid exhalation of air from a very large animal. Whatever it was  that was enough for us.  It was my mother who spun around and said  â€œLetâ€™s go.â€  No one disagreed and we turned and sprinted all the way back to camp.  I think we covered the two miles without a stop.  Instead of taking the lead  the dog took up the rear position  which in my momâ€™s opinion was meant to protect us from whatever was behind us.  This was the first and only time we heard anything like that and was the only time we have ever even contemplated running in fear during a hike.  I do not recall any smell in the area. The incident has never felt right to me and I have thought back to it on several occasions.  My mother has always thought that a bear was stalking us.  (She has always had a very strong apprehension of bears  and always warned us not to get between a cub and its mother  or try to feed a bear or approach any bear.  Nonetheless  we have chased them away on more than one occasion.).  I have heard of stalking behavior in bears before  but only in grizzlies  browns and polar bears â€“ not in the California black bears.  Additionally  the behavior of the animal did not seem like a bear either  and did not elicit the response from our dog that I would have expected for a bear. I discovered this site about 12 months ago and the similarities of otherâ€™s reports with my incident made me think that this was a bigfoot.  Assuming the accuracy of otherâ€™s stories  it seems to be a more plausible explanation than being followed by a bear as well  as a better fit with the facts.  I spoke to my mother recently about it and she still felt it was a bear  besides she said  â€œBigfoot are only up in the Pacific Northwest.â€  I separately spoke to my father about this site and he thought I was pulling his leg.  After I told him that I believed the stories were sincere  and told him some of the common details of the events  he immediately brought up that time â€œyou guys came running down from the trail.â€ I did not send this sooner because it is a class B and twenty plus years old already.  I have heard a couple of stories regarding other incidents  but none that I have first or second hand knowledge of. What may be of interest is that I have seen a nest like the one in Report 2928.  I cannot recall exactly where I saw it but it was within the last 5 years.  It was some where in the Sierras  and I think it was in the Mammoth Lakes area.  I recall being off trail  cutting between lakes  or trying to relocate a trail when I saw it.  In any case it was well off the trail and quite a way from the town or trailhead.  Thinking it was a humanâ€™s hand made shelter  I was surprised at the amount of effort that must have went into building the little A frame.  It was tucked in between some tree trunks and the roof was a tight thatch of broken limbs.  It just struck me that a tent would have been easier to move and set up  and would have afforded better protection overall.  I glanced around but did not see any garbage or clothes or other signs of a camp.  There was no smell that I recall.  I was also surprised at how far away the nest was from the town â€“ whoever this belonged to was trying to stay well away from the trail and others.  I guessed that it must belong to someone that really wanted to be left alone  so I went on my way. ,Standish - Hickey State Park.

506,Last night  Jan.16 2005  I took my dog outside for a little walk. We live on 2 acres in Redwood Valley  CA.  It was dark and about 6 00 with a mod. overcast sky  the moon peeking through the clouds. We have a small dog that will usually bark in response to any other dog barking in our area.  Houses are well-spaced on our rolling hillside that  s covered with a mix of oak and pines. From Hwy. 101 looking west  you see very few houses on our hillside. Anyway  as I was walking I could hear this very unusual  animal  sound unlike any I  ve heard before. It was NOT a dog howling and I  m not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds   would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he  s inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was   Anyway  it  s on the other side of that hill.  I said   It  s not a dog  and our dog is not barking at it.   He agreed it was strange but wasn  t concerned. Soon thereafter  a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn  t hear it again. This is not the first time we  ve heard  unusual sounds that we can  t identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can  t connect with any animal I  m familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating  Big Foot  sounds that they  d heard on the internet . It was about 11 00 at night when they were fooling around   loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1 00 AM  that same night  we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden   water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off  and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he  d been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making. Anyway  here  s a synopsis of a few incidents. We decided to post these after last nights occurrence of the strange  unidentifiable call. , ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Winter ,6045,no
507,This past Sunday  5/23/04 at 10 30 am  we found strange foot prints in the muddy parts in the road along Murry Range  Covelo CA. The print did not resemble bear tracks. These tracks where longer and had no claw imprints in the mud. After taking pictures of several different foot prints with a tape measurer  we started to look around for other sign. We did not see any thing but more foot prints and a smaller version of the foot print. ,North of Hwy 162 on Murry Range on the lower road.

508,Re  Our Bigfoot encounter in California My wife and I have had two incidents over the year  including vocalization and wood knocking. We are San Francisco City people  artist; not hunters. We are not used to the outdoors or accustom to the forest and nature and the shock of fresh clean air. The first encounter was on Tuesday evening  8/16/05 at 5 17pm on highway 128 in the Redwood forest. We were on a vacation  driving west on 128 and heading towards Fort Bragg  CA. Once we entered the state park  we stopped and parked to smell the fresh air. I marked the time  because I was shooting with my digital camera. We walked into the forest  on a trail  and were having a great time  enjoying our time alone. There was little traffic or noise from the road. The forest was quiet and powerful. We have lived in the center of San Francisco for 15 years  and were stunned and amazed to experience the silence and peace of the Redwoods. As we got deeper into the woods  about 20 minutes  I started to get uneasy; feeling like someone was watching us. The digital photos my wife took of me show my concern  the longer we stayed. Then we heard it.  It was a growl-grunting. Just above the hearing of my ears. I would described it as â€œinfra-soundâ€- a deep sound that was low in pitch  deep  almost inaudible. My body felt it more than my ears. It threw me in a panic. The fear in me rose fast. I looked at my wife and she was feeling the panic. We both looked around. We could not tell the direction. We could not see anything in the thick woods around us. It could have been a bear or a wolf. But my instincts said no. I did not know what it was. But  the  vibe  message was becoming clear- GO AWAY NOW! Predators do not warn-they ambush-right? My wife looked at me and said â€œDid you hear that?â€ I said â€œYesâ€. She said  â€œLetâ€™s get back to the carâ€. I said â€œGood idea!â€  It was a weird feeling. We were stunned and mystified as we ran back to the car. We drove away nervous and excited about what happened. On our way to Fort Bragg  CA  we were talking about the experience. Was it a bigfoot? Did we have a Bigfoot encounter? We felt something special had just happened. We had to learn more about bigfoots. Over the year  I became obsessed with bigfoots. I read as mush as I could about the Sasquatch  Yeren  Almasty  and Yeti as my time permit. My wife became obsessed also. Together we decided to go back to those redwoods and try to make contact with the forest giants. We made it back to highway 128 on Monday 9/4/06. Something told me to pull over at a different spot. As soon as I got out  I had the DV video camera running. On the camera my wife tells me to make my â€œWhoop-Whoopâ€ Bigfoot call  into the redwood forest. As soon as I did  the camera records wood knocking and tree breaking. Soon the smell of a dead animal/skunk filled the air. The sounds and smells go on for about three minutes   then stops. I could tell he moved away after my calls to him  inviting him to be photographed. We left the redwood forest  excited about our contact. My wife wants to see a bigfoot. I do not want to see him.  I hear that many people die or have very bad luck after seeing a Bigfoot. Remember Dr. Morbius from the movie Forbidden Planet? Maybe Bigfoot is the ID  coagulated from the quantum soup of our collective unconscious mind. Maybe  Bigfoot is us. , ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Fall ,6045,yes
509,Id like to do it this way  still not sure exactly what happened. Im with a paranormal invest group  earlier this monthwe went to Round Valley (Covelo) In calif. One of the investigations was a night time walk up a hill at a rancher  s property in Covelo; earlier in the week  from what I remember hearing  was a Bigfoot had been interacting twice with his horses  which he chased off  so we hit that spot. Except me  I stayed in the car with a video game and a flashlight onhand. Maybe 10-15 mins after everyone else took off up the hill  I noticed a movement by the rear passenger window at the driver  s side of the car  something a gold-tan color was standing by the back window. Turned off the interior light in the car and sat in the dark a little while  maybe 4-5 mins  then turned it back on. Whatever it was came back to the window again; this time I heard what I guess has to be described as   patting/palming   the door of the car. I about lost it then  ( I dont scare  so this is really strange)  and turned off the light  didnt turn it back on till everyone else came back down the hill. Just before people returned  I saw something run past the car really fast  up toward the front of the car line ( we had 4 cars there  I was in the last one). No one else saw the running whatever  they checked the door but didnt see any muddy handprints or anything on it. Im still frazzled  been dealing with all types of wild animals  since I was a kid ( aunt worked witha  zoo and Ive done wildlife rehab since I was a kid). Heard from someone in town there that BF  s have a way of sort of mentally   fear-paralyzing   animals; this sort of explains why I tried to turn myself into a tall thin stick when I was sitting there. Any ideas? Im stumped. ,Was on a Covelo residents property  up a hill  he had 2 horses. Not sure where it was exactly  we were asked to go there to look over this. Please dont list this  Im still not sure what happened yet. ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Winter ,6045,yes
510,On my way north on Highway 101 about 11 miles north of Willits I observed a very large creature jump up onto the roadway  and bound across three lanes   while slowing my car down to approx. 20 mph  when it ran directly in front of my vehicle and jumped down into the ditch and then shot up a steep hillside. I got a very good look at this thing and I know that it was about 7 feet tall   had a black wool covering the whole body with a face like untanned leather  almost yellow. It looked like it was running on the hind legs and was using its massive arms leaning forward  to pull itself along. The head was really round and the wool covered the ears completly. This animal was on a mission to cross that freeway and I would have hit it if I hadn  t slowed down ,approx. 1 mile north of beginning of four lane and parallel to outlet Creek ,Mendocino,14,California ,CA,Summer ,6045,yes
511,I think it was 1992 when this happened. The only people I told were my dad and uncle who were deer hunting with me at the time. I had left our camp before sunrise so I would be deep into the woods when the sun came up. I had just come out of the tree line into a clearing when I got a feeling something was watching me  I thought it was probably just deer but as I went across the clearing out into the open I felt really strange like something just glaring at me. I walked east into the sun and wind to the edge of the bank where there was still paches of snow on the ground because this was early October in X3B deer hunting zone. That  s when I saw half a foot print in the snow.  It looked like the heal of a human foot only this one was about 8 inches wide. Then around 6 feet towards the edge of the bank was the front half of another print with five toes only they were big around like a man  s bare foot would have been after the snow melted around it  but they were not from a man and the tracks were fresh. I looked over the edge of the bank and the side was all flat rock shail that looked like it had been recently disturbed. About 100 yards down was thick timber and as I looked down into it I felt like something was looking right up at me. I felt chills big time right then and felt like I needed to get away from there. Thats all that happend but I really think there was something down there that either saw me or heard me at least half a mile away because I was hunting with the wind in my face. ,Go east from Alturas on 395 turn right at Davis Creek  turn left when the dirt roads cross  about five miles north on that road start walking east till you reach the top and can see the feilds of Nevada. ,Modoc,3,California ,CA,Winter ,6049,yes
512,I heard a very strange  and very eery (stand your hair on end) kind of  howl . I know it was no coyote  wolf or mountain lion as some would like to convince me of. Just what it was I don  t know but I know it was not very far away from me. I couldn  t see what it was or exactly where it was. I live in Alturas  Ca. I have no idea exactly what I  m supposed to put in this report but I  ve not heard this  howl  again. When I heard this  I was going down to close my gate. My dog (pit bull) came with me as always but stopped about half way down the hill. I called him but when we heard this  howl  for the second time he turned and ran to the house and when I got back up the hill  he was as far back in his dog house as he could get. This is strange for him as he thinks he is the worst thing in the community and really not afraid of anything. I don  t know what else to tell you except it was really an eery kind of howl and not anything like I  ve ever heard before. We have a lot of dogs in this part of Modoc Estates and at that particular time  not even one was barking like usual. , ,Modoc,3,California ,CA,Spring ,6049,no
513,This happened about 24 years ago  but it is still fresh in my mind (I guess you never really forget these type of experiences). It was late July of 1977. My family was up in the eastern Sierras  near Mono Lake  approx 13-15 miles above Conway Summit in an area known as Virginia Lakes. My dad told my brother and I to go to the lake and gather firewood. It was late in the day and the sun was down but it wasn  t dark yet  only dusk. I was 14 yrs old and my brother was 1 month shy of 16. He had his learners permit so we were allowed to take the truck. We got to the lake and started loading up some wood. I had just returned to the truck and dropped the wood when I heard  what I thought  was someone walking through the brush. The foot falls were very heavy  almost like someone was jumping  but the steps seemed pretty rapidly placed. Where we were gathering wood was near a large hedge of bushes  approx 6 to 7 feet high and very dense with only 1 path through the bush to skirt the lake without wading in the water. I turned to the bushes  where the sound was coming from  and saw the bushes shaking and bending  as if something large was moving through the bushes  making a lot of noise. I watched for a few seconds when my brother came running to the truck  white as a ghost and eyes bulging wide. I said  Jeff  what was that?  He was scared and out of breath.  I don  t know  but let  s get out of here.  he said. We jumped back into the truck and drove all out. On the way back to the camp  he told me that he was only 10 or 15 feet away from it. He heard the stomping and crashing of the brush  and turned to see a large  dark-brown head above the bushes moving rapidly away from him. He didn  t see the face. He was so scared  he crashed the truck into a tree on the way back to camp. My dad was pretty pissed  to say the least  and didn  t believe our story  even when we were crying because of how frightened we were. He finally calmed down and said that we probably saw a bear. But  bears do not walk through heavy brush on 2 legs. And my brother swore that it was not a bear. I think my dad started to believe that we saw something since we both would not go out to the camp fire that night  and both of us refused to go to the lake alone for the rest of the trip. Since that time  I have told several people with very few people actually believing me. Most told me that big foot are only in the north-west in Oregan/Washington. But  after finding this website  I feel a bit vindicated. ,Traveling north on Hwy 395  as you crest Conway Summit  there is a left turn to Virginia lakes. The lakes are at an elevation of approx 9500 ft. The sighting was at Lower Virginia Lake near the road. I haven  t been back to this area since the mid 80  s so I don  t know how much has changed. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Summer ,6051,yes

515,I was in Mammoth Lakes  Ca. on a weekend trip playing softball. It was a Sunday night. My roommate  my brother and myself were the only ones to stay that night. It was around 1 30 in the morning  when my dog woke me up. She was whining and pacing in the tent. I was trying to calm her down when I heard this sound. I am a serious bigfoot believer and visit the BFRO site often. The sound I heard  which I recognized immediately  was exactly like the HOWL recordings on the BFRO website. When I heard this howl  I instantly sat up. I listened for about 20 or 30 seconds when my brother suddenly sat up and said  what the hell is that? . I said I wasn  t sure because I didn  t want to sound crazy by saying it was bigfoot. The howl went on for another minute or so. When it was over  my brother said  I have never heard a noise like that. What was that?  That  s when I told him I think we just heard bigfoot. I have since played the recording of the HOWL back to my brother  and he agrees that is what we heard. My roommate never woke up so he never heard it. The entire time the howl was going on  my dog was really freaking out. I know in my heart  I heard bigfoot that night. ,As you get off highway 395 to go to Mammoth Lakes  you will come to a stop light. Right before the stoplight  there is a campground on the right called Shady Rest Campground. We were in the group campground area. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Spring ,6051,no
516,just a note re  Report # 2942  (Class B) Submitted by witness J.B. on Sunday  August 05  2001.... I was in the area north of mammoth during that same week...maybe 10 miles north of the reports location.... I have been visiting a fly fishing location on the Owens river for five years in a row during the first week of may in the same location...kinda midway between mammoth and june lakes.   My friend and I heard 3 very loud...very long screams on the night of the 3rd of may... We were backing in my truck to get loaded up to go home the next day...as we backed in next to the cabin  we suddenly heard a terrifying scream about 10 seconds in duration...It sounded like it was right behind the truck..and we had the windows all closed....We just sat there and were saying to eachother  what the f**k was that????  We thought we ran over a deer or something big...I immediately turned the truck around and hit the high beams...nothing there so we opened the windows a few inches and just then another scream...this time it sounded off my side of the truck and a bit further away...maybe 20 or 30 yards....once again about 30 secs later one more scream a little shorter this time and further away...it was definitely moving away from us... At this point we saw some people in a cabin about 200 yards away shining flashlights up and down the mountainside (I questioned one of the ppl in that cabin at 7 am next morning outside as he passed our cabin but he denied hearing anything at all that last night...I KNOW...VERY STRANGE...) i recall him saying it was probably a rabbit...i have heard rabbit screams when they get bitten and it was not that for sure...too loud and long anyway.. Needless to say we were freaked out pretty badly and took 10 minutes or so to get up the (courage) to go into the cabin...hate to admit it but we moved tables against the doors that night....and i moved my bed away from the window to the middle of the room...... Didn  t know if i was ever gonna post this but after reading the class B report that occurred during the same week really close by...I didnt know that there were any sightings so far south...... I do have some lingering doubts however that what we heard may have been a mountain lion maybe???  (a link to normal wildlife sounds would be great to at least rule out the possibilities of other noises)    The sound was VERY similar to the ohio bigfoot screams but higher in pitch and what i would call  angrier  sounding.....it was a very threatening sound.... ,Exact location withheld for privacy reasons. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Spring ,6051,no
517,We (my husband  my son  and myself) were in Mono County this past weekend  Sunday August 21st  2005  for a day hike to Roosevelt Lake and its twin.  We arrived at the lakes at appx. 11 a.m. and fished until 2 30 p.m.  at which time we decided to head back down the trail for home.  There were quite a few hikers in the area over the course of the day  appx. 13 hikers and a pack train consisting of 4 riders and 8 horses and a dog. Some coming in  some going out.  Anyway  we headed down the trail following the pack train.  We stopped on the way down to read the sign about the wagons that tried to use that trail way back in the day. I heard a noise like some one else coming down the trail behind us and told my family let  s get going.  The trail was pretty dry and dusty and my husband kept insisting that we give the hikers ahead of us some time so we could avoid walking in their dust. The next section of trail was slightly up hill so after cresting the top and going a short distance down the other side we stopped for a water break.  We heard what we thought was a shout  my son shouted back and something answered  but the echo was pretty bad  so we couldn  t make out what was being said.  We continued on down the trail and had just approached the south end of Leavitt Meadows  when my husband says  What is that?   Both my son and I stopped and looked across the river toward the meadow.  From the beginning it was a strange sight  because this large black thing appeared to be floating across the meadow.  At first I thought it was a backpacker perhaps riding a bike  because it was moving so quickly across the meadow. It was moving quickly and smoothly.  It didn  t make sense.  If it was a back packer  to be moving that fast  he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike  then why couldn  t I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body  not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something.  Also the color  I couldn  t figure out why a backpacker would be wearing black  black cap  black backpack  black pants  black coat.  It was at least 80-85 degrees.  We stood and watched silently for a time  perhaps 10-15 seconds.  The speed and smoothness with which it traveled was mesmerising.  Then my husband and son took off running further up the trail to another vantage point; they continued to watch it silently  then just shortly after I caught up to them  my son yelled  and the thing stopped and turned toward us.  It didn  t turn as a human would turn  even one wearing a backpack.  Then it began moving across the meadow again.  Not faster or slower  just the same floating type pace. We were on the trail above the meadow  looking down and appx. 500-800 yards a way from the object.  My husband believes the thing was following the pack trail. We left the trail and went down to the meadow.  We stayed on the trail side of the river.  The thing was on the opposite side of the river.  By this time it was gone or hidden from us.  The best way to describe it is like this.  The thing had a head that sat directly on its shoulders.  It did not appear to have a neck.  That is why we at first thought it was a backpacker.  It went head  broad shoulders or backpack  no neck  large body.  We could not discern its legs or arms due mostly to the angle at which it was leaving us. The grass in the Meadow obscured some of the legs. We have spent many hours in the woods  my husband was raised in Plumas county  neither he nor I have ever ever seen anything like this.  It could not have been a bear  they can  t walk that far on 2 legs  nor that smoothly or quickly. ,The trail goes into the Hoover Wilderness beginning at Leavitt Meadows Camp Ground.  South end of the meadow. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Summer ,6051,yes
518,I was living up in Mammoth Lakes  on this weekend I decided to go to Laurel Canyon to do some fishing and exploring. This area is not easily accessible because of the terrain and the road being obstructed by snow in some areas.  As I was coming back down the canyon I came to an open spot along the side of the mountain heading into a more wooded area next to a meadow. The meadow was about 300 yards away.  I was looking ahead of meyself at the beginning of the wooded area  when I saw a human like creature cross the road heading towards the meadow. Its gait was very unhuman like bent at the waist and  arms swinging like you might see a vaudeville actor do at the end of a show as they exit the stage  a bit looney tunes like. I observed it for about 3 to 4 strides. It was all black  long arms (longer than ours)  tall  muscular  and slim with no neck visible. It must of been at least 7 to 8 ft. tall and weighing about 400 to 500 lbs. I reached for my camera and that is when I saw it cross back over the road again this time in a slow more human like gait like it was trying to elude something without illiciting a chase response from whatever it was trying to elude like you might do if you saw a growling dog. ,[Location specifics removed at the request of the witness.] ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Spring ,6051,yes
519,I used to live in Bishop  CA on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  I have spent lots of time camping  hiking  fishing  and skiing in the Sierra backcountry.  I am familiar with many kinds of animal sounds and signs in the mountains. Last weekend  we were camping at the Sawmill Walk-in Campground on the east side of Yosemite National Park.  After sunset as dusk was deepening  we were sitting around our camp table talking.  From the direction of the forests that line the canyon floor towards Mt. Conness in the west  a series of whoop-howls rang out from the distance and rolled down the canyon.  My sister was talking and immediately stopped  turned around  and said   What is that?!   The calls continued for a few moments and then ceased.  They sounded most similar to the Snohomish and Puyallup calls on the BFRO website.  When the calls started  all other normal background wildlife noise stopped and didn  t resume until several seconds after the calls ceased.  There were no answers to the original call  nor did it repeat. That area of Yosemite is relatively deserted  and the Sawmill Walk-in Campground only has a few sites that are scattered widely.  The trail that runs through the campground eventually leads to the top of Mt. Conness and branches into the back country.  I have never had an experience like this before  but hope I one day have the opportunity to have a visual encounter with one of these animals. ,Driving from east to west  one gets on CA Hwy 120 off of I-395 just south of Lee Vining and the road rises steeply towards Yosemite National Park.  After passing lake Ellery on the left  one comes to a right turn at the Saddlebag Lake road.  Following this dirt road for 1.5 miles  one comes to the Sawmill walk-in campground.  We were in site #5. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Summer ,6051,no
520,Two years ago  I went with my Uncle to stay at a cabin in Mammoth Lakes to hike  fish  and just enjoy the nature.  We had a cabin right on the border of Lake Mary and he had brought his two sheep dogs with him to the cabin. Every night he and I would take turns taking the dogs out for a walk. We would bring a flash light with us each time we went out to walk the dogs. One night when I was walking the dogs  one of them started growling and I listened closely and could hear the rustling of fallen leaves and the breaking of small branches. I shined my light right at where I heard the sounds. Now both of the dogs were growling and pulling at the leash trying to get at whatever was in the forest. I looked around closely with the flashlight and then I saw something. A huge figure about 200 feet away from me was watching me and the dogs. It was kind of swaying between the trees and just staring right at me and the dogs. It looked like a very tall ape  but it looked more built like a human. I was scared stiff and I must have stood there for a minute or two holding the dogs back and staring at the creature when it turned around and started walking away. I then walked very fast back to the cabin watching the woods and not stopping for anything. I have never spoken of this incident with anyone before in my life and I have recently heard about this sight and thought it was finally time to talk about this with someone who would understand. ,Lake Mary Rd. that goes to Lake Mary ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Summer ,6051,no
521,When I was very young I saw a pair of Bigfoot tracks with my father. Iâ€™m guessing I was about 9 years old. Iâ€™m now 22. My father and I used to go rabbit hunting all the time. We always went to the same place and always saw dozens and dozens of rabbits. We would get up very early in the morning  about 1AM  so that we could get out to our spot about an hour before dawn. So it was a few hours outside of Bishop  CA. We would make sure to get there early so that we could sit in the car and wait for dawn to come. Just as the sun would start to rise and there was enough light to see we would normally see tons of rabbits running about  but that day was different. There was not a single rabbit in sight. That had never happened before. We stayed in the truck and waited until the sun was fully up before we decided to get out and take a stroll around to see if there was anything to see. Just before we left the truck my dad asked me if I wanted to bring the camera and I told him  Na  we arenâ€™t going to see anything out here.  Ha-ha! Boy was I mistaken. We took off from the truck and went into the wilderness. There was nothing to see at all. No animals anywhere. We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand. There were two sets of prints  one right next to the other. They were barefoot and looked just like human feet. Right away we knew what they were. Itâ€™s a natural thing that goes through your mind. When you see them you say yourself   Those are bigfoot tracks.  The first sets of tracks were HUGE  and thee times as big as my fathers feet  and he is about 6   3  with a good sized foot. (He is very thin though). The second set of footprints was the same size as mine. Right next to its parents tracks. The tracks dug deep into the ground and my father and I talked about that. We tried to stomp on the ground to see if we make an indention as deep as theirs but we couldnâ€™t  even with our shoes on. We followed the tracks and we came to a barbwire fence. On the other side was a paved road. On the other side of the road was a hill that went up and overlooked a valley. I was too young to notice anything about how the tracks crossed the fence and got to the road or if there was a piece of fur on the barbs  so Iâ€™m sorry that I couldnâ€™t tell you anymore about that. On the other side of the road there were no tracks and we couldnâ€™t find any more around. My father decided that we needed the camera  so I stayed at the fence while he went back the way we came to get back to the truck. It seemed like it took forever for him to return and being a little kid I was getting a little scared. But  he finally came back and told me that he could not find the truck! So when we were done looking around we took the road that we had found to see where it would lead us. It took us to a small town that we had passed to get to our spot. So we knew where we were form there and were able to finally get back to our truck and once we were there we decided we had gotten enough walking done for the day so we headed home. ,After some questioning  it was determined that these two hunters went north from Bishop  Ca. on Hwy. 6  and then went a short ways west on Hwy. 120. There they reached a very small town site  determined to be Benton Hot Springs  where there they went south a little ways. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Summer ,6051,yes
522,On May 18  1991  while on vacation in the Mammoth Lakes area in Northern California  my family took a short day hike to Mono Lake to do some sightseeing. It was overcast and very cold with a strong wind blowing. There was still snow on the surrounding peaks. Mono Lake is at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. I do not recall the location at which we parked the car to begin our hike  but I do remember that ours was the only car in the parking area and that the spot was quite desolate. It was a cold Saturday morning and the area was deserted. At 9 17AM I began shooting VHS video footage of our trek  and after a short period of time we finally decided to leave because of the wind and cold. We went back to our hotel in June Lake  enjoyed the rest of the weekend and went home. The trip was quite uneventful (or so we assumed). The tape went into our family home video collection and for 17 years  from 1991 to 2008  it has been watched countless times by family and friends. So much so that my kids have the dialog on much of the tape collection memorized. On April 19  2008 my daughter (6 years old in the video and now 22) was watching the tape in the downstairs family room when she suddenly screamed out and began yelling for me to come downstairs. I thought something bad had happened and after racing down the staircase  found my daughter and my ex sitting in front of the television telling me to watch a segment from the tape. What I saw when we played it back made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. And it was something none of us had ever noticed in almost 17 years of watching this tape  In the final few seconds of the Mono Lake segment just before I turned the camera off I caught something very large and black moving between two rock formations a short distance from where we had been hiking. It was completely black with no differentiation in color or texture and walked upright like a human but with a gate more like a primate. At first I thought it was a bear  but after going over the video many times and finally digitizing and sharpening it I am now unsure what to think. From examination of the footage of my family whose distance from the camera was comparable to that of the creature it is easy to see the distinct details and variation in clothing  hair  face and hands. In contrast  the creature caught on tape exhibits none of those distinctions.The shape of the body does not resemble a human. The head is too large and the arms are too long. And although it does resemble a bear at one particular angle in the clip  the stance and gate don  t add up. It is an intriguing mystery. That we were able to go for 17 years without noticing this event on the tape seems unbelievable  but in retrospect it actually makes some sense. The segment lasts for only a couple of seconds and the focus is on the lake and mountains which is what I must have been filming at the time. I didn  t see it when I shot the tape and it has since gone unnoticed because one must really be looking for it to see it. I am not a person who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories  alien abductions and bizarre events such as a purported Bigfoot sighting. I  ve seen various footage and photographs of Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings over the years and have always been extremely skeptical of their authenticity. As an engineer who now teaches high school physics  I am highly educated and very level headed. If I see something I don  t understand my natural reaction is to analyze it rationally using the scientific method. I do not jump to conclusions based on faulty hypotheses. So in this case  I will suspend judgment pursuant to further investigation. But having shown this video to family and friends whose opinions I trust  the overall reaction seems to be a unanimous  Bigfoot!!  Wishful thinking? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way it is very intriguing and definitely warrants further investigation. Your opinion and assistance in this matter would be appreciated. ,Maybe 20 yards from the waters edge on a section of beach at Mono Lake. Unclear on the exact location; however  that should be easy to ascertain from the terrain captured on the video tape. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Spring ,6051,yes
523,I was driving back to Los Angeles from our second home in Mammoth.  I left very early  around 2 30 AM  as it is a long drive back to town  and I wanted to beat the traffic.  I left the house and was driving out of the complex.  The Snowcreek Golf Course  is on the left side of the road  and a field is on the right.  The road has a few curves in it. As I was coming around a curve  my headlights were shining into the field  and I saw a large figure walking  probably at least one hundred yards away.  I noticed that the figure seemed really large for being that far away from me.  It had a very definite stride  with its arms extended out in front  rotating from front to back.  It was traveling through the field at a good pace.  I thought gee  that  s a really big guy walking  what is he doing out here so early in the morning  in that cold  dark field.  He didn  t even turn his head with the headlights beaming in his direction  like it didn  t bother him a bit.  He just kept walking towards town. I am not necessarily sold on the whole Bigfoot thing  but what I saw was pretty strange. , ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Fall ,6051,yes
524,I have spoken verbally with an investigator about this incident  but never filled out a report. The more I think about it  the more relevant it seems. So this is my report  I had been camping on family property for two days waiting for others to arrive. This property once had a cabin on it that was destroyed in the late sixties by an avalanche  but the concrete slab is still there  and we park RV  s on it. I had been sitting in a folding chair reading for a couple of hours when I heard a very large branch snap. It was loud like a gunshot  or at least seemed that way with all of the quiet. Immediately after the snap there was a commotion as some of my nearby items (gas cans and trailer dolly) fell from their spot behind an old wooden shed about 35 feet from me  and something very large moved through the trees for about 30 feet and stopped. As soon as the branch snapped  I shot out of my chair and then heard the rest of the commotion. It really scared me  and I looked around for the dogs. They were cowering at the door to the trailer  which is strange because they usually go after anything out there. I wanted in the trailer just as bad as they did. As I approached the door  I got the feeling that the animal in question was a short distance away watching. It was very unnerving. We went in and locked the door. ,Lundy Lake area ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Fall ,6051,yes
525,A week ago my family and I went on a vacation to the Double Eagle Resort and Spa in June Lake  California. We stayed at one of the furthest cabins at the resort  which backed up to a forest at the bottom of granite rock formations. These rock formations separated the Inyo National Forest from the town of June Lake. The first night we stayed at the resort  June 30  2010  my brother  my father and I were watching TV in the front of the cabin and at around 11 30pm we went out on our deck to look out at the amazing view we had. Within five minutes the silence was broken when we heard a howl in the distance  which sounded like it was coming from the granite formations  which over looked the resort. All of us froze. The sound scared us because we had never heard a sound like that before. The vocalization lasted under a minute. We waited for another 10-15 minutes out on the deck to see if whatever made the howl would howl again. But it did not howl again so we went back inside and I took a shower. While I was showering my brother and father continued to watch TV  but this time they opened up all the windows in the cabin to see if they could hear the howling again. When I got out of the shower ten minutes later  my brother and father told me they heard the same sound again when I was in the shower and this time my mother who was in bed with her window open heard the howling too. This time there were three howls  which were all shorter than the first howl we heard on the deck and there was only about 20 seconds in between each howl. My family and I stayed there another night but did not hear any more howls. ,The location of the howl was near the Double Eagle Resort and Spa located South of Lee Vining and Mono Lake off HWY 158  which is a two-lane road  which makes a C connecting back to HWY 395. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Summer ,6051,no
526,9--30-15 we were camping at Virginia Lakes. We had killed a deer and had the carcass out back of camp. during the night about 2 a.m. my son  daughter-in-law and my grandson first heard sounds of rocks or big stones being thrown or dropped. Then they started hearing knocking noises like someone hitting trees with a bat followed by a low growl ending in a high pitched scream. This went on for about 15 min. At this time I was awakened by a a noise. I wasn  t sure what it was and I thought a bear was after the deer. I jumped up and my son said something was screaming outside. I ran out with a flash light and could see nothing.  I was looking for a bear or eye shine  I got one single eyeshine about 7 or 8 ft off the ground when I panned back it was gone. I thought maybe a raccoon. But when the family told me what they heard I knew it was not a coon and tried to make them think it was a bear. The next morning when I went to check nothing had been touched but a very large pine tree next to the deer had been pushed nearly completely over. I have been an hunter and outdoors man all my life but have no answer for this. Just thought you would like to know because it happened so recently ,Virginia Lakes Rd. ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Fall ,6051,yes
527,I went to Mono Lake with my father early in the morning to capture some long exposure photos of the sunrise. We arrived at the lake around 6 AM right at golden hour. When we got to the parking lol there was one other car parked in the lot. After grabbing my photography gear (camera bag/tripod) we began walking down the path towards the lake. I was looking off to my right hand side and clearly saw something that was all black and bipedal walking parallel with me about 15 yards away. It ducked behind a small tufa as I was watching it walk. I told my dad that I saw something walking on 2 feet and he said that he saw something moving over in that direction as well. I knew that there was a person in the same area as us since there was a car parked in the lot when we arrived so there was still a possibility that what I saw was a person dressed in all black  although it would be strange for a person to be walking off the path in the area where I saw this thing since we were still away from the lake where all of the points of interest are. My dad and I continued to walk towards the lake to shoot the sunrise. As we approached the lake there was another photographer who had their camera mounted on their tripod and was taking photos. At this point I realized that what I saw walking was not a person since the owner of the car who was parked when we arrived had just been accounted for. I did not think I would ever experience something like this in my lifetime. I wish I would have gone to the area where I saw it and looked for some evidence or footprints but I was too scared to stray off the path since it was able to disappear in the brush / tufas so easily. ,Mono Lake ,Mono,16,California ,CA,Summer ,6051,yes
528,We were on a family hike in the Ventana Wilderness area  south West of the dam.  We had been climbing pretty steadily and were walking along a ridgeline  next to a densely forested downhill.  My sixteen year old son was leading  about 20 yds ahead.  I heard him let out a scream and immediately ran to see what was wrong. I heard a large animal crashing down the hill to my right and caught a glimpse of a dark object which quickly disappeared into the vegetation.  Note at this time  my son was about 74 inches and 190 lbs.  I turned to him and asked  What was it?   His reply was  I don  t know.   He and I stood there and discussed it for a while.  As he was walking up the trail he heard a rushing sound like something running toward him.  He glanced to his right and saw an animal running directly toward him. At this point he screamed. In his words it was bigger than he was and ran right past him on two legs and proceeded down the hill.  As I said  I caught a fleeting glimpse of part of something dark. His description was of a bipedal creature  covered in hair clearly over 6 ft tall and weighing more than 190 lbs. , ,Monterey,4,California ,CA,Summer ,6053,yes
529,This incident took place early April 1993. I was working for the US Forest Service on the Monterey Ranger District (Arroyo Seco Station). One the first things we had to do before the day began was go on a 2-mile fitness run. I donâ€™t remember the specific day. I began my run about 8 30 am about 3/4 of the way through the run I began to fall behind the crew. I came to area known as the Abbott lakes area. I stopped to catch my breath. I then heard a noise off to my left on the hillside. The hillside was covered with oak trees  poison oak and thick brush.  The side of the hill was shaded from the sun so I had really looked hard to see what was hearing. I noticed what appeared to a man walking up the hill about 20 feet in front of me. I then realized that this was to tall and to wide to be a person. It was about 8 feet tall. It stopped  turned its head and stared back at me for about 30 seconds. When it turned the whole upper body turned with head. I could not see its face because of the shade. It turned and walked up the hill. I ran back to the station knowing what I seen was not human.  Later that day I was with my supervisor alone and I asked him if he ever seen anything weird near the lakes or the bone yard (trash area). He looked at me and said  oh you seen it to  he later went on to tell that other members of forest service seen it to. He states that the season prior that one employee said he seen close up and it was covered with hair. I just blew it off. A month later I was placed on the night shift with one other person.  One of the things was to check the bone yard area for campers. One evening we drove into the bone yard and about 30 feet in front of us was a dark  8-foot thing walking away from our vehicle.  I did not say anything to my partner until we drove out of the area. She turned to me and said   Did you see that?  I then asked her what the hell is it. She told me she had seen several times in past.  That was the last time I seen it that season. The 1995 fire season came around and due to budget problems only 3 people were on for the season. This made me nervous because this meant I would work alone 3 days a week. I avoided the bone yard area at all cost when I worked alone.  Halfway though the season a coworker and myself drove into the bone yard area to pick a picnic table.  My partner had a bad habit of wanting to catch a wild turkey for pet so as we drove up he took off running after a turkey that was about 40 feet from our truck. I did not see the turkey once I got off the truck but ran in the direction that my partner was running in.  As I got closer I realized that this was not a turkey we were chasing. As I got a better look at it I realized what I was looking at I only seen the upper body of it because it was walking down a slope. It had turtle shaped head and what appeared to be long tail coming from it. It moved at very fast pace away from us. I backed off  as did my partner.  I took notice of noise that it made as it walked away. I lost sight of it but I could still hear it running through the brush. That was my last season at this station. I havenâ€™t been back since. ,THIS LOCATION IS HEAVELY USED BY THE PUBLIC DURING SUMMER MONTHS. IS JUST INSIDE THE LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST. A NATURAL RIVER RUNS THROUGH NARROW STEEP CANYONS.

530,This report describes a sighting of a large biped primate at Fort Hunter Liggett on the evening of Saturday  February 16  2002.  I left my home in Manhattan Beach  California about 8 00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was Presidentâ€™s Day  my son was off school  and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12 30 PM alone  checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt  and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins. About 4 30 PM I stopped to look at a creek that crosses under Sulfur Spring Road near Lyons Pond in Area 7 as I drove Northeast.  I learned of the creek that is often used as a wallowing spot  on a guided hunt in 1999.  From the road I could see much recent activity.  It appeared as though quite a few pigs had been wallowing in the small creek the night before.  I drove on about 150 yards and parked my Bronco along Sulfur Spring Road. I climbed down the 20-foot high embankment to the creek to check the area more carefully.  There were very fresh wallows all along the creek with many fresh droppings in addition. I walked on to Lyons Pond  which was dry  and returned to Sulfur Springs Road.  All of the fresh sign was in Area 7 at the edge of the road  but I was registered to hunt in Area 10/13â€”on the other side of the road.  This is an important distinction at Hunter Liggett.  If you are caught with a loaded gun in an Area you are not registered to hunt  you are banned from the Fortâ€”forever. I solved this conflict by noticing that the pigs appeared to be using a large culvert to cross under the road from Area 10/13 to Area 7.  I decided that I would wait for their return on the 10/13 side of the road.  I positioned myself about 10 yards off  and 20 feet below the road.  My hope was that the pigs would be traveling up the creek through Area 10/13 to Area 7 just after the sun set.  It was about 5 00 PM when I took my position with determination to not move until 30 minutes after sunset. The first hour of waiting was pretty boring.  Nothing was moving and the forest was eerily quite.  About an hour before sunset the woods began to show signs of life.  A few Blue Jays and Woodpeckers flew by and a few frog croaks resonated from the small creek I was watching.  Closer to sunset I noticed two does moving through the woods and squirrels scampering about.  I knew that if the pigs returned to the creek it would be in those magical 30 minutes after sunset and that time was just arriving! Much to my disappointment  a blue Ford Ranger also arrived as the sunset.  Two hunters climbed out  grabbed their rifles and walked down a small  grassy road that entered the woods about 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I watched them pass and disappear on the road that was slightly above my hidden sitting position.  My hopes of a pig encounter of the close kind were dashed.  I was certain these hunters would either intercept my prey or scare them away with their movement and noise. I was heartened a few minutes latter as I saw both hunters returning along the road to their truck.  I watched them carefully with my new Swarovski binocular.  It was about 10 minutes after sunset and without the binocular they appeared as shadows in the darkening forest.  With my Swarovski binocular I could see details of the weaving in the plaid hunting jacket one was wearing and the rifles they were carrying.  They climbed into their truck and drove offâ€”leaving me with 15 more minutes of wild pig hope. These minutes passed slowly as I glassed the forest in search of movement.  The frogs in the creek began a loud chorus that added to the excitement.  There was lots of movement but no signs of pigs.  Chipmunks and squirrels were scampering about and I saw a coyote moving in the distance.  Drizzle started to fall  along with my hopes  as the last few minutes of hunting time expired.  I resolved to return to the same spot in the morning as I put the lens covers on my binocular and gather up my backpack and rifle. But before I could stand up I saw a flash of light color a few 100 yards back into the forest.  I had no idea what I had seen out of the corner of my eye.  The color was white or silver-gray  not a color that I would expect to see on a wild pig.  I looked off into that direction for a few seconds before seeing another brief flash of the same light colored object.  Both confused and intrigued I watched as repeated flashes of white or silver-gray coloring appeared in the forest.  Whatever it was appeared to be moving and after about 20 seconds of watching I realized that it was moving in my direction along the same road the two hunters had walked earlier. I believed I watched this creature move through the forest for about two or three minutes before I finally got a clear  unobstructed view of it against a light sky background.  My attitude was relaxed but attentive as I tried to figure out what I was seeing.  Patches of silver-gray flashed through openings in the forest  sometimes high  sometimes low!  My attitude changed to surprise and fright as I saw it take 4 or 5 full steps in a 30-foot clearing along the raised road  75 feet from where I was sitting.  I was wide-awake  completely sober  free from any medications  and completely focused on this approaching object.  I was alone  watching with my naked eyes  and heavily armed.  I had a Model 70 in 300 Winchester magnum in my hands and was carrying a Tarus Raging Bull in 454 Casull on my belt. What the hell was it? I donâ€™t know! It was walking completely upright on two legs. It was very large.  I estimate that it was 8 feet tall and weighed 800 lbs.  Not 30 minutes before I had watched two hunters cross the same 30-foot opening and had thought how small they looked.  In contrast  I was surprised at how big this creature was. It was covered with silver-gray hair from its very pointed head to its feet.  The only difference in coloration was a dark facial mask and similar colored palmsâ€”brown or black. I saw this creature in side profile and could make out few facial features.  What I could see appeared very flat  with little nose or chin protruding.  The silver-gray hair on the head rose about 8â€ from the top of the facial mask to a pronounced point at the top of the skull.  The head blended into the body without any visible neck in between. The silver-gray hair on the arms was about 4 inches long.  I could see this clearly as these very long  heavily muscled arms swung in cadence with its fast  uninterrupted  strides.  Bulging back and shoulder muscles flexed visibly under the hair as it strode along the road. It was not carrying nor wearing anything.  Both hands were empty.  There were no shoes  belt  pack or anything else that would suggest cultural development or advanced intelligence. Four long  powerful strides in a clear opening against the still light Western sky and it was gone! I was dumbfounded!  What the hell had I just seen?  It took me about 10 seconds to grab my backpack and start running up the 10â€™ grade to Sulfur Spring Road to get another look.  I slipped to one knee as I scrambled up the hill and pulled my Raging Bull out of its holster as I reached the road.  My heart was racing and my hands were trembling but it wasnâ€™t from the runningâ€”I was pretty damn scared! It was 40 minutes past sunset  but I was looking West toward an open field on the other side of the road  the direction in which this creature was headed.  There was nothing movingâ€”I couldnâ€™t see or hear any sign of what I had just seen.  I walked slowly down the center of the Sulfur Spring Road toward the point where the other road connected.  I called out a number of times to see if anyone or anything would respond.  Nothing did.  After a few minutes I slowly walked backward down the center of Sulfur Spring Road toward my Bronco that was parked about 200 yards East of where I had been hunting. I jumped in and locked the doors!  I turned it around and slowly drove back toward the Hacienda with the bright lights searching for any signs of movement along the road.  The drizzle turned to serious rain as I reached the Hacienda.  I went directly to the restaurant for dinner and a few glasses of wine.  I chatted with two other hunters seated at the same table.  We exchanged stories of seeing deer and fresh pig sign in the areas we had hunted.  They told me of seeing a flock of wild turkeys run across their path in Area 7  not far from the Hacienda.  I didnâ€™t say a word about what I had just seen.  I was sure they would think I was â€œnuts.â€   I was sure because I was beginning to wonder myself! It rained hard all night. A heavy rain continued until about 11 00 AM Sunday morning. I left the Hacienda an hour before sunrise on February 17th headed back to the spot where I had seen this unbelievable creature.  I parked in the same spot as the day before  and loaded my rifle and pistol before I unlocked the door as the sky began to gray in the East.  I watched the creek for pigs until about 30 minutes after sunrise  then began looking for footprints along the small road where I had seen what appeared to be a silver-gray Sasquatch. The road was covered with grass and extended only about 200 yards from Sulfur Spring Road to where it dead-ended at a small ravine. There were few patches of bare dirt and no tracks.  Either the grassy road didnâ€™t show tracks or the rain had washed them away. Or  perhaps  there had been nothing to leave tracks in the first placeâ€”only an over active imagination! From the end of the road I slowly still-hunted toward an adjacent ridge.  It was a few hundred feet above the surrounding ground and offered a good vantage point to glass for movement.  While I kept my eyes open for pigs  I was really looking for something silver-gray.  I saw neither.  At noon  I returned to Sulfur Spring Road and walked back into Area 7.  Lyonâ€™s pond had little new water in it despite the heavy rain over the last 18 hours.  There were few pig and deer tracks on the bare dirt as the heavy rain had washed most of the tracks away.  I saw no sign of any tracks that might have been left by the beast I saw the night before. ,A short logging road that enters Training Area 10/13 about half way between the Hacienda and Jolon Rd on Sulphur Spring Rd.

531,One night in 1978  my 4 yr. old daughter and I  along with my boyfriend and his family were standing around a huge bon fire we had built.  They lived on a ranch out in the country.  It was dark about 9 00 at night and the stars were out bright.  We were roasting marshmellows and having a good time.  Suddenly  we heard a sound none of us heard before  it came from the bottom of the small canyon nearby the ranch.  It was a very loud screech  howl  yelling burst of noise.  It filled the whole canyon up and down the creek bed with its hollaring screech.  We all began to ask  What is that sound ?  What could be making a sound like that?  We knew it was the sound of an animal but what kind  we couldn  t tell.  We were frightend!  As we listened we realized that he was getting closer  we could hear the bushes crush under him as he pushed his way through them.  We could tell by the sound that he was very huge and coming fast.  We all dropped what we were doing and ran into the house.  To my shame  when I got into the house I realized that my daughter was left behind.  I ran back outside to get her.  She was still standing there in the same spot  I picked her up and brought her into the house.  She told me that she saw him (the creature).  She said that he was very big and very hairy. She said that he walked up to her looked at her and then walked away.  She still remembers seeing him that night  I just asked her about a month ago.  I guess it will be a night we both will never forget! , ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Spring ,6057,yes
532,During the summer my husband and I would go to the Tahoe National forest in California to cut our winter wood.  This one day I did not go with him.  When my husband came home he said he saw a bigfoot print in the soft dust next to the dirt road.  He wanted me to see it so he drove me to the location some 20 miles or more away from our home. When we arrived he walked me to the spot and I saw what he saw. I saw a perfect foot print in the soft dust.  It was about 15 inches long. It was not real wide but  it was wider than a humans foot would be.  It had the imprints of all five toes and the rest of a perfect foot print right back to the heel. The indent in the ground was about 1/2 inch deep where the toes and heel were. It was quite amazing to see.  I know at times when I would be out in the deep forest I would feel as if I was being watched.  It was spooky.  I would run back to where my husband was or where our truck was. , ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6057,yes
533,This is the honest truth of an experience I had 20 years ago.  Iâ€™ve been meaning to submit this experience to BFRO for a while now but I wanted to find the right timeframe noted in my journal.  I had lost this journal but I recently moved and found it in a box while unpacking. I still remember it clearly  although I have never submitted it to any site such as this before. I am an avid backpacker and have backpacked extensively in the western states  in the wildest and remotest regions  and have encountered many large wild animals including grizzly bears. Never before nor since have I had such an odd experience as this one. I left one Friday evening (August 1  1986) by myself after work with my dogs (at the time my family had a beagle and a poodle  I  ll take anything hiking with me!)  and I was trying to find a lake up in Tahoe National Forest called White Rock Lake. I had never been there before so I wasn  t familiar with the unmarked roads. According to the topo map I could get there via a 4-wheel drive road. Way back behind Truckee  northeast of Fordyce Lake  I found myself driving slowly  at night  on rough rocky dirt roads  trying to figure out where I was. Roads would seem to peter out  or bisect with other 4-wheel drive roads  and I had no clue where I was going. I was way out in the middle of nowhere... no lakes or significant creeks or any destination type areas within miles. I decided to wait until daylight before I confused myself anymore in the darkness. I  m sure I didn  t even need to pull off the little  road  I was on since I hadn  t seen anyone or anything  but just in case  I did. I pulled off the rocky road just a few yards  my Datsun 4-wheel drive pickup hidden by trees. I grabbed my sleeping bag  tossed it outside in front of my truck  and me and my dogs slept under a very starry night. Sometime early in the morning  around 3 or 4 a.m. (it was still pitch black)  I awoke and heard something walking up the road in my direction. I could tell it was heavy  and it was walking steadily my way. At first I thought it must  ve been a backpacker  as it was obviously bipedal by the rhythm of the walk. The steps were distinct. Then I thought to myself  what would a backpacker be doing way out here on this road  in the middle of the night  with no light  with nothing but miles of thick forest in all directions? I knew it wasn  t a bear (I  ve encountered dozens of bears in my years in the wild). I had no idea what this was  but a backpacker was still my best guess. As it got closer and closer  I wondered if I should say something  but I didn  t want to scare anyone unnecessarily. I  m sure it would just walk right by. But  for some reason  I was getting increasingly nervous  and there aren  t too many things in the wilderness that make me nervous. The odd thing was my dogs weren  t making a sound  or a move for that matter  which added to the suspense. My dogs would have normally at least given a warning bark or two. This heavy  bipedal thing was coming closer and closer and was about to come to the point where I had pulled my truck off the road. I laid there very quietly. I didn  t know what to expect  and hoped whatever or whoever it was would just continue on by  not even noticing me. It was so dark I couldn  t see a thing. The closer it got  the bigger I realized it must be  because through the rhythm of the walk I could tell it was quite large. I stayed silent in my nervousness. A sasquatch was the last thing on my mind as I hadn  t really given much thought in the past to such a thing  especially in the Sierras. That was about to change. It came up to where I had parked my truck off the road  and... silence. It stopped. Although I couldn  t see it in the darkness  it was only a few yards away from where I was laying in my sleeping bag. I don  t know if I made a sound  or one of my dogs made a sound  but something happened that made it react. This thing let out the most heinous  forest-piercing scream you could imagine. I can  t even attempt to put in words what this thing sounded like. It had a set of lungs on it like nothing I could describe or accurately imitate. Then  still screaming  it turned around and ran back down the road in the darkness at a fast rate of speed. It screamed the whole time  echoing through the forest. It never let up. I could hear the screams fading in the distance. I laid there in total shock. I couldn  t believe what just happened. Eventually I jumped up and tossed everything in my truck. My dogs acted just as freaked as me. I knew whatever it was a long distance away by this point  so before leaving the area I drove down the road with my brights on  trying to see if I could see any footprints or signs of anything odd. My adrenaline was flowing big time. Although I didn  t actually get out of the truck  I opened the door and looked down to see if I could see footprints or any clue of what this thing was. The road was too rocky for footprints. I then let my dogs out  hoping they would pick up a scent (although I didn  t know what I  d do if they did)  but oddly they jumped right back in the truck. This was out of character for them. I tossed them back out again  and they jumped right back in. I decided if they  re as freaked out as I am  I better get the heck out of there and I drove many miles back towards the main road. I hadn  t thought much of a sasquatch before this experience  but now I  m certainly a believer. People try and explain it away to me  but I know what I heard. I didn  t see it  nor did I smell anything  but it was so close I could feel it. And it was so close when it screamed that I  m surprised I didn  t get spit on. Nothing in those forests could scream like that  nor run that fast  especially nothing that walked upright. I don  t dwell on the bigfoot subject  nor have I made it a mission to seek them out  but I know theyâ€™re out there. My experience is still very vivid. It doesn  t matter to me whether someone believes it or not. I  m not submitting this report to convince anyone otherwise. I  m just sharing an experience I had in the Sierras one night  near Truckee. ,Here  s the  general  area I remember it was one of the rough 4-wheel drive roads off the Meadow Lake Rd as I was trying to find White Rock Lake. From Truckee I went north on Hwy. 89 and turned east on Henness Pass Rd. then turned south on Meadow Lake Road at Webber Lake. ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6057,yes
534,In late summer of 1987 my friend and i were riding our bicycles down an old mine road sw of town. The road went down to a creek.We went down to the creek and on our way back  we pushed our bikes back up the road because it was steep.The road goes up along side a canyon and was old asphalt turned light gray and crumbling.We were maybe a third of the way back up.It was quiet  then suddenly a crashing breaking sound came from across the canyon.There was something running like a man covered in dark hair  face humanoid  right towards us  down the other side of the canyon.It was breaking small trees about 1 to 2 1/2 inches in dia. on its way down like they were made of balsa wood. We both saw this at the same time.It was making a bee line towards us.It scared the hell out of us and we ran as fast as we could trying to bike up the hill but it was faster running in the end  until we got nearer the top.There was no way it was a bear.It was clearly running like a man and the head was small like a man  with dark eye sockets .It was moving fast as it was a steep grade it was coming down.Whether it was running from something or at something  i dont know. ,its some thing id have to go back to find ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Fall ,6057,yes
535,On Labor day weekend 1993  I went camping with two friends of mine  Brian and Steve. We went to an area that had a little lake with an un-improved campground. My parents went up there that Friday morning and we went after work as Brian and I worked at the same place. We picked up Steve on the way out there. We got to the lake at around 9pm Friday night  and after setting up our camp  we sat and talked half the night. The camp was on the north end of the lake. There was a marsh area that had very thick underbrush to the immediate west of our camp. This marsh area extended to almost the southwest of the lake. If you picture a clock  the marsh area would be from the 8  0 clock to the 12  0 clock position. After spending all day Saturday fishing with my folks and having a great time  we all settled down and relaxed at the camp. We had dinner and built a campfire and we all stared into the fire telling stories until my folks went to bed. At around midnight  Steve  Brian and I were sitting around the fire when I thought I heard something in the marsh area. It sounded like something walking through there. Steve didn  t hear it and I just dismissed it at first. But Brian and I kept hearing it. It soundedd like something going back and forth like it was pacing the camp. I knew no one was camped in that area  so I just thought it was an animal. This went on for about an hour and a half. I even jokeed to Steve that the tent he and Brian were sleeping in was just giftwrap to a bear if one came after them and I  d sleep really good in the back of my truck. The next morning my folks decided to go home early. My friends and I decided to stay there a couple more days because Brian and I didn  t have to go to work until the following Thursday. By two that afternoon  we pretty much had the whole lake all to ourselves except for a couple of other groups of campers. At 2 30 Sunday afternoon  the three of us piled into my truck to hunt for firewood. We took a dirt road that went east to west along a ridge directly off of the lake  s entrance road about 1/8th mile from our camp. We were following this road in a pretty thick patch of woods for about a mile when it suddenly opened up into a meadow about 300 meters below the ridgeline of the hill we were on. There was another patch of woods to our south that paralleled the road for about 2 or 3 miles. I stopped the truck because we saw a ton of good firewood. Brian and Steve went in a southeast direction away from the front of the truck while I grabbed my axe and headed in a northern direction towards some logs so we could get some  all night burners . I got about 30 ft from the truck when I saw it. At first I didn  t know what I was seeing. It was a hairy thing sitting down against a tree with it  s back towards me. It was in the treeline we had just come out of. It was only 60 yards from me at most. I stood there frozen because I thought it might be a bear and I only had an axe and I didn  t feel like being any kind of hero. After maybe 5 seconds  it stood up on 2 legs. It looked massive  like 8 to 8 1/2 foot tall and at least 3 1/2 to 4 feet wide. It had reddish-brown hair all over it and it matched the color of the bark on the trees perfectly. It had huge hands that came down to just above it  s knees. It grabbed onto the trees just to guide itself through them  not push them aside. There were some pretty good sized trees in that patch of woods and they looked small when this thing grabbed them. It walked away from me towards the crest of the hill and I was amazed at how smoothly it moved. It was weaving in and out of the trees stealthily and it never made a sound  not a grunt  not a wheeze  nothing. I didn  t even hear footsteps. As it got near the top of the hill  it stopped and looked down into the next valley to the North and it just walked on over the hill never even looking back at me. I couldn  t see it  s face. I didn  t see a neck either  just it  s head set kinda on top of it  s shoulders. I stood there for about 10 seconds when I got the nerve up to get the hell out of there. I backed down the hill to the truck and I noticed that Brian and Steve were still gathering wood. I joined up with them after I got a soda from the truck and I calmed down. I gathered some wood with them and we got out of there. They never saw it. We stayed there another couple of nights  but we didn  t have another incident for the whole trip. I didn  t tell them what I saw because they wouldn  t have believed it. I never told anyone about it until I told my parents and my fiance   about it a couple of months ago after I saw your web site. ,About half way between Truckee Ca. and Sierraville Ca.  there  s a lake called Lake of the Woods. It  s about 7 or 8 miles Northwest of Independence Lake and about 15-20 miles Northwest of Truckee.  There was one road leading to this Lake in 1993 and it was dirt with rocks and pretty steep. Elevation was around 8000-9000 feet I believe. ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Fall ,6057,yes
536,A neighbor  s chicken coop was raided. I keep birds also so I was curious how I may reinforce my cage to avoid the same situation.  I investigated. What struck me immediatly was the strength necessary to  bend and compress  the wire used in my neighbor  s coop.  There is no way with my bare hands could I bend and compress the wire of this guage.  I collected hair samples. No cat could have done this.  A bear would have taken a much more destructive entry. ,along deer creek ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6057,yes
537,After reading report 7804  I suspect that my son may have seen a bigfoot in early December  2003.  His mother and I are divorced and where she lives outside of Grass Valley. There are houses out there that are close together but also big areas of wooded lots. He told me that he thought he had seen Bigfoot while walking home from his bus stop. Normally  my ex-wife picks my son up at the bus stop  but he had asked to walk home this day.  It is about 1/2 mile from the bus stop to his house.  As he was cutting across the woods  about 100 feet from the bus stop and 20 feet off the pavement  he jumped up onto a stump.  Below him he saw a black figure  taller than 5  10  (my height).  It was about 15 feet from him and breathing very heavily.  It had its arms to its side and was rocking slowly  side to side.  My son was afraid  but didn  t want to scream in case the animal reacted badly to the noise.  He just slowly backed up the hill  keeping his eyes on the creature and when he got to the pavement  ran home.  He said the creature turned its head to follow his movements  but otherwise didn  t move. When my son got home  he immediately told his mother and then later  me.  Neither of us believed it at first  but after seeing report 7804  which was in the same area  I thought I should submit the incident. ,The sighting was near Grass Valley. ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Winter ,6057,yes
538,We were driving up (withheld) road to pick our son at a friends house when the creature passed in front of our vehicle  approx. 15-20 feet in front of us. It was clearly illuminated by our head lights. It appeared 7 to 8 feet tall w/ thick brown/black hair. It had two long legs and only took two strides to cross the street.  Then  about 30 minutes later on our way back  we saw it again  this time our son was with us. ,Nevada County  near Nevada City  Californa. ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Winter ,6057,yes
539,First of all I am a 55-year-old male former Marine  fireman and state police officer just recently retired. I have been all over the world in the military and an avid camper. I have often heard of big foot and thought possible not likely. Although I didnâ€™t believe they existed I kept an open mind. I have seen many things in my time that were hard to explain but were not as vivid as the following. I was driving on Rte 80 e/b in California at 14 30 hrs. on 08/16/04 and I had just passed the truck inspection station and State Work yard which was west of the Donner Pass. As I was crossing over a bridge which crossed over a ravine with a river through it I looked down into the ravine and saw what looked like (about 7 to 8 foot tall) broad shouldered possibly male  all black from head to toe form stepping from the tree line on the west bank approx. 300 to 400 yards south of the bridge. I immediately pulled over to the side of the roadway on the bridge and slowed so that I could see it better (traffic was extremely light -two other cars.) When I looked down I was able to see that the form had no identifiable clothing or demarcation lines or hat. It then was walking in a lanky movement with arms swinging as it crossed the stream/river. I then noticed a slightly smaller (6-7 foot tall)(pos male due to no obvious breasts or femine movements) come out from the tree line behind the other male trailing him by about 30 feet and slightly south by about ten feet. They both continued across the stream and into the tree line on the east side and disappeared. I sat there trying to evaluate what I had seen. I then concluded that these forms were not any animals I  ve ever seen. They were one solid color from head to toe with no discernable clothing. They had nothing in their hands or on their feet. I could not come up with any possible concept as too why these individuals would be out there. The temperature was extremely warm so the clothing if it was clothing was way too much. Their faces and hands were the same color as the body. I then proceeded e/b with no further sighting. ,As you pass through on the east bound side on Hwy 80  just before Donner Pass  there is a truck inspection station. Approx 1 to 2 miles east of that is the first bridge.  There is a large ravine with a river through it. This is the spot. They were 300 to 400 feet south of the bridge they crossed over west to east in a straight line. I could return and show you the exact location. ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6057,yes
540,On the night of July 8th 2006  at Malakoff Historical State Park  I heard a man sized creature run up behind me and stop. I shone my flashlight and saw a pair of eyes down hill from me but they were as tall as I. I screamed and threw my flashlight at my husband and wanted him to see for himself. There was nothing there when the men looked around and there was also no sound of a spooked animal running away. Instead we heard catious and quite footsteps heading away from our campsite. This was no bear or coyote. It was huge  at least 6 feet tall and quiet. I wish I would have stared longer  but I was freaked out. When I stumbled upon your site I was suprised that there were so many sightings in the area. If you need more detail please feel free to contact me. I am a very impatient typist. ,Chute Hill campsite # 29... saw the creature to the west of the site ,Nevada,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6057,yes
541,Well  I  ve had a story to tell for quite sometime.  I belong to a world war two battle reenacting club for seven years now.  The place where this happened we have been going to before I joined the club.  The people in the nearest town of Foresthill know this club well. The story I  m about to tell you is true and the people involved are veterans of the hills of California. It was back in 1998  the second weekend of September (I know this because we always meet on the second weekend of the month).  Anyway  on Friday night  I was on my way up to the site to set up camp for next day. When I got up there  my unit commander was already there  so after we got done  we bedded down for the night. Before you knew it  it was morning and all through the night we kept hearing cars and trucks pulling up. The next morning we woke up to everyone there (all four units worth).  All that day  we battled from dawn until dusk.  When we were done  all tired and bruised  we managed to drag ourselves back to camp for dinner.  Some went into town  the rest of us stayed and had it there. Later  we were all back and sitting around four different fires and talking about the day.  One by one we went back to our tents or cots and sleeping bags.  The last thing I remember before I went to sleep was both of the commanders talking about tomorrow  s set up and that was it  or so I thought. Well  I was rolling over in my cot and slightly awake when  well for the lack of a better word  heard a  howling sound .  I  in all my life  have never heared anything like it before. It cried out eight or nine times . After a few moments there was nothing  so I got tired and went back to sleep  but only because the sound wasn  t too close to the camp.  It sounded like it came from where we where battling that day up on the ridge  about half a mile from us. I woke up again about one hour later. I had to use the bathroom  I put on my boots and walked over to a bush to relieve myself  and on the way back I heard it again  but this time it was much closer.  It was right down the road from us and it was loud  very loud  and I know that this time I wasn  t the only one to hear it.   Several times it let out . one after another.  This time it was much more deep and clear to the ear. My unit commander and several of the other unit people woke up. To my and their knowledge  we didn  t know what to do . No matter what I did  I could not stay awake but before I went back to sleep  I loaded my gun with real bullets and put my bayonet under my blanket near my pillow. What ever it was  if it came into camp and hurt me or anyone  I was going to kill it.  We heard it two more times that night  each time it was further away. When we woke up that next morning  many people were confused and in denial about what happened.  We all were trying to think of what it could have been  but no one said what was on everyone  s mind.  To this day it gives me chills up and down my spine at the thought of what we all knew it was. ,Finning Mill Road is starts about four miles out from Foresthill  the road gose far in. we were about ten miles in and it still kept going . the elevation was about 3500 to 4000 feet. Our site was on the top of the hill right next to the road if you go to the bridge you went to far. and there is an camp site there you cant miss it ,Placer,6,California ,CA,Fall ,6061,yes
542,I was camping with my father and my brother at a little spot that we had  discovered  last year and had camped out a few times. We had arrived early in the afternoon  set up camp  I shot a can or two with my pistol  ate dinner  and had settled in for the evening (it was about sunset)  and we had heard this fairly high pitched  moan  or wail  that continued off and on throughout the evening. It seemed to be coming from up the hill at first  and if I had to guess  within 300 yards. Well  as time went on  we heard  the noise move down the hill and down the side of the mountain  which is extremely hard to traverse. My dad and I kept speculating as to what it was  as he had hunted bear  deer  and elk  and could not place what it was. We thought  from the tone  that it could have been a lost animal  as it had a mournful tone to it. It had a very resonant quality to it  like it was a good sized animal. Anyway  the noise seemed to move along the side of us  and then we would hear it back at its original location rather quickly. I briefly thought that it was a large bird that kept flying back and forth  but it finally dawned on my dad that there was two sounds; they seemed to be calling to each other; that unnerved me  and my father and I went to take a look with our spotlights and me with my pistol and camera (I always carry a little disposable camera in case I see a bear or deer). We walked up the hill  (on the dirt road)  maybe 50 yards and saw nothing; when we got back to camp  I jumped in my truck and drove up the hill maybe 3-400 yards and saw nothing; I did not get out of my truck to look around as I was highly agitated (read pretty dang spooked) I turned around and kept flashing my spotlight down the side of the mountain occasionally and went past camp down the hill on to Foresthill Road and drove up the road a little ways before turning around again and heading to camp. My dad and brother reported that they had heard nothing and it was quiet for awhile. I sat around the fire and watched the tv that my dad had brought with him; my brother was tired and had gone to bed fairly early. Everything seemed fairly quiet until I went to go  number one  by a big pine tree across the road and as I was juggling with the belt that was holding my pistol in its holster  I heard that noise behind the tree and it seemed like it was maybe 30 yards down the hill  it startled me  to say the least  and I ran back to the relative safety of the campfire holding up my pants with one hand and my pistol with the other  much to my dads amusement. Needless to say  I did not venture from camp the rest of the night. We continued to hear the noises until we went to bed  around 0330 or so  I remember hearing it around 0345 and yelling to my dad (he slept in the back of his camper  my brother and I in my tent  15 ft away)  there it is again!   but he was sleepy. I finally drifted off to sleep shortly thereafter and no noise was heard again. THE  NOISE   Resonant. Very similar to the  Howl  on your website  but of a shorter duration  2-3 seconds or so each time. A note about my father and brother  my brother was very tired from working the night before and he drank quite a bit of beer on this evening; he may have also thought that I was trying to  spook  him as he does not go camping much. He was disinterested and does not remember much. My fathers curiosity was piqued  but he was not agitated or spooked like I was; his philosophy is that humans are the most dangerous creatures out in the forest and this was an animal  though he was not sure what it was and still doesnt. Also  he states that I heard brush or sticks being broken  but I cant recall stating that. I would not have even wrote this in until I had read the reports from the Tahoe area  which described such a similar noise  and is only about 60-70 miles as the crow flies from there. ,From Sacramento  take I-80 East towards Reno take the Auburn Ravine Road exit and turn right  cross the intersection and this is Foresthill Road. Follow it for about 17 miles and you  ll hit Foresthill  then go approximately 20 more miles to Historic Marker 8  which is Ford Point and look to your left  there will be a dirt road going up a hill. Follow that for 1/4-1/2 mile and look for a flat area with a rock ring off the right side of the road. The dirt road continues up the hill where it gets very rugged and you need Four wheel drive to continue much farther; it will then pop you up on another dirt road  which  if you go left  will dead end to another flat spot and another  primitive -type camp ground. During this camping trip we went to that higher campground and thought about camping  but changed our minds ,Placer,6,California ,CA,Summer ,6061,yes
543,I was camping at the Rubicon River with a couple of friends of mine  a place where we have camped relatively regularly for the past 5 or 6 years. Normally when I am there  I see many ground squirrels and chipmunks.  Occasionally  I will notice a few deer  especially near the campsites (from sloppy campers).  Normally  there are several birds in the area too. We arrived late in the afternon and realized that the area was unusually quiet.  No animals were scurrying or foraging. By nightfall  the area was nearly silent.  The only noises were the occasional cars passing on the bridge. We decided to do some exploring up the river after breakfast.  It was still quiet.  we wanted to find good rocks for climbing and jumping into the river. About a 1/4 mile upstream  we stopped at a formation that came up from the banks about 30 to 40 feet.  We free climbed and sat up top to check out the valley. Directly across the river (north facing bank)  the rocks were very dark  moss covered and looked fairly tough to climb.  There were also many trees and bushes. There was a deep crevasse near the water level that was 4 to 5 feet wide and full of growth.  we thought that it would be fun to find a way across the river and climb it.  At that moment  my friend Jeff noticed a rustling behind the shrubs in the crevasse.  He got our attention and we all checked it out.  A moment later  we saw a large  hairy figure move into an opening in the crevasse  in a crouching position.  It was crouched on the two rear feet and the front right paw was grasping a tree (to maintain balance?)  The hair was dark brown  and all over the body.  Although we didn  t see it stand up as it moved up the crevasse  we could tell that it was well over 6 feet tall  probably closer to 7 feet.  The face of the creature had no snout  but rather a flat face  much like a primate.  The rear paws looked much like human feet  but larger  maybe a foot and a half long.  As it went higher into the crevasse  it entered a darker area thick with trees and manzanita  at which point we lost it. At this time  we decided to leave and get back to our campsite as fast as possible  always glancing back to see if the creature was behing us.  Once we reached our site  we decided to cut the trip short and head back home. ,From Auburn  Ca... South on 49. South on 193. Turn left onto Main st (in Georgetown  CA).

544,Me and my fishing buddy went camping at French Meadows reservoir to get in the last days of the season.  In the campground we were alone and everything was shut down  nighttime temps were 32 and 29 the second night.  We were in the last campground on a dirt road a mile east of the lake.  Very few hunters were in the area because itâ€™s a game refuge and no other fishermen were in the area.  We got in camp around 9pm because the fishing was great and it took time to clean our fish.  As soon as we got there i gave out my whoop whoop whoop whoop  hoping to hear a return call.  This went on every hour and my buddy all the while half cracking up looking at me like Iâ€™m nuts. At 1am my buddy was asleep in the sack [his Cherokee].  At 1 30am  I let out my last calls  you could here the echoes for 3 to 4 second  s afterward.  10 second  s after my call I got a woooraa back.  I was shocked to get my first return call ever  it sounded to be a good 300 to 500 yards out and with a two D-cell flashlight  Ii was not going to investigate.  The direction the sound came from there were no roads or camps.  I knocked on my buddyâ€™s car and got him up hoping he had heard it but all he said he heard was me.  From now on I will take a recorder.  Iâ€™ve been hunting fishing and hiking all my life and that was the only time I heard this sound. It was not a coyote  a cat or an owl [I know them well].  In my heart I believe it was either a person or a bigfoot.  The remote area from which the sound came from tends to make me believe the latter. ,From Foresthill follow the signs to the lake  roughly 30 miles to the reservoir. ,Placer,6,California ,CA,Fall ,6061,no
545,ok. this story is happening right now...went out with my kids  my sister & my girlfriend to the park in auburn ca. after that we went driving through a very rich housing development to see the address signs that i made for the houses at my work  we were close to a lake called lake arthur. it was about 7pm? sunday  today  sept 30? we walked along the trail there about 30 ft. came upon a large tree branch or small tree  about 13 ft long  12  in diameter. i picked it up on end and tumbled it down the small hill side/river bank  then again to get it in the water...very heavy. no apparent reason for it to be lying across the path at all. continued on deeper down the path about 1/4 mile or more to a dead end. by this time it was very minimal light  started walking back our dog took a crap in the path ahead  and you could see it darker on the yellowish oak leave covered dirt path  and we could see to avoid it  when we got to the area that i moved the tree  my son said to me  watch out there is something dark and smooshy there  i stopped and looked at it  he said to me  it looks big though. it was a freshly wet imprint of a foot shape  and there were more leading from the lake up into the woods up a steep hillside. there was one great print  and a half a dozen others about 3  - 4   stride. and one like a slip or slide on the hillside. i said it looks like a small bigfoot print  because of the heel  and ball of the foot and a strange toe pattern. like pinky toe on the side of the foot. my kids got scared after that....i walked up the hillside where the prints lead about 20   into the woods  very minimal light  i saw 2 large black shapes laying down  one very large  and one about my girlfriends size about 5 feet away from the big one. both lying down.----girlfriend is about 5  1 heard noises  and backed off. as we walked the path the next 10-15 ft  we heard bipedal walking 2-3 steps  stopped when we stopped  and then continue. took my kids home  got my pistol  for protection only of course  and went back with my girlfriend. we took photos of the prints and measured them approx. 8  long. not very big. indentation  approx. 1  in pretty hard dry dirt. prints were wett and the rest of the ground was dry every where. my thought-maybe a curious smaller one came down and checked out the tree i pushed into the water and left the wet prints on the way back up? i have more on this  i hate typing  you can tell with my shortness in descriptions  i went back and heard an actual deep breath/slight grunt and more bipedal steps  scared me  even though i know they dont tend to harm people  i totally believe in bigfoot  and i have never seen or heard anything before. i am extremely skeptical  and i study  these kind of things. give me an email address so i can send the photos. i am going back in the morning. i am very excited about this. i have the photos  and 5 witnesses. my son found the tracks....they were almost crying to go home after the walking we heard. it was very heavy...not a bear  atleast the tracks were not. small human foot print with pinky toe on the side of the foot. not like your typical bigfoot print.this is within miles of sugarpine area  and foresthill. i have seen alot of stories in these areas on your site. ,take I-80 east bound toward reno from auburn  take meadow vista exit  cross over overpass  take frontage road left which i believe is still drycreek  you will hit a lake on your left. lake arthur ,Placer,6,California ,CA,Fall ,6061,no
546,This event took place 1992 in the Feather River canyon in Plumas County California. I and a good friend of mine were traveling north on hiway 70 just south of the hiway 89 intersection known as the Greenville Y. The time of year  if I remember right  was fall or spring. I remember it was not cold but not hot either and because it is heavily wooded with evergreens i can  t place which season it was. It was dark  roughly 930 or 10pm. We rounded a left turn at 45 mph and half way through the turn the headlights caught an animal standing in the right hand lane. I had time to react because of the slower speed we were traveling at so i turned into the left lane to avoid hitting it. I was very awed at the animal because neither of us recognized it for something we knew. It was roughly 4 seconds from sighting to passing it. I saw a large animal on all 4  s. It was facing left toward the left lane. Dark brown or black fur that was medium length. It was almost the size of a horse. As we rounded that corner I noticed the rear of it first then scanned across it  s body toward it  s head. As i was seeing it the legs were fairly long and then I got to the head. This is where I was surprised because the face was flat like a person face. No extended mouth or snout. As we passed it  it lowered it  s head to peer in through the passenger side window of the 1987 Dodge Caravan I was driving. I live in the area  Susanville  and actually grew up here in Lassen County  but did live in Roseville California for 22 years and traveled through the hiway 70 feather river canyon to and from Susanville to visit with my folks. I have never seen anything like this creature again. ,1/4 mile south on hiway 70 from the intersection of 70 and 89.

547,I recently read BFRO report .  I felt the need to add my own experience in the same area. I too was a Forest Service employee for the Plumas in the 90â€™ s. I donâ€™t know the original author.  I hiked to the bottom of the Middle Fork drainage where the Pacific Crest Trail crosses the river from the Quincy side (North side) so I could brush it out and cut some poles and logs laying across the trail. First day I had a couple guys with me  and we knocked out a good portion of it that day. I came back later in the week to finish up the remaining few miles by myself. The tactic is to go down the trail heavy with water and saw gas and work your way back up getting lighter.  I worked my way down the trail maybe about 2 and a half hours to the area where we left off. I started cutting my way back up the trail. The logs were spread apart with patches of down logs and then areas of clear trail for several minutes of hiking.  In the periods when I shut the saw off  I soon started to realize I was getting side hilled by something that was downslope of me off the trail about maybe 100 to 150 feet just inside the tree line. As I moved up the trail it did also. If it was a lion  I would have never heard it and bears are very noisy coming through the brush. This was not wildlife; this was CLEARLY a bipedal footfall. By the time most of my work was done. I was getting a little spooked and I just wanted to get back up to the landing where my truck was parked. Unfortunately  I never got eyes on it so I canâ€™t give you a visual account.  I was only able to occasionally see saplings move. To be perfectly honest I was too afraid to look. I had my head down humping gear up the trail  I was light and moving at good clip on a trail. This thing was EASILY able to outpace me even though it was working through steep rocky brush and tree covered terrain. At times it got ahead of me because of the contour of the land and that was a little bit horrifying. This thing was agile and fast. This went on for a couple of hours. About a half hour from my truck I stopped hearing anything. I feel I was being escorted out of the area. The whole experience was very unnerving. What bothers me the most is I donâ€™t know how long I was being watched. I was running chain saw intermittently with ear plugs in. Iâ€™m sure the three of us were being watched on the previous trip. We just couldnâ€™t hear anything with the saws running. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time in the woods and still do in a professional capacity. But that was a new one. If anybody is thinking this was a person; Ill tell you right now   there is no F****** way! ,[Note from investigator Matt Moneymaker This incident happened near where the Pacific Crest Trail crosses the Middle Fork of the Feather River.

548,Sent to the Internet Virtual Bigfoot Conference (IVBC) mailing list  I  ve been interested in the Bigfoot phenomenon for many years  and have read most of the serious books covering the subject  including Krantz  s stuff. About three years ago I began visiting a woman in Quincy CA  a small northern Sierra community which Tom Morris notes   has always been notorious for its Bigfoot sightings.  He sure was right. Over the last three years the local paper  the Feather River Bulletin  has reported seven different sightings in the same general area of the county. Five of those may have been hoaxed  but two deserve further discussion. The first one occurred at 1 15 a.m. on February 13 1994. Mary and Jerry Cain  Quincy  s only bakers  were returning from Reno. Near Lee Summit  ten miles east of town  a large fur covered animal crossed Hwy. 70 in front of their car and strolled up a steep bank and into the forest. It looked exactly like the many drawings they  d seen of Bigfoot. They doubt this was someone dressed in a Gorilla costume. When it was light  Mary and Jerry returned to the scene and found large  deep footprints in the snow. They took pictures of the prints  wrote a narrative of their adventure and posted the information on the wall of their bakery. I  ve had a chance to study the photos and I  m convinced they aren  t contrived; I  ve also spoken to the Cains and I believe they  re telling the truth about their experiences. The second sighting happened near Cemetery Hill  an area which divides east and west Quincy. It was about 11 30 p.m. on October 16 1995 when Larry Riddle  out for a stroll  smelled what he thought was rotting garbage. As he was looking for the source of the smell  he felt he was being watched. He turned and saw an eight foot  fur covered creature watching him. Riddle lived near Yellowstone most of his life   I  m familiar with bears and this was not a bear . He stated that there was no bearlike snout. He also refuses to believe it was someone trying to fool him. He felt it would be hard to mimic an eight-foot-tall Bigfoot.  I  m sure I  m going to get laughed at  Riddle said.  This thing was real. This thing was real.  , ,Plumas,7,California ,CA,Fall ,6063,yes
549,I was mining on the creek  when some movement caught my eye  as I stood up I saw  clear as day  a Bigfoot peering from behind a tree. The hair on my neck stood straight up on the back of my neck as I moved backwards across the creek bed away from it. As I did  I slipped on mossy rocks fell back and and banged my arm up pretty bad which required medical attention later  keeping a close eye on what it was doing. I know exactly what I saw as well as it saw me. We are talking about a distance of 60-75 yards. My mining partner was upstream from us and it knew that too  as he kept looking up stream looking for him. My friend must have spooked it my way. As it spotted me  already acting nervous  it leaped up and climbed over some rocks and was gone  as it knew to stay low like it was in a firefight  staying as much out of sight as possible. In a panic and injured I was heading up the trail as fast as I could. The behavior I observed was so fascinating that this thing was very tactful and knew exactly what it was doing. Quite the sure-footed creature! ,Plumas National Forest  California ,Plumas,7,California ,CA,Summer ,6063,yes
550,Various things observed during 2 summer field seasons working on my Master  s degree thesis in the Northern Sierra ( 14 months total). 1) I stopped to look at a topographic map about 20 miles west of Quincy Ca on the Quincy-LaPorte Rd-heard a modulated guttural scream-did not see anything-area is open Douglas Fir forest. 2) 3 different instances smelled a strong human feces smell while hiking -mostly in trailless manzanita/Douglas Fir/Talus slope areas-Slate Creek area. This area has great topographic relief. 3) Set of footprints and 3 pieces of feces -Upper Slate Creek. Footprints were found in soft fine silt overbank deposits on a meander of the creek and were approximately 11 inches long. I could very easily see the dermal ridges of the 5 toes  ball and heal. No discernable ball of foot was observed. Footprints were  square -almost all toes were of equal length ie  flat across the top. The 3 pieces of feces were approx. 3 inches long and 2 inches wide -light and dark brown mottled. A very faint human feces smell was observed. ,The different locations were around Slate Creek  Plumas National Forest  Plumas Co  Ca.  approximately 12 east of La Porte  Ca. ,Plumas,7,California ,CA,Summer ,6063,no
551,I smelled a strong odor  not a rotting carcass smell but sickly sweet and somewhat garlicy. I looked around for the source of the smell but could not locate [it]. In the same area I heard a screeching vocalization. It was not an animal growl  or raptor screech. I am familiar with bear and mountain lion sounds. This was not any sound I recognized. Footprints found around the area I ate lunch earlier. The ground was hard and rocky so I could not positively identify the tracks  but I am certain they were not bear tracks. The tracks were approximately 14 inches by 6 inches in dimension. I am an experienced outdoor worker. 25+ years with the Forest Service. The odor  sounds  and footprints were unknown to me. That is why I am making a report. ,Plumas County  California - Caribou Wilderness Area - T. 30 N. R. 7 E.

552,It was completely dark where we were. We had quite a large fire lit at the time. Nothing was found. Approximately at 9 00 pm at night after dinner we were all around the fire cracking jokes and laughing quite a bit. We go on the trips to the Granite Basin area at least twice a year. My friend Mark owns mineral rights to several mines in the area. The area is catacombed with several mines. Also noted  the area has many streams and creeks with beautiful clear water. Also noted  this is a very healthy forest with much new growth. Anyway  we were talking and laughing (my friend Mark is a loud person) and I have said that more than once how far I can hear him. All of the sudden he comes to me and says   Andrew  shut up and listen.  Mark seemed a bit riled up so I did what he asked. What I heard next  I will never EVER forget. It was this horrible screaming sound that I have heard before on my download from the Art Bell radio show. The one where you hear the sound he talks about saying   Bigfoot experts have confirmed this sound.  And how  you would never  ever  want to hear it in the dark of night in the woods.  It was the SAME SOUND!!!  I am sure of it. Would stake my life on it. It was farther away than the screams on the recording and could be missed if you were to talk. But make no mistake  once we all shut up  and we did  we all heard this. It even repeated like the screams in the recording. Someone suggested perhaps a coyote. No way  Mark and I are experienced woodsmen  and I have been inches away from bears while backpacking in Yosemite and have coyote  s where I live!  I know what a wolf sounds like. This was not even close to those sounds. Also noted  as soon as Mark originally told me to shut up and listen  we both verified the sound as being the one in the recording at the same time!!!  It was that unmistakeable. We have listened to numerous recordings and the one stated above is the only one that sounded like the calls  screams we heard that night. Also noted  the noise changed briefly on one call and sounded (don  t laugh) like someone strangling a cat. Also noted  it almost seemed like it heard us because the sound would stop and someone would make a joke and we would laugh and then we would hear it immediately after making noise.  Also noted  could not judge distance but it seemed like it was a couple of miles away (just a guess). Also noted  the sound came from above the basin where we were. We had taken a 12-gauge [shotgun] out  and fired it twice after this went on for a few minutes. Heard no more sounds after this. We do not hunt animals (we do not believe in shooting animals) we target-shoot and go skeet-shooting. We would never ever want to shoot one of these animals  save of course using a camera. Also noted  the night before  early in the morning  I heard what sounded like someone walking around our camp very softly and carefully. I did not even think about it at the time and it was too damn cold to even want to get out of my tent. No prints  smell  or any sighting was observed. I asked if anyone was out at the time and the answer was no. Also noted  I was pretty shaken after hearing this unnerving sound. I pretty much stayed by the fire the rest of the night. Looked often into the darkeness but saw nothing. No other animal sound was reported the rest of the night. After I got home I played the sound to the rest of our camp group  they all verified that it  sure did sound like what we heard.  Although  some of the guys had trouble digesting this. But still verified what I am saying here about the same sound. Also noted  it was opening weekend for hunting season but did not see anyone. ,Plumas National Forest (Granite Basin)  Near Bucks Lake.

553,The local paper (The Press Enterprise)  ran an article of foot prints being found in the Anza area  near Bautista Rd. This is a dirt road that leads to or near the indian reservation. There really is nothing out there but scrub  Manzanita  Oaks and pines at the higher elevations. I have hunted that area and hiked around there over the years. Many times I have been out there and knew or had some feeling of another presence. I don  t mean like small animals or anything of that sort; just some unexplained feeling that someone or something has been watching me or following me. Then the Press Enterprise came out with this article some years ago  and made me wonder if what it might have been was something a bit more unusual than I had imagined at the time. I worked with the University of California at Riverside here in Riverside as an archaeologist. In my work I have had a chance to work with a few native american monitors. These individuals come along and help to oversee some of our sites (especially those involving human remains). Through these acquaintances I  ve learned there have been some beliefs and possible legends of hairy creatures even here in Southern California. ,County of Riverside  California  Anza California and area to the east of Hemet in the San Jacinto Mtns. ,Riverside,6,California ,CA,Spring ,6065,no
554,This is a late report  but however  it is a valid one. What prompted this report is the fact that I now currently reside in Snohomish County Washington and just read about local sightings in my area  surprised at the number of reports. I used to live in Orange County California  and an old girlfriend of mine and I  were camping up in Dutchmanâ€™s Flats area  near Idyllwild. We were out-packing  not in a campground. We were awakened by screams that resembled the sound of a pack of coyotes that had just made a kill right outside of our tent. The screams however had a bit of a deeper tone than a coyote. At the time that is what we thought it was  so we stayed quiet not wanting to interrupt a wild animals meal. The screams and screeches continued for what seemed like an hour  but was probably about 5 or 10 minutes. The screams stopped  but we could hear what sounded like heavy footsteps right outside the door to our tent. We could hear sniffing sounds  and heavy breathing sounds. That is when I got really scared. I know a coyote does not step like a 300+ pound man in combat boots. I was too scared to even turn on my flashlight  and take a look. (Thinking maybe a bear had just run off what we thought were coyotes). We stayed up  paralyzed all night with fear until the sun came up. Even then there was still a dead silence. No birds  no crickets  nothing.  I was still scared to go outside  but did. I could see that something was in our camp  due to the scattering of pine needles and dirt around our tent. But there was no sign of a coyote kill  like no blood or fur laying around. What I did see was a pair of big deep footprints going away from our site down into a deeply wooded ravine. The thing  what ever it was  walked upright  and had a 3 to 4 foot gait.  I followed the steps for a few yards down into the ravine while my girlfriend watched. It was still deathly quiet and I had a very eerie feeling that I was being watched. The footprints led right into a thicket and I could see it was a wide path left by whatever it was. I turned and ran back up the hill  packed our stuff up in a big hurry and left. At that time I was in my early 20  s. I am in my late 30  s now and take my wife and kids camping all the time up here in Washington  but I do it with a new respect for nature now. ,I m sorry   it has been 12 years.

555,I was camping with my 7 year old son on top of Mt. San Jacinto  specifically Round Valley. This was the third year we had done this and the plan was to spent the night at 9200 feet and do the peak the next day. Spend another night in Round Valley and go back down the mountain the third day. The place we set camp was on the south east side of Round Valley with some large granite boulders to give us some shelter if the wind picked up. Surrounding our camp were ponderosa and jeffrey pines and not too far away was a small stream. This was early June and there were still some snow drifts in the shaded places. My son and I had eaten dinner and were getting ready for bed. At about 10 00 p.m. we were in our sleeping bags  but still talking and planning the trip to the peak in the morning. Suddenly without warning we heard a loud  low pitched whooping call in the boulders just above us. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and my son asked me if that was a monkey and I  not wanting to deal with a panicked 7 year old  told him it was just an owl. We did not smell anything or hear footsteps. Everything calmed down and we finally fell asleep. About an hour later I heard a load boom that sounded close to the tent. I looked out the window in the tent and saw a few clouds in the moonlight so I pulled our boots into the tent in case we got a thunderstorm in the night. The next morning we got up and had breakfast  then headed for the peak. We made the peak but by the time we got back to camp my knees were swollen and sore so I put some snow in a sandwich bag for a cold pack that evening to reduce the swelling for the trip out the next morning. That night was uneventful and we slept well in the high altitude air. The next morning we got up and began to pack up for our trip off the mountain. I went up on top of the boulders to make sure none of our trash had blown away from camp and make sure everything was picked up. I then saw what had made that load boom the night before last. 30 yards from our tent on top of those boulders was an 8 inch diameter ponderosa pine snapped off at the base. The tree was still green and fresh and had no rot in it and there was no wind to speak of either night. The only explanation I can come up with is that the animal that made that whooping sound had pushed the tree over. The tree was not aimed in the direction of our tent but rather parallel the direction our tent was pitched. I don  t think the animal was trying to do any harm but may have just been expressing it  s dominance over us. ,S.E. area of Round Valley in the Mt.

556,My girlfriend and I where on vacation in Idyllwild for the week and wanted to hike up to Lily Rock to the fire lookout cabin  but we couldn  t get to the main trail head due to my girlfriends fear of driving without chains up a black ice covered road  so we stuck around Hemet Lake for hiking and trout fishing due to the factor that the main roads were more recently snow plowed and grinded red lava rock laid for more traction. Plus  I had lived in Mountain Center a few miles north of Hemet Lake  so I was pretty familiar with the area and its wild life inhabitants. I  ve been Hiking  fishing  hunting  rock hounding  and Prospecting in just about all of California for the last 20 years  from the Cascades to Azusa Canyon. On one of the nights  I think it was the 16th of November; we wanted to go on a night walk around Hemet Lake since the whole city of Idyllwild goes to bed at 8pm and it was about 10 30 at night  so we drove the 8 mile drive from our hotel to the lake. We arrived at the lake at about 11pm and sat on the car next to some big green trash bins about 150 feet or so from the lake; when we heard something 400 feet or so breaking branches in a canyon to our backs. It sounded big and didn  t seem to care if it was heard coming down the slope  so I assumed it was just a big black bear until the smell. The only way I could describe it was a dying wet dog. A feeling of discomfort came over us both as we saw nor heard any more of what we assumed to be a big black bear coming down the canyon  meaning whatever came down the canyon was hiding in the tree line 300 feet or so away from where we sat. I got a chill up my spine and had that feeling that we shouldn  t be here right now. We got in the car and left to come back just under a hour later hoping what ever it was would be gone  so we could try to finally go on our late night lake walk. We pulled up and backed into to the same spot as before to notice that one of the green trash bins had been pushed over towards the lake  and that there was a 2 foot wide 4 inch deep circular dent like something big had punched it. There was no paint smear like a car had hit it. It was and had been dead quite other than the unknown thing that came down the canyon about an hour before. I had no idea what could have done that to a big steel trash bin and for years until Google Earth Mapping of Bigfoot. I saw that there had been sightings  calls  and smells reported in the surrounding area  and came to the conclusion that might make more sense being a believer in crypto zoology.  I didn  t check for tracks or any other signs due to the lack of info at the time  or I would have. ,About a mile down Hemet Lake Road near the picnic area North Shore Hemet Lake. ,Riverside,6,California ,CA,Fall ,6065,yes
557,I was camping with my wife and friends from the 23rd to the 24th of August  2008. My wife and I shared a campsite and our friends shared a campsite  with 2 tents  on a second campsite about 50ft. away from us. I had drank no alcohol before going to bed so I slept fairly lightly. I awoke at 4 50am. Just as I awoke  I heard a loud sound that seemed to me to be someone hitting a treetrunk with a large branch. I lifted my head in the tent and looked around for any light sources and saw none. I also heard no voices. I was intrigued enough to continue listening. Our closest neighbor had a Dachsund and the next closest had two larger dogs that were tied up outside their tent. Once I heard the first loud sound the outside dogs started moving around but didn  t bark. They made some moaning sounds but that  s all. From what I could tell  as far as sounds  something or someone walked through the campground from lower to higher through a ravine. It had very heavy footsteps. It sounded like it broke fairly large branches on the ground. Once it crossed the campground  s asphalt  the neighboring dogs started crying  whimpering and moaning. I then heard what sounded like a rock or something similar  being thrown against a tree near our tent and falling to the ground. Right at the crescendo of the crunching branches I decided to get up and unzip our tent window and at the same time the tent of the owners of the dogs opened and a woman came out and grabbed the dogs to quiet them down. That was the last I heard of the crunching  footstep sounds. Also  there had been crickets making noise all night until this event. Once this started  the cricket noise reduced to only crickets at a great distance. By the end of the incident there were no forest sounds at all. The next morning  we walked over to the ravine that I thought I had heard the biped walking through and found no footprints due to the extremely dry ground. I spoke to a family right next to the ravine and they had heard nothing that night but had heard footsteps the night before. The husband/father is a hunter and told me that he had seen bears 2 or 3 times in the past in those mountains but had never seen them down in the campgrounds in that area. Mountain lions are fairly common in those mountains  but what I heard seemed to be heavier than a mountain lion. Plus  whatever animal I heard sounded like it had two feet as opposed to four. I later found out that one of our friends had heard footsteps around his tent at about 4am. He thought it was our other two friends  camping with us  playing a joke on him. , ,Riverside,6,California ,CA,Summer ,6065,no
558,Was going back to close shop at approx. 10PM in the northern desert above Palm Springs  CA.  and saw a huge light tan colored biped with soft blowing hair .Because I was in a small VW bug with the light pointing down into the street upon leaving the driveway facing out into the desert. I froze there with my dim headlight on it and it too froze there completely still . I flashed my worthless high beams at it and it took 2 giant steps backwards and then one to my left  it  s right and was gone into the dark. I was overcome with severe fear  panic and anxiety  and had to return home again. I was armed with a .45 at the time and was still worried that if I shot it I would be in real trouble. Enormous  with the chest the size of a refrigerator. arms that hung below the knees and were still huge. I did not speak with anyone about it right away because who ever heard of a desert Bigfoot  But later found out that all the locals call him   Yucca Man . ,It was at the desert Hot Springs condominium complex approx.10 miles north of Palm Springs ,Riverside,6,California ,CA,Spring ,6065,yes
559,I remember the day like if it was yesterday. It was my first Boy Scout Summer Camp and I was 12 years old. We had traveled from Long Beach  CA  on a Saturday  the day before the other troops where to arrive. Our scout troop was through our church and we didn  t like to travel on Sunday. When we arrived at the camp we discovered that the camp staff had all went to Big Bear  CA  to a party so we where the ONLY scouts in the campground. We went down to our assigned campsite and set up camp. It was approx. 11 00 p.m. when we first heard the screams. We were all gathered around the outdoor stove telling jokes and stories when we heard the first scream. It started out like a wolf howl but ended like a man  s scream. It stopped the crickets from chirping! Our scoutmaster came out of his tent to listen as well. Then we heard it again. It sounded like it came from about 1 mile south of our campground. Needless to say we were pretty scared. We all went to sleep about 12 00 a.m. At about 1 00 a.m. my buddy Kenny woke we up and told me that there was something moving around in the bushes and trees next to our campground. We all woke up and Kenny got up and walked over to where the rustling was coming from. He then shined his flashlight into the area north of our campground. And there it was! A Sasquatch was standing in the tree line looking at us. We all broke out yelling and screaming. It was about 6-7ft. tall and had brown hair all over except the face. It had a very short neck and long arms going down to the knees. It  s eyes reflected the flashlight  s beam like a rabbit  s would; the eyes shone red. It turned and with long steps walked northeast from the area then up a steep wooded hill and out of sight. One of the guys actually pissed his pants from fright! ,Camp Taquitz  Scout Camp  near Barton Flats  San Bernardino National Forest  San Bernardino County  California. ,San Bernardino,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6071,no
560,I was sleeping in my van and my two friends were sleeping in a tent about 15 feet away. I couldn  t get to sleep and I heard something walking around outside. I could hear snoring coming from the direction of the tent and when I peeked out the window  I couldn  t see anything. I started to get up and all of a sudden  the van started rocking violently back and forth and I was thrown from side to side. I yelled real loud and the shaking stopped. My friends called from the tent and asked what the problem was and at that point I grabbed my flashlight and pulled back the curtains covering the back window and shined the flashlight outside. A figure moved towards the left and I could see it was walking upright like a man but it had hair from head to toe and in a second I saw it walk past the front windshield and head into the forest. I pulled open the side door and jumped out yelling for my friends to get up. It smelled really bad  like a cesspool  around our campsite and I was badly shaken. We started a fire and talked about what had just happened and I learned that something had been tossing pebbles onto the top of the tent and they thought it was me and then something had brushed up against the back of the tent and they also thought it was me. But after I told them about the van shaking  they swore it wasn  t them and we decided to pack up and head home early. Later  I remembered seeing a pair of glowing yellowish eyes through the trees after we had first arrived but they disappeared almost immediately and I figured it was just a deer or something to that effect. ,In the San Bernardino Mountains at the Barton Flats Campground  California  southwest of Big Bear Lake.

561,Dear Sir  I am a paranormal researcher/investigator and freelance writer  with a special interest in Bigfoot. Five years ago I interviewed a group of young people regarding a sighting. The sighting took place in the Mojave rive bed in Hesperia California. The first report came from five teenage boys who were exploring down in the riverbed late in the after noon when a noise in the dense under brush that grows in places along the river startled them. They said the noise sounded like something big moving through it. When they moved closer to get a look they said they saw a large hairy ape like creature. As this frightened them  the boys ran home and told their parents  which is when I first heard the story. The boyâ€™s father went down into the area of the sighting with a gun to see if he could see what the boys had reported  but found nothing. The boyâ€™s older sister rode her horse down to the spot on two consecutive days  to try and get a look at the creature. On the second day  her efforts were rewarded. In her statement to me she said   I was riding north in the river bed on my way home after searching for several hours  when I came to an area where there are two stands of cottonwood and pepper trees one on each side of the trail. My horse spooked and didn  t want to go on. I looked around and to my right I saw a tall hairy thing standing there looking at me. It looked at me for about a minute  then I turned my horse and ran her in the opposite direction and took another trail home.  I investigated the area and though I wasn  t able to see the Bigfoot itself  I did find what seemed to be a nest of sorts where the animal had been bedding down. I also found footprints that measured twenty inches by eleven inches. These prints were in very soft deep river sand so I  m sure the size is out of proportion  but maybe this will assist you in determining the animalâ€™s size. When I asked the young woman about color she said it was a dark brown or black. I didn  t think about it after making my own documentation until I read the recent article in the Mohave Daily News Archives. After reading the article I thought my information might be useful to you. My neighbor took some pictures of the footprints  and though they are of very poor quality I might be able to acquire them for you if you want. Unfortunately my witnesses wish to remain anonymous. ,From the Main st. exit on I-15 go east until you get to Choiceana Ave. turn left and go north to Lemon Ave. and turn right. You are now on a dirt road that will take you to the river bed infact you  ll be able to see it from Choiceana. In winter the river will have water in it  but if someone is going to go out there  the river is dry in summer. You  ll need a guide to find the exact spot  for there are no land marks that you  d recognize if your not from this area.

562,Hi  my name is Stacy G.  and I want this sent to Richard directly  PLEASE  he has already visited me about a sighting that I had in 1997  same place in  Hesperia. Well  guess what Richard  heâ€™s back!!!! I went to my momâ€™s house today and she said that her goose was dead. So  I went  out to look at it and itâ€™s neck was broken in half  and it had visible punctures in the neck.  I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s from fingers or teeth.  The goose was laid out perfectly flat with itâ€™s back feet facing to the rear.  Thereâ€™s no way it died like that  but looked as if it was laid out like that on purpose.  Then  in the middle of itâ€™s back was a huge patch of plucked feathers about the size of a large fist  then in the middle of that was a hole about the size of a silver dollar  and there were no insides left in the bird!!! Outside on the ground were a few left over intestines  and two perfectly clean rib bones. I have never seen anything like this except the last time he was here. Now  not only that  but we have a perfect footprint with four toes.  Also  we found a spot in the weeds at the back of the property  where he laid down  and a path of smashed downed weeds  that look to be foot prints  that are about four to five feet a part!! I Need for you to call me ASAP so you can come out immediately to see this or if I can go ahead and bury the goose. I want you to see this.  Please call me ASAP! My phone number is xxx-xxx-xxxx  or xxx-xxx-xxxx which is my parents number  where this accrued.  Also  I know he is going to be back  because he also tried to rip the roof off of chicken coop!!!  Hope to hear from you tomorrow  Stacy G. ,Near the Mojave River bed.

563,This is not a sighting  but I strongly believe it would have been. It happened 40 years ago this past summer. The year was 1963. I had to go out to California with my family. I really did not want to go  but I did not have a choice. We went out for the whole summer. My uncle rented a cabin at Big Bear Lake for a week. On the last night at Big Bear Lake my aunt took my mother  sister and me to the movies in town. The movie was over around 8pm so we then headed back to the cabin.  Once we arrived at the cabin I realized I did not have my wallet. I asked my aunt to drive me back to the movie theater  and she refused to take me.  So I decided to walk to town to see if I could find my wallet. When I arrived at the movie theater  I asked the girl at the ticket booth if I could look for my wallet. She gave me permission to enter the theater to look for it.  To my surprise  I found it stuck in the seat. When I came back outside it was dark. Something I didn  t think of when I left the cabin.  There was only one road back up the mountain  so off I went.  The road went up the side of a mountain  and it was a gravel road. I was walking along and started to hear something moving on my left. It was the sound of branches snapping when you step on them. Remember the road was on the side of a mountain.  The terrain on the right side of the road was a steep hill upward with a lot of thick trees and underbrush. On the left side of the road was a steep angle going down.  It would be very hard for a human to climb without slipping.  There were no trees  but a lot of bushes and underbrush.  That was where the sound was coming from. When I stopped to listen to the sound it stopped too.  So I started to walk again.  The sound of branches snapping did too. As kids back in Pennsylvania we always carried stones with us just in case we ran into trouble.  I had some nice sized rocks in my pocket.  I started to lob them into the air so they would fall on whatever it was down there. Then the breaking of branches became more vigorous.  When I stopped to listen  the thing kept on coming up the side.  The road went off to the right about 20 yards ahead of me. At the speed this thing was moving  I would not make the bend. Therefore I told myself if a car came around the bend I was going to be a hood ornament. There was no way I was going to let it go by me. God must have been with me  because a car came around the bend. I stood right in the middle of the road waving my hands up and down like jumping jacks.  My aunt was driving with my mother and sister in the car. I must have scared her  because she slammed on her brakes and stopped with only a foot to spare. I ran to the side of the car and got in. The first thing I said was lets go. I did not tell anyone about this at the time  because I was too shook up.  My sister knew something was wrong just by the look on my face. I did not tell my sister the story until we got back to good old Pennsylvania. ,The name of the cabin was called Peyton Place. ,San Bernardino,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6071,yes
564,I was living in Southern California at the time  I was 12yrs old  and was invited by my friends family to stay at a cabin with them at Big Bear lake for the weekend. We arrived before noon that Friday unloaded the suburban  and helped my friends dad take down the plywood from the windows before heading off to explore the woods and rock formations around the cabin.  After dinner we were discussing the next days activities and went to bed. The cabin look like in had been there awhile. Sometime during the night I had to go to the bathroom  and I knew the toilet wasnâ€™t working.  I got up walked thru the kitchen and turned on the light before going outside.  I left the door open so the light would shine thru  and I closed the screen door behind me.  I didnâ€™t want to go right there by the door so I walk over to the tree line on the other side of the parking area  and was reaching down to start when I felt really scared. I looked over to my right and about 20ft away something was looking at me over a bush. It was between 2 large trees and standing behind a bush parting the top of the bush with its hands looking right at me. All I could see was the upper chest  head  arms  hands. I stood there looking back for 15-20 seconds  and then I just bolted for the cabin.  I didnâ€™t look back  because I didnâ€™t want to. I ran up the steps and dove thru the screen door landing on the living room floor; I then reached back and slammed the door.  I crawled to the other side of the room next to the couch before my friendâ€™s father came into the room. He walked over to me and asked what was wrong  I looked up at him  and I just lost it!! I was crying and shaking so much I couldnâ€™t speak.  By that time my friend and his mother were there  and she helped calm me down bit. I told them I went outside to go to the bathroom  and something was standing there looking at me  They ask me was it a person  I said no!  It was huge  black and very tall.  His father asked was it a bear  I said no!  Bears don  t have hands!  My friends father went and got his flashlight  he then walked over to the door and opened it.  He looked at the screen door and looked back at me  what happened to the screen!  I said I left the door open for some light and jumped thru it when I ran back into the cabin. He looked back at the screen door for a second and then shut the door. My friendâ€™s mother said no one goes outside until morning when it is light out.  We stayed up for awhile maybe an hour or so  before going back to bed. In the morning I showed my friends father where I was standing and the spot were it was standing he look at the ground a little and the area nearby  but found nothing.  He just said it was probably a bear.  I told him it was not a bear its face was flat and the hands had long fingers. He said we should stay close to the cabin the rest of the weekend and not to go wondering around. Nothing else happened the rest of the weekend. The description of the face was very ape-like  and the nose area was different not as pronounced just smaller  with hair all over except the mouth area and eyes.  I didnâ€™t see any eye shine at all  and the head was pointed. The upper chest was massive  very wide and powerful looking. I notice the hands first when I looked over at it that night.  The hands were long with some hair not as much as the rest of it.  I did see a thumb on the left hand when it was parting the top of the bush.  The bush was taller than me at the time I was 5  7â€.  I didnâ€™t smell or hear anything. When we got back home my parents were told what happen  and that I was pretty shook up about it  and that I didn  t sleep much over the weekend.  I didnâ€™t know what I saw until later when I was in our local Woolworth  s looking at state boards  and as I past the magazine racks  there on the cover was a picture of Bigfoot from the Patterson film. I bought the magazine  and I now show it to my friends  and my family. ,I believe it was on the west side of the lake.  I remember when we drove thru Big Bear city; the lake was on the passenger side.  We traveled on a paved road  and then to a dirt road for a little ways. The cabin was a couple hundred yards off of the dirt road. ,San Bernardino,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6071,yes
565,During the early morning hours of August 14th at 1 am; I was laying in bed when I heard this god awful sound out of my bedroom window coming from my back yard.  I never heard anything so awful in all of my life.  In my life time I never heard a wild animal that could make an awful sound like that. Iâ€™ve heard through the years about this big foot stuff  and Iâ€™m not sure what this thing was  but while I was at the window looking I could hear foot steps in the leaves. It made the sound three times  so I made a mad cat fighting sound  and it was then that I heard the foot steps leave my yard and I know that it was human steps and not animal sounding steps. I went back to bed  but I could not forget that sound. A friend called the next day and I was telling them about it.  He told me there was some guys on the news who had found a dead big foot back east.  He told me to go to your web site for pictures  so I did for fun.  I looked at all of the pictures and listened to the different sounds  and when I got to the last sounds on your site page  I freaked out  because that was the same sound that I heard that morning. The next night it was back again  but this time I saw out my window this hairy thing which was very-very tall.

566,In summer of 2009  I believe I saw something that to me  was a Bigfoot. I was down at deep creek near Lake Arrowhead  Ca and I spotted something moving  very tall  standing atop a huge boulder about a mile away. I got a picture of it  but it was so far away that its a terrible photo. Everyone with me saw it  but specualted that it was just a person. Now this area where the  thing  was was very far away  so Im still not sure what I saw  but that exact spot was way out in the middle of nowhere. ,Hard to get to area  has limited trails.

568,Me and my family decided to go fishing at Silverwood lake and we got there around 1 30pm......i was fishing by the lake  and after a while of not catching anything i decided to put a 2nd rod about 100ft away from the 1st one..i went back to my 1st and around 3-4pm i decided to check on the 2nd rod and my 3&4 yr old daughters were following me so i sent them back with my wife.i thought they had gone back so i kept on walking towards the 2nd rod all of a sudden i heard leaves crunching to my left about 30 ft away from me i saw an ape like hairy looking creature with light brown hair....it had long arms that were swinging while it ran...it was also crouching a little to the front stood there in shock frozen for a while and realized my 4 year old daughter was behind me running back to my wife yelling  MOM!MOM! There  s a big animal! then i went back to mu wife and told her what i saw....What amazed me was the speed it was running...... ,When we got there there was only two people...but when it started sprinkling they left ....my wife me and two daughters had a beach umbrella so we stayed and were the only people there ,San Bernardino,11,California ,CA,Summer ,6071,no
569,I was driving back from Blythe and it was about 10PM   I slowed my semi down going through the mountains when I came to a pull out  and I got out to relieve myself. While I was standing on the passenger side of my truck  thatâ€™s when I heard a sound of rocks falling.  When I looked up  I saw something that I canâ€™t describe in words.  It ran 20 yards in front of my truck heading east; I jumped back in my truck and drove off.  Iâ€™ve never told anybody about this not even my wife  because I thought people would think I am crazy.  I have never drove that highway again at night.  What I saw was about 7 or 8 feet tall  it was grayish brown  and what scared me the most was the grunt it made when it crossed the highway. ,It was about 25 or so miles north of the Glamis Dunes.

570,Hello my name is Tracie Q.  and I am 35 yrs. old.  It has been over 25 years  back in the late seventy  s  and my family and I can still remember  to this day  what we saw and heard during our motorcycle outings in the mountains.   At one time  we use to have a cabin off of Sly Park Road in the Pollock Pines area  and we would ride our dirt bikes at least 50 miles a day never coming across the same logging trail twice. Well  the first time  we were on the trail walking  instead of using the bikes  towards plum creek. My cousins and my sister kept hearing things around us  and I remember my parents saying it was nothing just enjoy the walk. We all would hear branches breaking  and things that a child  at that time  would think to be very scary. Well  this time  we came across a large tree which had fallen within the last few months. This is where myself and my family  still to this day  give Robin my oldest sister hell. Our parents were behind us and my Sister  being a smart ass goes up to look at this jelly like substance.  She puts her finger in it  and tasted it. Well  it was not jelly  but blood  and this is what makes this about bigfoot. Just on the other side of this log  my parents who had just ran up to see what we were all talking about  found this large  and I do mean a large foot print. We realized we were looking at something that was made by a large animal/human. My Uncle who is a big man  he put his boot next to it  and the size of it made his foot look like a kids footprint. If I remember right  they were saying it had to be over size 16.  This was a fresh footprint and the blood was still wet  and all I can remember  was that we all started back towards the cabin like there was no tomorrow.  Now we can  t say that the blood was from bigfoot  but I know there was a large footprint. There was more than one time we came across something strange like that. Another time  I remember we were all on the bikes  and this time  we were either coming from or going towards the old ranger station that was located on the top of the mountain.  Where you were are able to climb the stairs to the top  which was over 3 or 4 stories high. Anyway  I want to say this was towards Grizzly Flats. I kept all of the old maps so that I could share the places we went with my kids one day. Well  there was a little snow left on the grounds that day  and we were taking a rest. My Mom has a thing for being the first one to step in fresh snow  so she goes off doing her thing  and all of a sudden she starts calling my Dad  not yelling  but you can hear it in her voice to get the hell over to her now.  When every body arrived at her location  there was this huge print  and it was human looking. The only thing about it was  that it only had one big toe. It was like it had all the others toes cut off  or just never grew them in the first place.  This print wasn  t as big as the first one that I had seen. I think we saw them about a year or two apart  so it was not the same day or anything like that. There were other times when we would be riding  and you could hear something like voices  but not voices if that makes since.  My Uncle eventually sold the cabin and we stopped going up there.  Now that I live here in the Sacramento area   I have driven back to Jenkins Lake area several times and find myself sitting and wondering about everything that my family and I had seen up there in the mountains.  We never really told anyone about what happened  do to the fact that some people just plan don  t believe.  Well I could tell them to stick it  because we are not crazy.  I know what we saw. We also would come across some old mines up there  and while at some of those places  you could feel like something was watching you.  I have tried to get back to Plum Creek  but a lot of the roads have been closed off.  What a shame there were so many beautiful places that are tucked deep into those mountains west of Lake Tahoe.  Well I feel kind of silly  but I just feel it was time to share these stories with others who believe.  Please feel free to contact me. I could tell you in person and my Mom and Sisters would also  but Dad is no longer with us.  He could have pointed the locations out on our old maps  just maybe my Mom can  but I can  t say for sure.  Thank you for taking time to read this. ,I just know the first time was towards Plum Creek  which is still marked on our map. The second time was off a logging road deep in the El Dorado Mountains towards Grizzly Flats ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Fall ,6017,yes
571,I dont think this was a BIGFOOT sighting  and in fact never even considered it until stumbling across your site  and reading a few things that were similiar to what we heard. But I thought I would share  if only for the sake of adding to your information base. I had a friend visiting  and we were both awaked around 2 00-3 00AM  by a very un-natural howling sound.  It sounded as if a pack of wild dogs was running past the house.  We didnt hear any footsteps though  just a very odd sounding howling.  But it was like a mixture of howling and heavy wind combined.  Note  it wasnt windy that night at all.  We heard it for about 10 seconds  as it went past the house and kept going.  We could heard the sounds fade in the distance as it ran off.  We both sat there terrified  saying  What the #$%$# was that??   We didnt go outside to check it out  rationalizing that it had to be a pack of dogs  or coyotes or something.  Until reading your site  I hadnt really thought much more of it. ,I live at the base of the Diablo Foothills  in the East Bay in California.

572,In the late 1960  s my father and I went deer hunting in the area of Railroad Flat  California We arrived late one afternoon and set up camp then we decided to go seperate ways and scout the area around camp for sign of deer. I climbed a small rise and came to an open area with a wide path running along the top of the hill. I proceded to follow the path for a short ways but I had an uncomfortable feeling. I didn  t see any deer tracks so I returned to where we had camped. The next morning I discovered it had rained lightly during the night leaving the ground muddy.I climbed the rise to the path where I had been the day before. When I came to the path I immediately saw large foot prints  they were very deep in the mud and about 14 or 15 inches in length. They were shaped like human bare feet. They were heading down the path that I had followed the day before  some of the foot prints were on top of the ones that I had left the day before. I proceeded to follow them down the path  when the path sloped downword the prints slid leaving elongated prints. The path continued on along the ridge top but the tracks suddenly took a left turn heading off of the trail and down the side into the trees and underbrush  needless to say I didn  t follow them. I just thought you might like to put this in your file. I was in a remote area and I don.t belive that anyone was near where we were camped to have faked the footprints. , ,Calaveras,8,California ,CA,Fall ,6009,yes
573,I was driving down into the campground area at about 6 30 am and I saw a large dark colored shapewalking in the willows along the creek. At first I thought it was a person  but it did not walk like a person. It had a very fluid walk with an exaggerated arm swing. ,Butte Meadows CA  in the mountains about 40 miles north of Chico ,Butte,7,California ,CA,Spring ,6007,yes
574,It happened a couple nights ago. I was watching a movie in my room when I heard a noise outside. This was about 1 in the morning PST. It sounded like a long blowing horn  so I turned my TV on mute thinking it was a siren. I knew it was not a siren when I heard it again  and I knew it was coming from something alive. I went outside and the noise was so disturbing that I actually felt scared of it. It was more like this cry but in a howl  like it was hurt and moaned in pain by an injury. I have a few dogs  and each of them were very disturbed by it too. They refused to come near the front or back doors. It was like they didn  t want to come outside. I assumed it must be a bear or a mountain lion  but the one thing that confused me was I don  t think animals like them sound like that. The day after this happened  my friend came to pick me up around 8 at night. We enjoy going to casinos  and there is one about 35 miles from where I live. The sun had just set  and we drove maybe no more than 4 miles down the road when I heard the noise again. I rolled the window down more  and my friend heard it too. It was close to where we were  so we slowed down to get a better hear. The noise stopped  so we started driving again. About no more than ten seconds later we saw what looked like a 10 foot man  covered in hair. This is not a joke  and when the headlights shined on his eyes they glowed. Human eyes don  t do that! He was pretty far from our vehicle  and no I didn  t see his face. His hair was black maybe dark brown  and yes his eyes glowed by light! The first thing we both thought was bigfoot  but neither of us agreed. I did a little look-up on my computer and found information on bigfoot. The howling  and the sight of that animal could not have been a human  and if it were then he had some massive eyes with big contacts to make them glow like that. I am pretty sure the car behind us saw it too  because they slowed down and stayed behind for about a minute after we drove away. We went about our business to the casino that night after our encounter  and now I am a true believer and have decided to notify you about this. ,It  s pretty simple to get to. If you know the California area around here that is. Drive into Sacramento and drive down freeway 99.

576,In late high school (1990)  a group of my friends drove out of Livermore  CA down Arroyo Road. The time of year was likely Spring or Summer as I do not recall it being cold. At the end of Arroyo at the time  or off a turn off  was a pumping station for the local reservoir. We parked in the street. The reason for this trip was a trek to the ruins of a former mental hospital. Unclear if there was a more direct road but Arroyo road was desolate and rarely used at that point.  We thought it would be fun and had attempted this journey before but were never successful. I was driving one of the 2 cars. It was after dark. The other driver and I got out of the cars and turned towards the hillside behind us. I was shining a flashlight along the hill and almost immediately notice a tall furry brown creature walking on 2 legs from left to right for about 30 to 40ft. This was approximately 40 ft away.  The other driver was next to me and I asked  Are you seeing what I am...  I couldn  t finish the sentence before he replied  Yes i am . I continued shining the light on the creature as it moved to the right and then started up the hillside and disappeared. As the others were getting out of the car  the other driver and i quickly discussed that we wouldn  t mention this to the others as it would only scare them.  We gathered flashlights and then proceeded up the hill behind the cars. I had been part of 3 or 4 previous trips to this location and had never been scared before like I was that night. Instead of shining the light ahead I was constantly shining it behind and around us looking for the creature. I was and am still convinced that what I saw was a bigfoot. So was the other driver. We later shared with the group who dismissed our sighting as a bear or some other creature. It was not a bear. It was tall  dark brown and clearly walked on 2 legs. While we had about 10 or so people in our party. Only the other driver and I witnessed the creature. Neither of us had anything to drink or any other substance. ,I believe the location was down Arroyo Rd.

577,My experience takes place around the end of October close to the end of deer season in Alpine County  California about 1982-83. Myself and 3 other hunters were getting a last deer hunt in Pacific Valley. We have hunted there many times over the years  however this time we were the only ones left in the valley. Myself and a friend of mine were hunting together near the Bull run trail head about 5 miles from camp. That day seemed odd after we got up the hill because we could hear no sounds and we could not see anything moving.(We both have biology backgrounds) We were on the edge of a meadow and had somthing like a rock fly over our heads. Be both heard it and I hit the ground. We could not see anyone and the hair started raising on the back of our necks. After checking the area we decided to go down the hill back to camp. The whole way down the trail somthing paralleled us just out of sight. Every few hundred feet it would roll or throw a huge rock down the hill along side the trail. I dropped to a knee a couple of times and swung my rifle towards the area where the boulers were rolling and could not see anything in my scope. We were getting a little shook up at this point and could not figure out what was following us and rolling the rocks. We have never seen any bears while hunting there and ruled out the possibility of a bear trying to scare us by throwing rocks. This continued until we got to the dirt road that took us back to camp. I would say this went on for about 20 minutes or about one mile. Once we were back in camp we related the experince to the other two hunters. The rest of the afternoon we noticed that no animals were around. We always have had animals around camp  chipmonks  birds and the occasional pine martin. After dinner we sat around the camp fire and were getting our gear ready for the next day almost bed time when across the creek out of our lantern light a large tree went down. It was a huge crash. It could have been a natural occurence  but with the earlier events we decided that somthing did not want us in that valley. We decided that no one was going to get any sleep that night anyway so we packed up and left for home. I have only been back there one time after that and saw through the tent screen somthing pick up my red ice chest with a white lid. I yelled at it and it put the ice chest down and ran off. I could not see what it was. My partner dismissed it as a deer going throuh camp and went back to sleep. I never heard anything else the rest of our trip.  ,Pacifc Valley  Bull run trail head. ,Alpine,9,California ,CA,Fall ,6003,no
578,While walking cross-country  looking for possible home sites from the early 19th and late 18 hundreds  I was walking the base of a small ridge between two lakes Lower Blue and Twin Lake. On the ridge side it was mostly open forest on the Twin Lake side the brush got thicker. As I was walking I heard a loud two tone whistle [low to high pitch] that was not a bird or any animal I know. The sound came from ground level and behind me to my left. The whistle was loud and sounded in my opinion from a mammal. I turned and called out thinking a hunter [in a place he should not have been][no hunting zone] but no one answered  I whistled back but nothing called. Wondering what it was  I investigated the area   till i could get no farther  the brush was too thick. I was standing within 10 feet from where the whistle came from  nothing in sight not in the trees on the ground not anywhere  no bird  s where flying and no animals in sight either. It was a little spooky but at the time i was cross-country running almost 5 miles a day at 8000 feet as well as boxing training and being a good bow hunter nothing scared me at that time. I was 20 with a good outdoor understanding and other people were the only things that scared me. I remember after I got back to the cabin and asked my Dad what animal out there [if he knew] that whistled like us but much louder  he didnâ€™t know of any. I did not think anything about bigfoot even though I was interested in the subject  I thought they were all up north in the Shasta and up area. I did not know that BF made whistling sounds until I went through the BFRO website. ,Hwy 88 to Blue Lakes Rd.   I think.

579,I have to say  I was looking for just such a thing  being that I have an interest in the phenomenon (for lack of a better term). The ground was rather hard-packed with sand by the river-crossing areas. While passing a patch of mud from a spring I examined it and found the definite impressions of a five-toed human foot. I really couldn  t believe it due to the odds of me actually wanting to see it (trying to be objective here). I checked for claw marks  such as a bear would leave  and found none. The footprint had pine needles covering most of it. Upon inspection I found the rest of the footprint was also there  down to the heel  and it measured approximately 13-15 inches in length. My brother and an Indian friend of ours  John  cleared away some of the needles to get a better look at it. (we were joking that John had some friends out there that wanted to make sure we had a fun time.) We took  I believe  two photos of this print with my hands pointing to the front and back of the track  but with the sun dirctly overhead  and not really a professional camera (although   I guess  Pentax is good enough for Steve ). I  m not quite sure how they  ll make out. I was now determined to search the rest of the trail  and made sure that I went first so as to not let anyone else disturb other potential tracks. Right away in a sandy spot ahead I discovered another one  followed by more. One of the tracks was half the size of the first  and it almost appeared to be three-toed in places. We took shots of at least one more good one before heading up further to the summit. Being that there are open mines up there  I was a bit elated that we may perhaps be entering a  hangout  so to speak. nothing else was seen or smelt or felt (at least not at that time) apart from a set of indiscernible tracks going straight up a snow embankment on the other side of the canyon. Upon returning  after summitting and checking out mines  I lagged behind to study the ground again. I found better traces in the waning light than I did earlier  including some tracks that were better than the first set. They were very clearly humanoid and large  with at least two sets again (large and small). Unfortunately  my brother and my friend had used up all of their film (not to mention they were way down the trail yelling back at me to  hurry up ). Upon staying back  and realizing I was alone  I finally got the jitters. Could  ve been my mind and the events leading up to that  but I felt I was being watched and I felt the need to bolt down the trail. I wouldn  t have reported this at all apart from the fact that I figured this may be helpful for any geographical data-basing you may be doing (migration patterns  whatever.) Also  this may or may not be related  but on a trip to Mt Lassen about a week before  my girlfriend  brother and I were the only people on the hill there (hiking up another closed-for-winter road  the loop). along the way we kept hearing a vibrating  whoop whoop whoop  that would seem to come from all directions. We chalked it up to being a bird  but the low vibrations could be felt. Interestingly also  the sound  followed  us. For whatever that  s worth  perhaps there have been similar reports from the Lassen area. ,Hwy 4 to Ebbott  s Pass road was closed for winter conditions.

580,I was done working for the day. I had my fishing pole with me this afternoon  hoping I would have time to do some fishing at Lake Alpine. I was fishing for about a half hour when I heard these strange howls form a distance that lasted for about 20 seconds  it repeated at least 3 or 4 times. I would say the howls where at least a quarter of a mile away. There were 2 people fishing on the lake at the time. The closet person was about 1000 feet away from me. I am very familiar with animal vocalization in the area. The howls where not from black bears  mountain lions or coyotes. Nor where any birds calls. I am a avid birder and I known my bird calls. ,right next to Lake Alpine lodge ,Alpine,9,California ,CA,Fall ,6003,no
581,We heard something we can only speculate about but I can still remember clearly the sound.  It was the middle of the night and I was awoken by the sound that started low and went to a high pitch scream.  I  m sure my hair was standing on end.  Then I heard it run off.  It was right outside our tent.  We were camping at Lost Lakes by Blues Lakes.  Our altimeter read about 8400 feet. There were no other people in the camping area around the lake and it was very quiet. It was a week night and the nearest campers were down at the Upper Blue Lake Campgrounds.  My husband is a very sound sleeper and did not hear it and said I must have dreamt it. He almost had me convinced when the next morning our friends who were camping with us and had their tent a little ways away asked if we heard the strange scream. He said he got up and went out side the tent to see what it was an was and saw nothing but there was a terrible smell outside.  We still cannot give credit to another animal and our family are hunters and have spent many hours in the wilderness around the country. ,Hwy 88 to Blue Lakes Rd. You go back to the PGE Campgrounds.

582,My family and I were driving in a remote area of the Sierra Nevada mountains last Tuesday looking for a place to ride our sleds. The sites we were seeking were few and far between as the area had no significant snowfall in over 3 weeks.  We were above the 7 000â€™ altitude marker along Hwy 4 and it was a mild  sunny day.  The ground was covered in snow. We had exited Hwy. 4 at the snow-play area west of Bear Valley and proceeded along the road to Spicer Reservoir despite patches of shallow snow still in the road. We were driving slowly along the road and  approximately 1 mile from Hwy 4  we noticed deep impressions in the snow along the right hand shoulder.  We stopped to examine these â€œprintsâ€  although I am hesitant to use this term as no details - like toes - were present.  These had obviously been here quite some time and had melted and frozen several times. They were large and deep  measuring 16  long.  What impressed me the most was that these prints were in a straight line. I recalled this was an attribute of bigfoot track trails  having read this in Dr. John Bindernagelâ€™s book and in other texts.  I retrieved my tape measure and discovered the distance of the step (that is  the distance between one impression to the next) was 60â€ in the first measurement and no less than 56â€ in the others. I am 6â€™ tall and was not able to match this step  especially not in shin-deep snow. I decided to submit a report of a possible track trail along with this photograph. ,1 mile south of Hwy 4 along Spicer Reservoir Road. ,Alpine,9,California ,CA,Fall ,6003,no
583,My wife and I were hiking for the afternoon in the Mokelumne Wilderness in Alpine County  California.  Our destination was Granite Lake  two miles from the outlet of Upper Blue Lake.  We reached our destination  had lunch and were returning  following the trail back the way we had come.  When we reached a pond  about 1/3rd of the way back  I expressed a desire to my wife to take a hike southward across the same elevation level as the pond  to another lake called Evergreen Lake. There is no trail or pathway to this lake  and I thought it would take about 20 minutes to reach it.  My wife declined to accompany me  so I told her I would return in a while.  I began walking  trying to keep my position along the same contour line as the pond.  The forest was fairly dense  and generally well covered with pine needle duff  generally underlayed with decomposed granite.  After a short walk  I realized that very likely few people had ever gone where I was headed  as there were no signs of previous travel  and the going was sometimes difficult.  I tried to stay on the contour  but kept slipping lower down I went.  After a while - more than 20 minutes  I realized that I wasn  t going to find the lake  so I started back.  As I walked back I took a different route  trying to regain the elevation I had lost on the trip out.  I came across a section of forest floor where there was mostly decomposed granite  and as I followed this - which was a bit easier to travel on - I come across two sets of footprints.  The first set looked almost human  except they were wider and longer than usual.  Noticeable were the toes  and a definite arch.  The second set of prints were from a larger creature  and left a deeper impression  especially in the heal area.  This track was wider still than the first  and looked similar to typical casts of Bigfoot prints. There was no noticeable arch  and the toes were not especially evident. Both set of tracks were superimposed at points  indicating that one creature was directly following the other  stepping in the same spots at times.  The tracks quickly were lost in the pine needles further ahead. It had snowed two days before  and the ground was damp  but most of the snow had melted.  These tracks were fresh  likely less than 24 hours old. ,There are no other directions to give  aside from what was given inn the narrative. ,Alpine,9,California ,CA,Fall ,6003,no
584,Three of us went on a deer hunt that morning. We had a hunter at the top of the hill and he went up there in the dark before sunrise. At dawn my uncle and I went up the hill together parting ways half way up. There were two other hunters not in our party camped by us about 200 yards away at the base of the mountain. We did not know them or their plans. Anyway halfway up the mountain my uncle went to the right (SE) and I went left (NW). The southside of the mountain (which I was on) was open with sage brush and scattered cypress trees. In the gulches of the face  were thick timber groves of mainly large pine trees  clustered  only to be seperated by the openess I just described.My plan was to stay in the tree groves working my way to the peak driving the deer to the top of the hill where the other hunter was positioned. I worked the grove until it ended forcing me to cross a clearing to the left to enter the grove located under the peak. When I got to the right vertical edge of the treeline to the grove  I found the first blind. It was made of a broken branch that was placed up side down and leaning against a tree. The branch was interwoven into the branches of the larger tree. At this time I had a feeling I was being watched and assumed it was the other two hunters that weren  t in our party that were camped a couple hundred yards from us at the base of the mountain. I continued left into the grove and found a 25 foot tree placed upside down next to another tree well over 50 feet high. The base was about 18  and had been snapped not sawed. Some branches had interwoven into this tree just like the little blind I first discovered on the groves edge. I  d guess the elevation was 8 500 feet  as the top of the hill was 10 000 and our camp was at the base of about 7 000. I now had an increasingly strong feeling of being watched again at this point. As I left the second blind/upsidown tree working my way up and to the left I saw the silhouette of a bipedal primate about 8 feet tall standing still looking at me. It was perpendicular to me  faced up hill in almost a runners stance  and looking over its right shoulder  at me  slightly with its wide muscular torso turned to me. It  s brow was extremly pronounced  its forehead was small with the back of it  s head slightly pointed. His head (assuming a male as it did not have breasts ) was proportionatly small in relation to it  s body. It  s arms were extremly long  hairy  lean yet muscular  It  s hands had very long palms and long fingers that curled back with a thumb that curled forward forming a backward capital  C  type shape. It then sprinted up the hill and vanished behind the trees faster than a deer bolts into a dead run from a standstill. It was on the left edge of the grove with a clearing behind it. This all happened in a second or two. I went to the place I saw it (60 yards) and found no footprints as the ground had at least a foot of pine needles that cushioned footprints and would spring back up when you walked. I used a tree that was close by gauge it  s height. It was of dark color but not sure if dark brown or black as it was shady in the grove with sunlight behind it in the clearing. I was in a state of kind of shock and almost not believing what I saw but knowing I did and simply just amazed. Because of this when I got home  later that week I decided to consult a hypnotist. I had never seen one but figured since they help witnesses recall a crime and descriptions of accounts that happen quickly or under stress it would probably help me confirm what I saw. The hypnosis confirmed my sighting.  ,We went into the backcountry by way of a trailhead off of Highway 4 west of Markleeville  CA. ,Alpine,9,California ,CA,Fall ,6003,yes
585,We lived in an A-framed cabin that overlooked Bidwell Canyon about 1 mile from Forest Ranch. The previous renter worked for a company that had her out of town frequently  so I am not sure on any encounters she may or may not have had. We had 4 large dogs and one of my chores was feeding and watering them daily. Two of our dogs were german sheppard/husky  which were tied on a runner that was connected to the top of the house and a tree about 20 yards away. We were the only house on that side of the highway  our nearest neighbors being across the highwahy maybe another mile away.The other two dogs that we had were a german short hair and a griffin  those two were tied up down in front of our house by our vehicles  one of which barked constantly. The one thing that we could not figure out was why every day and evening the dogs water - a 5 gallon buckets were constantly empty. We did not see any occasions where the buckets had tipped over  so that was one conclusion we discarded. Another occurance was the fact that the dogs would not come out of their doghouses after dark  which was odd. We did not have running water in the house  so we had to use an outhouse  which was about 10 yards away from the back door. After several alarming incidents where my mom and I  would make our trip to the outhouse before bed  we were aware of the sounds around us  usually stopping for no apparent reason. Then the frequent feeling of being watched  and the hairs on the back of our necks would prickle  leaving us no choice but to stop our visits after dark. There was one incident in which my step-dad was up late around 2 or 3 in the morning and he visited the outhouse where he heard the unmistakeable sound of something very large  on two legs approaching  through 3-5 foot high thick brush which is only accessable with a machetti. The creature was grunting in a gutteral  deep sound that communicated aggression to my step-dad. He felt severly threatened by this creature and began running to the house  hearing it follow just below the trail. There were no bears I can assure you. Another incident was the unmistakeable communication between three creatures  one above the house and two below in the brush. The calls were loud shrill whistles and chirps  then low gutteral  grunts. One would call  then two would answer. The last incident was while my mom and I were looking for one of the dogs that had been gone for a few days  we walked about 300 yards down below the house on a trail that led to an over look where you could see the bottom of the canyon  very beautiful. I seen a some indention by a large rock that looked like a trail  so we thought if we could go further down the mountain side  we might be able to call for the dog. Well  this trail led down a very steep coulie that had a few taller trees in it  and a rather sheer wall that was then turned inward toward the ground creating a type of shelter/cave. Under this overhang were three deep impressions that looked to be beds  scooped out and shallow with foot prints aound them in the loose powdery dirt. This really raised the hackles on our necks  and looking at eachother we quickly ran up to the house  so unnerved by this find. Thses incidents did not result in any photos  but definately a belief in the existence of Bigfoot. ,Forest Ranch about 16 miles from Chico  not sure which highway ,Butte,7,California ,CA,Spring ,6007,no
586,The whole story begins several years ago  1993 to be exact. At the time I worked for the US Forest Service  Plumas National Forest. At that time it was called the La Porte Ranger Dist. Long before this as a young youth my father had taught me to hunt  fish and trap. I made my spending cash in junior high and high school by trapping and like most young men thought I was Mr. Outdoors. I was in reality  a very good outdoorsman with several mountain lion sightings in my hunting and working career (16). Many were at very close range  within a few yards - much too close  but onto my only bigfoot sighting. It was late September and after working as a firefighter for years  I had moved to Silviculture where I had been working for about 5 years. My tasks included overseeing contracts for reforestation of clear cuts including the marking and measuring of unit  overseeing contracts to clear the brush  plant  brush suppression and thinning of units  testing tree planting and counting trees per acre as well as identifying tree species. I had two jobs slated for the day. The first was to meet a contractor and show him his work site and then I was to proceed to far end of Watson Ridge which drops off into the Middle Fork of the Feather River in Northern CA out of Oroville. This is a very remote area designated a wild and scenic waterway. The site I was heading for was a set of three small clear cuts setting within a few hundreds of yards from each other. We referred to them as the Mountain Lion clearcuts because a lion lived in the area and between 4 of us  it had been seen 5 times in 3 months. The clearcut I was going to was the northern most which was about 12 acres. It was basically a square shaped clearcut that sloped gently up a hill. In the lower NW corner was a patch of forest that was not cut about 20 feet circumference and located just a few yards into the clearcut from where you would park. I arrived at the site at about 11 20 and decided to eat lunch before I got started and though I would get into the uncut area while I ate to see if the lion would come by. I ate lunch and took and additional 30 minute break being very still and quiet to look for the lion. He never showed and I had work to do. This day I was counting the number of trees in the clearcut that had been planted in spring. Doing this meant that I would start by placing a spike through the open end of a tape measure so I could pull out the tape and measuring 10 feet. Then I would start moving one direction and count every tree that fell into the 20 ft circumference. Each one of these was called a plot. In every third plot I also identified the types of trees. Then taking a compass  I would walk approx 120 yds and start the next plot repeating the process. I had left the brush and completed two plots and started walking to the third plot when I heard loud noise ahead of me at the edge of the clearcut. The noise was so loud that I assumed it was a cow and I did not even look up. After a few more steps  more noise and this time I instinctively did look up to see a large creature walking up the edge of the brush line about three feet out of  the clearcut. It was about 110 yards away. The creature was walking North away from me at a 90 degree angle on two feet. I stood very straight up and down while walking. It only walked a few feet and then stopped  leaned over slightly and rested its forearms on a tan oak that was bent and facing horizontally in the air about 4 1/2 ft high. At this time  it was no further than 125 yards away. It remained there for about  45 seconds with its head turned over its left shoulder looking at me  Itâ€™s head or chin did not set or rest on its shoulder as it did not seem possible for the creature to do so but itâ€™s entire face was visible except for the lower mouth and chin. The creature was oriented so that I could see the entire left side from head to leg to about one foot from the ground. In addition  I could see its entire back and the back of the right leg from head to ground.  I could not see any of the right side or the front of the creature. It stood about 6â€™6â€ to 7 ft tall. It was very lean and I would guess its weight at between 350 to 400 lbs. It may have been heavier; it is hard to determine that without ever seeing the front of the creature. Its legs  although a little longer than a mans  seemed proportioned to a mans in shape. From the waste up however  the creature was very very large. I would guess about 40 to 45â€ waste but 80 to 90â€ around the shoulders. It seemed very man like  covered in two to three inch hair that was red brown on the legs.  It got somewhat darker to a browner as it went up its back. The hair was much shorter and thinner around the butt got longer and thicker as it went up its back. The hair on its back was not as long as on its leg but by the time it got to its shoulders  it was longer again and brown to dark brown. The hair coming down the arm from shoulder to elbow was red and 2â€ long. At the elbow  the hair end and the actual elbow was covered with skin like leather that was black. Oddly enough  this is the feature that stands out the most still to this day. The head was not as visible but human like. Hair longer on top and shorter around the sides with no hair from lower forehead to mouth. The hair on its head was dark brown to light black if such a color exists. For some reason  I never really focused on the face as it was shaded. I spent more time looking at the entire size of the creature and the bare elbow facing me. It was very calm as was I and I never felt any danger or anxiety from fear. I differently remember thinking that it is tripping on me and checking me out as much as I was tripping on it. As I stood there in the open  I had a strange since of peace. After a minute  the creature lifted up off the tree  turned away slightly and took two steps and I never saw it again. I did not go look for tracks which still seems strange to me even now. Even after the creature left  I was not scared and continued to take plots for several hours. I was anxious to return to the office and tell my friend but within an hour of work  I had talked myself out of telling this story to anyone at work. I did eventually tell two or three other co-workers. I have not shared this story with many but now am 50 years old and donâ€™t really care what people believe or think of me. Sorry for making he story so long. Iâ€™m sure I could find the exact site of this encounter again but being many years old  it probably would not help. ,Leave Oroville CA up Olive Hwy.

587,I was camping with 4 friends at Feather Falls campground several miles outside of Oroville.  We were the only ones camping there.  We stayed up late talking and what not and had gone to sleep about 1 00 AM.  Some time later  it was still dark out  I heard what sounded like a tree branch being wacked against the trunk of a tree  it had specific patterns and rhythms...but the interval of time between  episodes  was random...I heard similar noises from another spot in the area. I would estimate that these noises were about 300-400 yards away  maybe more.  My friends who heard it  who don  t believe in anything they don  t see  said it was a woodpecker.  I  ve heard a lot of woodpeckers  but never at that time of night  or with the irregularity of the sounds.  I didn  t hear any vocalizations at all. ,Go to the Feather Falls trailhead.

588,I am writing this for a friend who doesn  t have internet access.  Last summer  he was driving towards Oroville.  He had just passed a place called Robinson Mill and came around a corner when right in front of him at about 100ft  something was crossing the road.  It was walking on two legs and was covered in a medium brown hair from head to toe.  One thing noticed was it  s height; about 5 ft tall.  It  s build was long and thin for it  s height.  The hair hanging from its arms seemed to be long.  It was very fast as it ran. At first sighting  the being was walking across the road at leisurely pace but upon sensing my friend  s approach  broke into what he described as a very hurried and incredibly fast pace.  He said that it literally leapt into the brush alongside the road at a dead run.  It never looked in the direction of my friend  s approach.  It was right in the mid day  s sun and was a medium dark brown.  It may have been a younger one or something because it seems in most sightings they are very tall. Beginning of sighting was about a 100ft distance.  Distance was 35 to 40 ft at the last part of sighting.  He saw it leap into the Manzinita brush from only about 40 ft away!! ,Between Oroville and Forbestown.

589,It was dusk my friend  his girlfriend and I were relaxing and swimming at a launch ramp off of Vinton Gulch Road near Oroville CA. When we got there we heard faint sounds like there were two  what we thought at the time  mountain lions calling each other off in the distant. My friend fished while I explored and his girlfriend swam. When all the other anglers that we fishing too me and my friend started making very loud sounds just to hear the echos off the surrounding canyons of Lake Oroville. Then I remembered hearing on one of the sound recordings off of this website and how there was sort of a whistle at the end of the recording from bigfoot so I started trying to imitate the whistle. Well after about five minutes I heard something  running  through the treeline of thick bushes above the lake line. It was coming towards us. I asked if anyone heard that and the said no. Right after I said that we heard the same sound earlier but within I  d say 200 ft from us at the bush line. We jumped in the car and turned around so we could make an escape in case anything attacked. My friend shined his light along the treeline and seen some eyes low at the tree line. So I stared whistling like I did before and it would make its sound softly. Well after three times I started mocking it and to our surprise and what made us leave was it whistled back to us. We took off. I tried finding sounds of mountain lions off of the internet that sounded the same but to no avail. Then I listened to monkey and bigfoot sounds and the only thing that came close was a Black Howler monkey. It had almost the same cooing sound. I don  t know if it was a mountain lion that could whistle but I believe bigfoot is around and I will continue hunting on around Oroville CA for signs or answers. ,North down Hwy. 70 of Oroville.

590,In the early morning hours of Tuesday  September 21  2004  I drove towards Lake Oroville (approx. 25 miles from my house) to see if I could get any photographs of the lights of the Valley before sunrise. As I drove  I stopped a couple of times to take photos. It was extremely dark at the time  since the sun was not yet up and the area is against the mountain side to the North and North East sides. I turned my truck around stopped with my truck pointing toward the South West looking out over the Valley. My passenger side window was rolled all the way up but the driver side window was down. I had only been sitting there a couple of minutes when I heard a loud  very angry sounding  roar  coming very rapidly toward the back of my truck on the passenger side. I was quite startled (to say the least.. I think I might have screamed) and immediately looked back toward the direction of the sound but could not see anything but blackness. I then threw my truck into gear and took off rolling up my window as quickly as possible. It has been less then 48 hours since the incident happened and I am still very upset and more then a little traumatized. What frightened me the most was that the sound came from above the height of the cab of my truck and nowhere near the ground. It began behind me near the far edge of the road and lasted about three to four seconds then ended abruptly right at the back of my truck near the tail light on the passenger side. I could tell that whatever was making the sound was approaching very quickly. The sound was quite loud and very angry sounding and can only be described as a cross between a lion  s roar and the sound a tire makes spinning in deep gravel. I have never heard anything that sounded like it before in my life. I do not know whether it was a bigfoot or not  but if it was a bear it had to be standing upright and at least 7 feet tall. I have since found out that the only bears in that area are small black bears that are not aggressive. I am a 44 year old mother of four and Grandmother of two. I will glady agree to take a polygraph test to confirm what happend to me. ,Take Hwy 70 North from Marysville  CA approx. 30 miles to Oroville.

591,As a new High School graduate in 1977  I planned a camping trip to an area near a boy scout camp (Wolfboro) I was familar with  with my new girl friend.  As an Eagle scout and an athelete (I was recruited to play footbal at Cal) I wanted to impress my friend who loved the outdoors.  The destination was around a dammed watershed called Spicers Resevoir.  There was a dirt (logging road) turn off from Hwy 4  between Bear Valley and Angles Camp.  We drove down this windy dirt road (some 7-15 miles)  crossing over a little bridge that crossed a very shallow Stanislaus River (since it was very hot during this summer month)  until we reached the end of the road at the dam.  We packed about a mile down the river (?Green waters River) that ran out the bottom of the dam. Only one side of the river had a hiking trail. The other side of the river was a very steep and rocky (e.g. boulders) bank.  This was in the middle of the week  and I knew from my scouting and other trips that very few people were seen in this area.  I was setting up my camp at a clearing next to the river and my girlfriend was fishing.  It was hot  as she had a tangled line while wading in the stream. She yelled up to me that she saw somebody crossing the river above us  some distance  from the other side of the river. Effectively to warn me not to be surprised if they walked past on the trail.  Nobody came down the trail and we forgot the incident. An uneventfull evening passed.  The next day we decided to break camp and go back to the Stanislaus (maybe there was better fishing). This obviously required us to pack back to the car and drive a few miles to the little bridge crossing the Stanislaus River. We parked next to the bridge and found what looked like a fishing trail.  We packed along the trail (if you could call it that) until it was too difficult to hike.  There was alot of little pines close together and there was bigger and bigger granite boulders in our way.  We found a clearing  some 20 yards from the river. I pitched the tent next to a dried creek bed.  The creek bed was a few feet wide and the tent was a dozen feet from it.  The rear of the tent was a few feet from a slope consisting of huge boulders and small pines.  We made a camp fire when evening fell.  It was a clear moonlite night except for the thunder we heard in the distance. I remembered that there could be these rouge thunder clouds. Anyway  later in the evening when we were about to  turn in  we heard strong screams coming from the upsteam direction. This was in the direction where we ran out of a hiking trail. The screams occured periodically for 1/2 to an hour.  I rationalized them to be a sick or injured  range  cow. During my scouting days I was told that cattle roamed the area and the snow level would effectively heard them down the river valley.  We went to bed and must of only been asleep for a couple of hours when the thunder clouds were close enough to wake us.  I wanted to put some things (e.g. shoes) in the tent so they wouldn  t get soaked from the rain.  Once back in my sleeping bag I stayed awake listening  when I heard two foot steps behind us on the rocks of the dried creek bed. I listened more intensley and heard two more step  then a pause. I was really scared  especially since the movie Friday the 13th had been playing. I really thought it was a person stalking us.  I attempted to peer out the back (mesh) window of the tent.  Nothing was said between me and my friend and I didn  t want to alarm her  even though I was scared stiff. What I did see was a large silhouette standing and then moving (the two steps at a time) past a tree in that dried creek bed. After  what seemed like a long time  the thing moved/walked deliberately past our tent twords the river. The front part of the tent faced the river and was zipped closed. But this thing  that I believe was Big Foot  started splashing and making that strong high pitched screaming noise at the river.  I then heard foot steps come directly twords our tent and stop right in front of the tent. My hand was on my buck knife.  Then I heard it run away.  I think  after a while  we might have said something like  did you hear that?  lets get out of here . Day break was only a short time off and we waited only for the first sign of light.  We hastily packed up camp and drove home. We talked about maybe checking with the ranger  but we didn  t.  We eventually tied the  fisherman  crossing the river the day before  below the dam  to maybe not being a human but a Big Foot.  This so called  fisherman  crossing the river was  dressed  in very dark clothing  my girlfriend said  that seemed odd since it was so bloody hot. I haven  t changed my story in 25 years.  You could even contact my old girl friend if you like. ,See detailed description ,Calaveras,8,California ,CA,Summer ,6009,no
592,When I was in my early teens  my aunt was dating this fellow who lived in Avery  CA. He was an aspiring carpenter who was trying to build a cabin on his property. Though the main house was already completely built  he took it upon himself to build this cabin directly across the way  on the side of this hill. Running between the main house and the cabin was a creek  which stood at the base of the hill  that had a bridge crossing over it. Anyway  my aunt had decided to move in with him during their courtship and they decided to live in the cabin as it was being built. I had spent my summer there with them that year  but this was my first time being there during the winter. The area (Avery) in which they lived was heavily forested and fairly remote  with the nearest neighbor being several miles away. Needless to say  it was extremely cold at that time of year. As a result  because the cabin was a work in progress  and only had plastic instead of glass in the windows  the wind would howl through the cabin and we were forced to rely on a pipe stove for heat. On this particular night  I was sleeping downstairs on the couch  with my aunt and her boyfriend sleeping in the bedroom upstairs  and was shivering like mad in my sleeping bag. What  s worse  it had snowed the day before  so that also helped to lower the outside temperature and make things miserable as well. I was joined by their two dogs  who slept on the floor beside the stove. Well  as I laid there in my sleeping bag shivering  I heard a noise outside  like something was walking just outside the cabin. At first  I thought I had imagined it  but then the noise continued  which raised the attention of the two dogs. The next thing I knew  the dogs were growling in agitation and began pacing across the floor. Until this time  I  d never seen the dogs act so hostile. They were both usually mild mannered and friendly animals  and didn  t normally exhibit this type of behavior. By now  I was growing scared. Though I couldn  t see what was outside  I could hear it  and it sounded big as it moved around. My anxiety that night was increased significantly when I realized that whatever was out there could easily get inside. I was especially nervous because the front door was constructed of several two by fours and plastic  something which even the dogs could break through. Fortunately  after fifteen minutes of stark terror had passed  whatever was making the noise outside had moved on and things had quieted down again. Because there wasn  t anything left to growl at  the dogs returned to their spots on the floor and went back to sleep. I wasn  t so lucky  however  and laid awake for another hour or two  wondering if the whole episode had been a product of my imagination. When it happened  it began so abruptly and ended so shortly that I wasn  t sure if the surreal event had really occured. It wasn  t until the following morning that I knew for sure. Awaking the next morning before anyone else  I decided to take the dogs outside for a bathroom break. After going down the front steps of the cabin  I began walking downhill when I spotted what looked a set of tracks in the snow. The tracks seemed to start at the crest of the hill  pass by the cabin and then stop at the creek  only to begin again at the other side. Upon close examination  and after walking to the top of the hill  I could see that the tracks actually extended much further. Apparently  whatever it was had come around a bend of trees in the distance  walked across a small valley  crossed (stepped?) over a barbed wire fence  marking the government property line  and continued down the hill past the cabin. The tracks then crossed over the creek as if it had been jumped and continued up the other side. Now what made all of this so sobering that morning was that the prints looked like large humanoid feet. Each print had five toes and was about 13 to 15 inches in length. The stride between each print was about six to seven feet apart and each print seemed to be about 4 to 5 inches deep  if not more. Even more astonishing was the barbed wire fence that lay directly behind the cabin and what it revealed. I was amazed to see that it appeared as though this thing had just stepped over it without any problems at all  with one left and right print being on each side. What makes this remarkable was that  at the time  this same fence came up to my chest and was about 4.5 feet in height. As you might imagine  I was very excited about  this  it  s not every day that you see a set of huge footprints like this in the snow!  and tried to get my aunt and uncle to come outside to have a look. Unfortunately  though  neither one of them wanted to get out of bed and face the cold  so they never saw the tracks. Shortly after their refusal to come outside  it began snowing heavily and  so  the tracks were covered up. When I talked to their local friends about this occurence in the subsequent times we all got together  they believed me and provided me with stories of their own. One story that I repeatedly heard in particular was how people would pull over in the middle of the night  believing that the wailing that they were hearing was a siren on a police car  only to find themselves alone in the dark night. Because I didn  t want to be embarrassed or ridiculed by people  I  ve mostly kept this story to myself over the years  only telling my wife and several friends about it. I have  however  been interested in the Bigfoot/Sasquatch developments ever since and feel that this is an undiscovered species. I feel that Dr. Grover Krantz may have been on track when he speculated that this was Gigantopithecus that we  re dealing with here. Still  who knows? I only know that what I experienced that night was very scary and very real. ,I  m sorry  but I can  t recall the specific directions. I can tell you that I was there 5 years ago or so and that the area around Avery had been built up  though the main house and cabin still remained when I found them. ,Calaveras,8,California ,CA,Winter ,6009,yes
593,I am filling out this report for a witness that I have already spoken with.  Witness had two  events ; one a sound report and the other a print sighting.  The sound report happened in 1981 in the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness.  Starting at about 11 00 pm and ending at dawn  a whole series of howls began and continued every night for three nights.  The howls would start after two men with dogs started out into the forest after dark.  The howls were very deep  unlike anything witness has heard before.  The sounds would circle around a ridge and then end up where it started near their camp. They had a dobberman dog who was very afraid of the sound  and this is what alarmed the witness about the whole experience.  Witness has heard many bobcats and mountain lions  and this wasn  t even similar. Sounded to him like the howls on the BFRO website. Footprints were seen in summer of 1984 near Beartrap Cabin in the Mt. Reba area of Calaveras County. ,Sound report occurred at a campsite located up stream from the Board Crossing Bridge  near Frog Lake (up above the lake on a ridgeline).  Frog Lake is in Carson-Iceberg Wilderness on the Stanislaus National Forest.  The footprint was seen near Mt. Reba/Bear Valley  near Beartrap Cabin. ,Calaveras,8,California ,CA,Summer ,6009,no
594,Myself and 11 hunting buddies were camping near Liberty Hill.  We had been bow hunting in the area all day  since it was opening day.  Although other hunters were camping in the general area  we were alone at the meadow we were at. Late that night  around 2 00 a.m.  something ran through our camp screaming.  We all woke up with a jump  scrambling for our guns.  Whatever it was  was so heavy that it shook my truck as it ran by.  It knocked over a full ice chest trying to get out of the camp.  I was sleeping in the back of my truck but I couldn  t see anything in the dark.  The scream was a very high pitched  female-like scream. I have been a hunter for a long time and we have never heard anything like that.  The next morning  we didn  t see any unusual prints  so we never figured out what it was. As a side note  I still hunt in the area every year and nothing unusual has ever happened since. ,Take Highway 4 to Dorrington  then to the Liberty Hill area from there.

595,While camping in the Sierra  several members of our group were awakened by  repeated screams very similar to the Klamath and Washington State sound files at bfro.net.  I first  heard the eerie bellowing screams at 4 45AM and they continued until 5 05AM  followed by another short series soon after .  I thought it was over for the night until a short series of screams began at 6 30... from a different direction.  The vocalizations were grouped in a pattern of 4 or 5  blasts  (lung-fulls?) with a (resting?) pause of a few seconds followed by another series of 4 or 5  a pause  and so on.  This continued with only slight variation for 20 straight minutes; then the two other series mentioned above. While my wife says her heart was  beating like crazy   I was simply astonished. I  ve been interested in the bigfoot phenomenon for more than 30 years  so I had tears in my eyes as I paid close attention to this almost indescribable sound. To my thinking there are only two possibilities to explain these nocturnal screams  1) Someone playing high-fidelity recordings at high volume at 4 45AM  or 2) A sasquatch was screaming out  at night in the forests of Calaveras County. Either way -- MANY other campers had to have heard what we did. ,We camped at Big Trees State Park  3 miles or so up from Arnold  in the North Grove campground. Our two campsites were adjacent to the highway. ,Calaveras,8,California ,CA,Summer ,6009,no
596,Three successive screams starting from about 50 yards away  moving away to 100 yards  then finally about 200 yards away. Each scream was about 1 second in duration with almost identical characteristics. ,Starting from Big Meadow Campground heading down to the river  we camped about 100 yards from the river. ,Calaveras,8,California ,CA,Summer ,6009,no
597,This happened yesterday  My wife and I were exploring some forest land northeast of West Point  Calaveras County  CA yesterday in our 4x4 and on foot  scouting for deer. Near dusk we set out a picnic next to a creek.  About 15 minutes after sunset a long howl came up the canyon from downstream.  It was loud enough to hear over the noise of the creek five feet away.  In between the howls there was deep toned  jibberish-barking  noise  almost like two deep voiced men talking at the same time.  It did not sound like humans  but we couldn  t rule it out  until another howl answered from up on the ridge behind us.  Howls were exchanged from the creek valley to the ridge us and we were in between!  This ruled out humans making odd howls and  jibberish . The next thing we noticed is the cows that were grazing downstream all started heading upstream  away from the howl.  We could monitor their movements from their cow bells. We decided to pack up and high-tail it out of there  leaving right at dark.  Our departure route followed the creek downstream towards the source of the first howl.  As we neared where the howl came from  a buck bolted across the logging road in front of us  fleeing the creek bottom where the howl came from.  It was bolting up the hill before it noticed our vehicle. There are a few undeveloped creek access areas along the road and we looked at each one as we drove out  confirming no one was in there. A week earlier (last weekend)  as we were leaving the area during a previous trip  my wife stopped her 4x4 because someone/something whistled from the woods.  The whistle was loud and nothing like any birds she  d ever heard.  The kids heard it  too.  (I was following her in a Jeep). Upon arriving home we listened to our  Sierra Recordings  CD  s and the audio files on the BFRO site.  The howls were just like the Ohio recording and the distant  ridgetop  howls on the Sierra Recordings CD  and the whistling was just like the whistling on the Sierra Recording  s CD. i also noticed lots of (dozens) broken trees and photographed some a few weeks ago.  I  m undecided as to the cause of their breakage. This area is very easily accessible  with logging roads through-out and only about 25-30 minutes out of West Point  CA.  Parts of the area are currently being logged  with miles of fresh  very fine dust perfect for finding prints.  Much of the area has been gated off for about 4 years and is now open due to the logging. , ,Calaveras,8,California ,CA,Summer ,6009,no
598,THE PATTERSON / GIMLIN FOOTAGE The Patterson/Gimlin footage is a short piece of 16mm film obtained by Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin in 1967. It was obtained in the remote canyon of Bluff Creek  California  very close to the border of Del Norte County and Humboldt County. Both Patterson and Gimlin lived near Yakima  Washington. Patterson had been trying to obtain film footage of a bigfoot for many years. During the period he had also written a book entitled   Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?  He hoped some decent film footage would help answer that question. In this book he calls attention to the unusually large amount of testimonial and circumstantial evidence pointing to the existence of large  forest-dwelling primate species in North America. Bob Gimlin  a highly experienced outdoorsman  was a close friend of Patterson. He accompanied Patterson on several horsepacking expeditions in pursuit of film footage. Equipped with a 16mm hand-held Kodak movie camera  the two set out in October  1967 for a horsepacking trip in northwest California. Their search focused on the Bluff Creek area  because a number of tracks had been found there in prior years while logging roads were being built. Road construction workers had noticed large human-like footprints on the soft exposed soil of the new roads. The tracks were first reported to the press by . A local newspaper reporter came up with the name  Bigfoot  to describe the maker of the largest tracks. Tracks of six different individuals were repeatedly found on the new logging roads. The sizes ranged from 12.25 inches long to 17 inches long. In the early afternoon of October 20  1967 as Patterson and Gimlin  on horseback  followed a trail in the creek bottom  they spotted a bigfoot apparently drinking from the creek. Patterson  s horse reared in alarm as the bigfoot stood up and began to walk away. Both the horse and Patterson fell to the ground  with Patterson briefly pinned by the fallen horse. Patterson quickly worked himself free and grabbed his hand-held movie camera. While running toward the retreating bigfoot  Patterson shot 24 feet of film. Gimlin sat ready with his rifle in hand. Not wanting another spooked confrontation with this bigfoot  Patterson and Gimlin decided not to pursue it into the forest. At that point they felt they had the footage they came for anyway. After the footage was brought back to town and developed  a handful of investigators from the US and Canada returned to the film site and measured the tracks and other objects to help accurately gauge the size of the figure in the footage. The calculations suggested a height of 7 foot  3.5 inches. The footprints were 14.5 inches long by 6 inches wide. , ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Fall ,6015,no
599,My family and I were heading up north to meet my grandparent for salmon fishing. My father was pulling our trailer and had to pull over for some reason. We all got out and we were told to stand away from the road. My sister looked down into a little valley where a river was running. She had said look at those. As we all looked down we notice there were large footprints in the sand along the river and leading to the east  uphill toward the forest edge. As we talked about what they might be we all heard some noise coming from the top of the ridge on the other side of the river. Thats when we saw just for a moument a large creature walking on two feet over the ridge and out off sight. We jumped back into the car and drove off. I may have only have been 8 but I remember it clearly. , ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Fall ,6015,yes
600,About three hours after eating dinner I was sitting around a campfire with 3 friends and my husband.We were just sitting around the campfire and talking when we heard a loud crashing and rustling in the woods about 50 feet from where we were. I guess we all turned at the same time and just sat there in amazement  looking at a set of red glowing eyes. Not like a reflection from an animal  but glowing  much like a red light. What was also very odd about this is that it just stood there and kept watching at us for a minute or so and because it was dark  I could not see the outline of the body but could tell it stood about 8 feet tall. It then turned and walked away making the same crashing noise. Nobody said anything for a few minutes but after the shock wore off we really thought it was very spooky. We have lived  camped  hunted and fished in this county for many years but have never seen anything like this before. ,County of Del Norte  south of U.S. Highway 197  approximately 1 mile west of Highway 199 in a small park along the Smith River called Simpson Grove. ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Spring ,6015,yes
601,I had a visual experience in 1979 in which I was camping about 20+ miles out of Hiouchi CA in Del Norte County. I was traveling as a passenger with a local resident who was making a trip to Crescent City to go grocery shopping. It was @ 11 00 a.m.  a bright sunny morning. As I rode along  the lady giving me a ride into town told me to look out my window to the right. I looked to see what she was talking about and I saw a very large hairy creature walking across a wide  dried up creekbed.There were no trees or anything blocking my view. It was a wide open expanse. I did not see its face because I was seeing it from the side. I only saw it on its right side. It was headed in the opposite direction that we were going. To our left I distinctly remember a  watch out for falling rock sign.  I do not know the area there well. I was only camping there for a few days on my way back from Topanga Canyon in L.A. to Oregon where I lived in the Cave Junction area. I will never forget what it looked like. It had long darkish brown hair that covered its entire body. It also had a pronounced crown in the shape of the top of his head. It looked extremely muscular. I was at least 500  away and I  m not real good at judging height anyways  so I don  t know how tall it was. It walked with ease across a rocky creekbed. It seemed to ignore or be unaware of our car  s presence on the road. We were probably traveling about 30 mph when it happened. My friend told me she sees them all the time out there near her home  so it was just a normal thing for her. ,There  is a small concrete bridge just off Hwy 199 at Hiouchi which is between the Oregon Tunnel and Crescent City CA. If you are travelling north on 199 going towards Oregon the bridge and road would be to your right.This paved road goes for many miles south of the Hwy. I heard some people refer to this road as the road which was supposed to have been made into a super highway.I think they were just putting me on about that. ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Winter ,6015,yes
602,This is my story; not very many people believe this. When I was about 5 yrs old we lived in Hiouchi  Ca (1983). One day in the fall  I was staring out my living room window (it faced the woods)  and I noticed something really big and hairy. It was standing up on two feet  and dark brown in color. It was about 25 feet away from the window. The creature walked right in between two trees that faced my living room window and just stood there and stared at me. I didn  t even think of moving. It stood there for a while  it was probably five minutes or so  but back then those five minutes felt like forever! Then it just turned around and walked back into the woods. I know that it wasn  t a bear because it did it all on two feet. I still remember all this and it happened a long time ago. I did tell my mom but she said that I probably saw a bear  but I know it was not a bear. , ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Fall ,6015,yes
603,I live in Humboldt Co. CA and have heard night screams that sounded like an incredibly loud out-of-control frat party in 1985 when a friend and I were remote camping in a heavily wooded unihabited area around Patrick Creek in Del Norte Co. just north of Humboldt.  There were voices in deep male tonations as well as slightly higher and higher still [juvenile?]  I  ve heard coyotes  bears wolves etc etc. I  ve also spent time with my sister who was doing her graduate project in anthropolgy on primates at the San Diego zoo.  The closest I can compare the sounds to were Howler monkeys  but controlled.  The voices almost sounded like a dialect but none I  ve ever heard; like I could almost make out words.  The sounds were definitely primate in nature though definitely not human. At the time  my wolf-hybrid dog who traveled 300+ miles of the Pacific Crest Trail alone with me and who at the time was a veteran of wilderness encounters and very bold [never would hesitate to tree the largest bear] was trying to bite a hole in the tent to get in.  Once I let the trembling dog in the tent she actually tried to climb inside of my sleeping bag.  She refused to go back outside and remained whimpering in the tent with me until dawn.  At one point in the night  I awoke to hear a very heavy body tramping just outside the tent.  I heard breathing  very deep like in a broad-chested animal.  I dared not go outside until light.  Upon first light I went outside and saw what looked like a stampede had been through our campsite.  The duff was heavily scuffed with signs of foot traffic  which hadn  t been there the night before. I  ve read a few Bigfoot stories and I  ve noticed that sometimes the sound of children playing has attracted sighting situations.  I once had a problem with a mentally ill person who was sneaking in my horse barn at night and letting the horses out.  After months of frustration and being told I was paranoid  I got a remote camera that had some infrared capabilities.  As expected  I caught the man and turned in a point-blank video to authorities of him.  If your researchers want a good chance at getting Bigfoot on film  why not set up a week-long or so remote campsite with tents etc. and install a infrared video camera to view the camp.  Have recordings or better yet  actual children squealing in play through the hours of the night.  Review the tapes each day and see what you get.  It worked for me.  From the sound of how intelligent the Bigfoot may be  the more   natural   you make your camp appear as just a family outing  the more likely you  ll get what you  re after.  That  s why I think using real children would work.  Good luck getting any brave enough to do it though! ,Our camp was located just a short way up Patrick Creek road  maybe just 1000 feet up from Hwy 199.  We camped near the creek in a small clearing.  We arrived at dusk and left just after breakfast the next morning. ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Fall ,6015,no
604,A friend and I went driving to camp in Oregon on Hwy 199 in the fall of 1985. We didn  t want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two malamute cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many backcountry adventures. As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep. Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from  childlike  to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat. party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I  ve had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation. We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning. The second  experience  I had at Avenue of the Giants was with the samefriend while we were hiking a trail there. It was again the fall of 1985 about a month later than the first. We had a map with us and decided to cut a loop short by going crosscountry through the dense redwood forest. Not long after we got started  the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline. We reached the top and noticed large foot shaped impressions (maybe 14-18 inches long and 8-10 inches wide) in the duff below. Above us on the length of ground the dog drug us through  braches were snapped off clean up to 10 feet high on the trees. We made our way back to the main trail with no further incident. ,Off Highway 199 just south of the Oregon border.

605,While walking uphill about 1/4 mile from Hunter Creek I started to climb over a large fallen tree that was pointed downhill. As I climbed over I noticed  30 feet away another tree that was also laying on the ground. As I looked  I saw a Bigfoot  stooped over  watching me from behind the trunk. The face was a medium black  with a large brow bone that almost stuck out as far as it  s nose. The hair was medium brown with light spots (light reflections?). It  s face had darker lines where the skin folded. The face was smaller than one would expect on an animal this size. The eyes were brown and set a little closer than a humans. The nose was flat and wide. I noticed it  s lips as being black and thin after it curled it  s lip up while he was staring at me. I also noticed the teeth and the lack of any K-9  s. It seamed to be around 5 foot tall while stooping over  but could have been around 8 feet when standing erect. After a few seconds it turned and disappeared behind the tree. I went over to area and saw several prints in the forest debris. I followed the prints uphill but soon lost the tracks due to the forest debris. ,Hunter Creek  Approximately 3 miles east of hwy 101 ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Winter ,6015,yes
606,I was camping at Del Norte Campground outside of Crescent City California.  I woke up very early in the morning before anyone else.  It was about dawn. I was walking to the campground bathroom and I heard the loudest yelling I  ve ever heard that is hard to explain in words.  It echoed all thru the mountains.  It was a yell by something  but not a man  bear  or wildcat.  It took place 3 times. Needless to say I ran the rest of the way to the bathroom and my heart was pounding.  I don  t know how else to explain it but with a yell or a hollar but so loud it would echoed off the trees and thru the mountains.  I didn  t see anything  but I was too afaid to do any looking. A while after that I was watching a big foot documentary  where someone had recorded sounds they thought to be big foot.  This was the exact same hollar I heard.  It made the hair on my arms stand up.  I  ve never seen that video since and I would love to see and hear it again. ,Going Southbound out of Crescent City a little ways entering the redwoods is a campground on the left hand side of the road.

607,As a young person I vaguely remember hearing something about a creature called  Bigfoot . I suppose I thought he was something the Indians had conjured up. That is how others seemed to think. Then approximately eight years ago  my sister gave me a book to read during a visit in Florida. I think it was called  Mysteries of The Unexplained.  I found it to be an interesting book  especially the story about a creature called  Bigfoot.  I don  t remember the details  however  I do remember thinking that there is much more to this so-called myth than meets the eye. Sometime later I saw the famous  Patterson Film . A film of a large  heavy  hairy  bipedal subject quickly walking away from a startled cameraman and his horse. My curiosity at that point had me wanting to find out for myself what the truth was. Was this creature real or just a never-ending series of hoaxes and grossly exaggerated stories? I was in no position at the time to set out on an expedition so I promised myself and a few close friends that someday I would head to the northwest corner of the United States  the reported home of this creature  and answer the question for myself. Years later the opportunity finally presented itself. I started purchasing enough supplies for a thirty day solo expedition into the northwest. Having recently read three books on the subject of Bigfoot  I thought my best bets were either Washington State  Oregon  Northern California or Idaho. Sightings were consistent in and around the large forests of these states. While purchasing supplies  I picked up the August issue of a camping magazine that  as it turned out  contained an article about backpacking in Northern California. The article stated that you are more likely to see a bigfoot in the forests of this region  than another human being. I took the article seriously. Northern California here I come. At this point I had read enough material to have a plan that I was confident would bring me face to face with one of these creatures. My plan was not to go after one. It was to give one the opportunity to come to me. I just had to put myself in itsbackyard. As I made my way into the northwest corner of the state  I realized I wasn  t in for a casual stroll through a forest. This forest was thick with undergrowth and either going almost straight up or straight down. One week into my  hike  into the back-country I decided to change my plan. After reflecting on conversations I  d had with the locals  I decided to turn around and head for an area about twenty-five miles from where I was now standing. The people that had talked openly with me about bigfoot activity  all mentioned geographical locations that were in the same general vicinity. They also said that there hadn  t been any activity there in the past ten or so years. After making my way to this new location  I met a man that had lived there for the past thirty years. He said pretty much the same thing everyone else said. I had come to the right place but I was about ten years too late. He then pointed to a spot on my map that to the best of his recollection was the area many footprints and sightings had been reported over a decade ago. That would be my final destination. At this point my feeling that a bigfoot was no longer in this immediate area was growing somewhat stronger. I considered the possibility that bigfoots had lived here at one time and now lived elsewhere due to the logging activity in this valley some ten to thirty years ago. The forests of this area are large enough to play hide and seek with the entire U.S. Army. Dense forest covers the land further than the eyes can see and these creatures could be anywhere in it. I pressed on. As I made my way toward my final destination I continued to look for signs of something big and heavy leaving some kind of marks on the earth. If they were still around I should find something. I came across what looked like a bedding area for a creature that could fit a bigfoot  s description. It was a bowl like depression in the ground about eight feet in diameter. Everything within this circle was flattened. It was only fifteen feet from a stream. Convenient I thought. There was also what looked like a large print on the side of this bowl headed toward the water. Many small to medium sized trees in the immediate vicinity were bent over or broken off at the base. It all fit  but it could be a bear  s resting place  I thought. I left without bothering to take a picture. That same day I followed an old logging road to a point that it turned into a poor excuse for a rabbit trail. Along the way I found three depressions  about 14 inches long and 7 inches wide  in the soft mossy like growth between two old fallen trees. It appeared to be three steps taken by a very large and heavy bipedal animal. Coincidence  I thought  and pushed on. By this time on my trip I had seen several bear  a couple of deer and two mountain. Their tracks were all over the place -- especially bear tracks. Bear excrement was also in great abundance. This put me at ease. The better they were eating the less they would be interested in what I was eating. Blackberries are abundant in August  and from the looks of the scat it appeared the bears were taking full advantage of this. Visibility was usually about ten to fifty yards through the trees. Some of the noises that had been around me on a regular basis were bear and deer that I could not see because of the poor visibility. At the start of this expedition I would reach for the pepper spray at the mere sound of a couple of squirrels playing in the leaves. This behavior was probably due to the fact that a bear had wanted to join me for dinner the very first evening I was in the bush. I  ll never forget the sound of him coming towards me through the forest. From that point forward I was well aware that I was carrying approximately forty pounds of bear bait (thirty day food supply) on my back. As my time in the woods progressed so did my ability to guess what animals were around me by the sounds they made in the brush. Given the opportunity  my eyes would usually confirm what my ears had told me. Since I was on foot and usually on a logging road  I sometimes got extremely close to animals before they realized I was there. One time I had walked to within 35 feet of two bear (not on purpose) that were feeding off to the side of the logging road. They never heard  saw or smelled me. Anyway  I reached my destination and made camp at the intersection of four logging roads. It was now almost two weeks into the expedition. My plan was to recon the three logging roads that led down to a river. If I could get to the river I might find some nice fresh bigfoot tracks in the sandy banks along the waters edge. I checked out the east road that evening. No luck. It dead ended about a quarter mile from the river just like the forestry map showed. I went back to camp  ate dinner  set out a chem-light and hit the tent. I put the chem-light out in hopes of deterring bear from casually strolling into my little area of operation. The night passed without incident. I slept like a log. How appropriate. The next morning I checked out the north road. Success  it led right down to a nice open field next to the river. The map I was given by the National Forest Service showed it to dead-end about half a mile short. I  m glad I checked it out. I thoroughly checked the southern bank of the river. No tracks. The northern bank was covered with heavy growth  therefore I did not plan on a crossing to check it out. No tracks and I was sure this was the place that had stirred up much of the controversy some ten to thirty years ago. As I stood in the field and looked back towards the forest  I decided to check all around the field. I started at the west end. Almost immediately after starting this new search pattern I came across a depression similar to the ones I had recently seen but didn  t pay too much attention to. Again there was no detail because of the type of ground. It was a bigger and deeper depression than I thought a man or bear could ever make. I looked further and there was another one and then another one. This time I was sure these were tracks because there were about seven of them strung together in the pattern of a natural bipedal walk. I walked in the tracks. The bottom of the depressions were very hard. As though something of great weight had made them the last time this ground was wet. The distance between the steps was not extraordinary  at an average of about three feet apart. I lost the track momentarily over hard ground and then found it again. It was a consistent track. I figured I was tracking him (I say him when in all actuality it may be a her) the opposite direction he was walking judging from the shape of the tracks. It was now time for something to happen that I had never considered or read about in any book. I followed the tracks through a soft section of ground to the base of a fifty foot tall pine tree. At the base of the pine tree was an area of ground that looked as though it had been trampled down repeatedly by this heavy creature. It was at that very instant that I realized he had been leaning against the tree. Then it occured to me that if he was leaning against this bark and sap covered tree  there must be hair stuck to it. I moved may face closer and there it was. From a level of about three to six feet off the ground  hair was stuck in crevices and tree sap. I collected some samples and then stood  in the same place that this creature had stood  with my back against the tree. I couldn  t help but notice the nice view of the open field next to the river he might have enjoyed while standing in that position. The surface of my back from my buttocks to the area between my shoulder blades naturally was against the tree. If this creature did not put his head against the tree  as I did not do  then I guessed that I was about 2 feet shorter than the Bigfoot that had rested against this tree. I  m 5  10 . After collecting the hair samples from the tree I continued tracking. I had only gone another twenty yards when I found a similar trampled down area at the base of another pine. This pine however was a much younger tree and the top had been broken off at a height of about 6 feet. The top was lying off to the side. As I looked closer I noticed that all of the branches on the side of the tree directly over the trampled down area were either bent back and to the side or broken off. Hair was all over this tree as well. This creature wasn  t resting against trees  he was scratching his back! I continued the track and had only gone another 15 or so feet when I found another young pine that was in the same condition as the one I had just inspected. The top had been broken off at about the 6 foot level also. More broken and bent branches with the telltale hair stuck in the bark and sap. This creature had a definite itch. Since I was tracking him backwards  I guessed that he must have tried to rid himself of this itch on the two small trees. They probably weren  t sturdy enough to satisfy him so he made his way over to the large pine and finished the job. The tops of the small pines that I found lying on the ground still had a small percentage of green needles with the majority looking brown and dying. I don  t know enough about trees to make an educated guess as to how long ago the tops had been broken off. I ventured to guess that it was no longer than a month before I stood in the very same spot. Wow  he had been through here quite recently I thought to myself. For some reason I thought he had just been passing through and was no longer in this area. He had been here but was long gone into another valley. Looking back I am not quite sure why I didn  t think he was still around. Maybe it was because I wasn  t finding any fresh tracks. I continued tracking him for another three hundred yards or so. He was about as hard to track as an elephant through a corn field. The tracks led to the edge of the thick forest undergrowth at which point I decided to terminate my efforts. Looking back over the area I had tracked  I realized he had stayed just inside the edge of the wood-line the whole way. A smart bigfoot  I thought  unlike the bear and deer that were leaving their tracks all over the place in the wide open field. As I started to circle back around the east end of this large open field next to the river  I came upon a large pile of excrement. It looked human except for the fact it was a very large pile and the contents were plant-like. As I mentioned earlier  I had seen a lot of bear dung and this looked quite different. Tracks led up to and then appeared to straddle this dropping. Again  this was not the best ground for holding a track  however it did look as though the tracks were made by a large  heavy  bipedal ... bigfoot. I collected a large sample of the excrement and put it into a plastic baggy. At this point I was feeling pretty good about what I had found and satisfied that this had been a successful expedition even if I wasn  t going to see a bigfoot. I had hair and excrement samples -- good physical evidence that a bigfoot is still roaming these woods. I looked around some more and found two more of the same type of piles fairly close to the first one. I remember thinking this must have been his bathroom. He probably would feed all night  get a drink from the river and then relieve himself here. If this was being done by a bigfoot then he seemed to be a creature of habit. By this time I had been down by the river for a good few hours. I headed back to camp which was located about two miles up the logging road. After dinner I decided to go ahead and recon the west road which was the last logging road I had to check out. It came to a dead end just as the east road had. As I was making my way back to camp  before the mosquitos set in  I noticed something I did not see on my way out. On the north side of this old logging road stood a young pine tree that had been topped at a point about 6 feet above the ground. I immediately looked down at the base of this tree and saw what I knew I would see. The large trampled down area of ground. Those big padded feet had stood right there. I then saw the tracks leading up to the tree as well as the top of the tree lying on the ground off to the side. This time I closely inspected the broken off top of the tree and found hair stuck on it. Hair most likely from the side of the hand that broke it off. I must add at this point that I was keeping a lookout for claw marks in the tracks and teeth marks on the broken off tree tops which would most likely have been left behind if a bear had done this. I was paying attention to this not for myself but for the people that would ask me later about it  when this expedition was done. I had no doubt what was doing this and it wasn  t a bear. Anyway  I didn  t find a trace of either claw or teeth marks. This time I kept the broken part of this little pine with hair intact in the sap and put it in a plastic baggy. It seemed as though this creature had a habit of preparing these small pines for back scratching posts in an intelligent and consistent manner. I wondered if other bigfoots did this. I completed my journey back to the tent and realized that the pine I had just collected the sample from was only about 100 yards away. If the other depressions I had seen on the way into this area were indeed tracks as I thought they could be  then bigfoot was leaving too much evidence around here to be just passing through. I figured I was camped right smack in the middle of a bigfoot  s backyard. I had gathered about three chords of firewood in the course of the day which I now started using to stoke up a pretty good sized camp fire. The wood burned quickly because of the fact it was very old and dry. About every twenty minutes or so  I would have to put on another log. This kept the fire at just under the bonfire setting. Darkness fell without incident. No bears  no mountain lion and no bigfoots. Wow  if my friends could see me now. Bigfoot Bait! Every few minutes or so I would look up the west logging road and then up the east logging road. The north and south avenues of approach were covered by very heavy brush. I could here a lizard coming toward me from either of those directions so I wasn  t too concerned about them. Actually it would have to be a pretty large lizard to be heard over the snap  crackle and pop of my camp fire. I passed some time by sharpening the ends of my walking stick. I got a chuckle out of the fact that my walking stick was about three feet longer than the one I had started with. The further away from civilization I got the softer I walked and the bigger the stick I carried. Everything I had read about and heard about bigfoots told me that they are not aggressive unless shot at. Since I had no gun that wasn  t a problem  however I did keep the pepper spray ready at all times just in case. I also tried to stay aware of which direction the breeze was blowing because into it the pepper spray had a maximum effective range of only about two feet. I continued to look up and down the two logging roads. My camp site was surrounded by complete darkness. I looked at my watch. It was 11:00pm. If I didn  t see anything by 1:00am I would hit the tent for a good night sleep. A bigfoot could be miles from here. Time dragged on as I occasionally looked up and down the two roads. I was sitting on a short log set in an upright position at a distance of about five feet from the fire. My back was to the fire so that it wouldn  t impede my vision as I scanned the surrounding darkness. I looked into the darkness of the west road then looked into the darkness of the east road. That is when it happened. The hair on my back and neck stood straight up. It was the strongest instinctive reaction I had ever had in my life. I was looking directly into a pair of eyes that were looking directly at me. I didn  t move a muscle. It was a bigfoot. There was no doubt in my mind that what I was looking at was not a bear  mountain lion  owl or a deer. His eyes were set wide apart and well above where I knew the ground should be. I didn  t take my eyes off of them. The Omah  as it is called by the local Indians  was watching me. Something that I had not spent much time thinking about  until right at that moment  was now of prime concern to me. Had anyone ever taken a shot at this creature? Did this creature  for whatever reason  hold any sort of grudge against human beings? I hoped not. Actually it was more like a quick prayer. I did not want him to direct any ill will towards me at all. It most likely would have been about 750 pounds of powerful ill will. He wasn  t moving. I wasn  t moving either  even though my neck was crooked to the left in an uncomfortable position. I watched him and he watched me. The longer I looked into his eyes  the more I got the feeling this was just an intelligent and lonely creature curious to see what I was doing. I began to relax. I had a Mini-Mag flashlight in my left hand and the pepper spray in my right. I wondered if I should shine the flashlight on him to get a look at his body. Again I should point out that this could have been a female  but for the sake of simplicity I will continue to refer to the creature as  he . I opted not to shine the flashlight on him. He came to me  I saw him  and now the ball was back in his court. I waited for him to make the next move. His nocturnal eyes were reflecting the light of the fire I was sitting next to. I tried to make out the outline of his body. I could not. The camp fire illuminated bushes and trees out to a certain distance depending on how recently I had put on a fresh log. Beyond that point of illumination the forest was pitch black. I believe the fire was at a point that a fresh log had just been added when I first looked up and saw Bigfoot. I continued to observe. The right eye (his left)  occasionally seemed to fade in and out as though it was partially blocked by a leaf or branch of the bush I was sure he was standing behind. Earlier  at times when I really had the fire going  the front of this bush would be illuminated for the period of time that the fire was brightest. I couldn  t see the bush now but I was sure of it  s position. As I studied his eyes I got the impression they were wet. Liquidy you might say. An effect probably caused by the flickering of the fire they were reflecting. They were a glossy yellow when I first saw them and faded to a real faint yellow (almost white) toward the end of our staring session. Looking back  I would guess that while paying complete attention to him I had neglected the fire and as the fire lessoned in intensity so did his eyes. Occasionally it looked as though he would blink. His eyes would simultaneously disappear for a fraction of a second. It also looked as though his head was shifting from side to side. Similar  I thought  to what I would do if I was trying to observe someone from behind a bush. His eyes looked to be approximately 4 1/2 to 5 inches apart and almost 1 inch in diameter. Minutes ticked by. My neck was beginning to get sore from the position I was sitting and watching him as he watched me. I casually looked at my watch. It was 12:15am. Then I slowly raised and extended my left arm for the purpose of using my hand as a measuring tool. He didn  t move while I did this. He just kept watching. I used the width of my left hand to measure the distance from his eyes to the top of a lone pine silhouette against the night sky in the background. I made a mental note that his eyes were almost directly under and 2 hand widths below the tip of the lone pine. I also made a mental note not to move the log I was sitting on for the rest of the night. I would use this information when the sun came up. After making these observations  I decided to relieve the soreness in my neck and look at him from another position. I slowly spun around in the direction away from him. I didn  t want him to think I was getting ready to confront him. I looked up and he was still there watching me. I remember wondering if he could tell if I was watching him. The fire was now slightly behind and to the left of me. From his vantage point  I was most likely silhouette by the fire. His eyes were now getting harder to see. They were there but not as bright. My eyes were getting sore from staring. Then I noticed how dark it was getting in my camp. The fire had barely a flame left to flicker. It didn  t take me long to decide that I wasn  t going to sit here in complete darkness with a bigfoot just spittin distance away. I slowly stood up to get another log from the pile that was just out of reach. I positioned the log in the fire and sat back down. When I looked up I could not find his eyes. He was gone. At about 3:15am I thought I could see his eyes again but in a position further back from where he had stood the first time. I was kind of expecting him to come back and see what I was up to. It was hard to tell if he did or not  but I think he did. Time passed slowly as I waited for the sun to come up so I could check for tracks. I  d thought about doing it with a flashlight but rejected the idea. I would see things much more clearly in the morning. As the sun came up I sat in the same position I was in when I had measured his eyes from the top of that lone pine tree. According to how everything lined up his eyes would have been centered at the top of the 8 foot bush that stood 70 feet from where I had been sitting. When it was light enough to see the ground fairly well  I made my way over to the area behind the bush. It was an area that was just to the side of the logging road. The ground was similar to the logging road itself which was hard packed gravel. The difference was that the area where I figured a bigfoot should have been standing was covered in a dry  sparse  wheat type of grass. There they were -- the same size tracks I had been finding all along. The tracks were not much more than the grass being squashed  and I do mean flattened  in the shape of a big padded foot. Narrower at one end than the other and approximately 16 inches long and 7 to 8 inches wide at the front of the track. There was a set of tracks leading to a point exactly behind the bush where they then became less distinguishable as though he had been shuffling around. There was however one depression in the ground at a point close to the bush. I guessed it would have been his right foot that made it by its shape. I stood where it looked as though he had stood and found myself directly behind the bush. I looked up to see that if I was about 2 feet taller my eyes would have been at bush-top level. There was another set of tracks that led away at a slightly different angle than the set that led in. He had come in and left on the east logging road. Nice and quiet. No crashing through the forest. At this point I thought to look for a hair sample around the tracks in hopes of later matching it with the samples I already had. I got down on my stomach and looked. Nothing. I quickly looked over the logging road for more tracks but didn  t find anything. It was very hard packed. Decision time. Do I stay camped here and hope to see a bigfoot in the daytime? This is when I realized I had taken too many pictures the day before and I didn  t have anymore film for the camera. Last time that ever happens. Anyway  Bigfoot is nocturnal and daytime sightings are extremely rare. He would probably be somewhere very well hidden and fast asleep during daytime hours. As I mentioned earlier my plan was to stay thirty days in the bush. But now that I had the hair  excrement and tree samples as well as the pictures of the tracks and the experience of last night. I decided 2 weeks was long enough. I packed everything up and headed out on the east logging road. I was walking at a pretty good pace. Having 17 miles to cover before nightfall with about 60 pounds worth of gear still in my rucksack  I didn  t want to waste any time. I  d only gotten about 75 yards up the logging road when I heard what sounded like an extremely large animal thrashing in the woods at a point next to where I was walking. The noise was so close that I didn  t think I was going to get the pepper spray I wore on my left forearm out of its holder in time to use it. Then I realized it was running away from me. Crashing through the woods I think best describes it. Large branches snapping as it escaped my nearness. As I listened to it  s escape I tried to figure out what it was. It covered a lot of ground very  very quickly. Through the process of elimination I started guessing. The list of possibilities was short because there are not many animals large enough to have possibly made that much noise. The speed suggested a deer but there was no snorting or hoof sounds that I had previously heard from deer running away from me. Nor did the animal in question sound as  fleet-footed  as a deer. The feet were crunching a lot of material underneath them suggesting that they were large surfaced extremities. Could it have been a bear? Possibly  but all the bear I had dealt with to this point were not that afraid of anything. The creature in question was also running away from me on the downhill side of the road and it is my understanding that bear don  t run downhill too well. Things happened very quickly  which made it hard to tell  but it also sounded as though the creature I had heard was not getting away from me in a four legged gallop. There is one thing I am sure of. The noise I had heard was caused by an extremely large and powerful creature that desperately did not want to be that close to me. I will venture to guess that my ole buddy had stayed pretty close to me the whole night and may have even been watching for me the next morning. I call him that because I felt as though we had somehow bonded during my long look into his eyes that night by the camp fire. I had seen his soul and it was a kind soul. My question had been answered.

610,I think it was early September of 1997 when I received an email from Matt Moneymaker asking if I would be interested in investigating a possible recent â€œbigfoot hotspotâ€ in northern California. I was living and working in southern California at the time so it would require some persuasive reasons for me to consider it. Matt provided them. Basically  an active LEO (law enforcement officer) had reached out to Matt claiming he had repeatedly heard powerful vocalizations between two creatures around his remote getaway cabin during the month of August. I didnâ€™t personally interview this person  who Iâ€™ll refer to as John  but Matt had interviewed him  and I trusted that Matt wouldnâ€™t ask me to check it out if he didnâ€™t think it was worth the effort. So  I made arrangements and prepared for a one to two-week expedition to northern California. As I drove north  Matt worked on creating a DVD with the cleaned-up audio of a howl he had previously recorded in Ohio. The plan was for John and me to play Mattâ€™s audio DVD from the cabin in hopes of attracting the curiosity of the two creatures that were making the vocalizations and possibly still living around Johnâ€™s cabin. Shortly after I arrived in NorCal  John and I received Mattâ€™s DVD in the mail. I purchased a DVD player and John dug up a big speaker. John invited his significant other over for our first evening of â€œcall blastingâ€. We set up the DVD player and the speaker on a table in front of the big living room wide open bay window that overlooked a little valley in the middle of some rugged terrain. The living room lights were on as we talked about the possibilities of a response. If my memory serves me correctly  we started blasting out the howl about every 15 minutes starting at about 9pm-ish. About an hour after we started  maybe four call blasts later  as we listened for a distant response  we all heard a strong whistle come from directly in front of the bay window we were all standing by. My initial thought considered the power behind the whistle and how close it was. We all looked at each other with â€œsaucer eyesâ€ when I exclaimed  â€œthatâ€™s a Squatch!â€. Johnâ€™s significant other then blurted out â€œturn out the lights!â€ John turned off the lights and then we all listened and waitedâ€¦ and waited and listenedâ€¦ and listened and waited. Long story short  that was all there was that night. Our excitement faded and we all went to bed. Very early the next morning  John and his significant other headed back to the coast so John could get to work on time. I was left in the cabin to think about what had happened and what I was going to do next. I started by digging some gear out of my SUV. I had purchased a Sony Hi8 video recorder and ITT Night Vision attachment recently and started preparing it for some night work. At the time  it was a pretty hi-tech piece of gear. I put a piece of black electrical tape over the â€œOnâ€ indicator light and then loaded and tested it. Then  when it was fully light out  I walked around the cabin looking for signs of large visitors. This was typical forest so the chances of finding anything of value was not too good. Hair was high on my list to find but I didnâ€™t find any. As I made my way around the cabin looking for signs  an idea popped into my head â€“ foxhole! I was betting we would get another visit in the coming evening and I wanted to be in a position to catch the event on video. I considered a likely avenue of approach  terrain  angles and all those kinds of things before I started digging. The place I picked was across and slightly up the little dirt road that passed by the front of the cabin. I didnâ€™t dig that deep and cut in a little seat that  when I was in seated  would put my eyeballs right at ground level. When John arrived at the cabin that evening  I went over the plan with him. He would blast out the calls while I sat motionless in my foxhole; something I was very familiar with having spent countless hours on ambush and in a foxhole while in the military. Rule number one while in an ambush position is â€“ DONâ€™T MOVE! John liked the plan and offered to blast out the calls from his upstairs bedroom window where he could go to sleep when the urge hit him. He had to get up early again the next morning for the drive back to the coast and another day of work. As day turned to night  I went to the foxhole dressed for a motionless night of cold and John started blasting out calls about every fifteen minutes from his upstairs bedroom window. It sounded loud and pretty cool from where I was sitting. And again  if my memory serves me well  it was only about an hour and a half  plus or minus  minutes later when the call blasts stopped  and the snoring started. With no other noise in the silent forest  Johnâ€™s snoring sounded surprisingly loud. As I sat in my foxhole waiting and listening  a fox walked by on the dirt road not more than about eight feet from my eyeballs. Which  by the way was the only thing I had moved since taking up position in the foxhole. My eyes shifted from side to side with only slight and very slow head movements from side to side to widen my view. The fox sauntered by and never even acknowledged my presence. No  I didnâ€™t make that up to embellish this account â€“ it happened just that way. In fact  we put out food for the fox  cabbage I think it was  a few nights later when the Squatch activity died down. A couple of adults with some young ones  I think. We watched and listened as they ate together. Hearing wild foxes feed at the same food pile is a sound Iâ€™ll never forget. It sounded vicious. I donâ€™t recall the exact time  but it seemed like I had been in the foxhole for a few hours when I started seeing what looked like faint eyeshine on my right  the opposite direction from the cabin. My first thought was that I might be seeing a couple of stars through small openings in the overhead canopy of the dense forest. The terrain fell away into another valley on my right so the angles could be about right for that. I did occasionally see what Iâ€™m sure were stars through the canopy but there were times where the level and location just didnâ€™t seem to add up to be stars. And I donâ€™t recall the phase of the moon but there was some light for sure. The fox that walked by me was fairly easy to see. My memory of the details of this part is fading as the years go by  but I remember thinking that I was leaning towards thinking it was very faint eyeshine based on intervals and shifting positions. As I sat in the foxhole with the turned on and blacked out night vision video camera on my lap  I listened and waited. John had stopped snoring by this time and the night was still and very quiet when suddenly  coming from my left and down the dirt road past the cabin  I heard  what I can only describe as  a moving  powerful  loud  shrill and â€œcrazy whistleâ€. It sounded like it was going to pass right in front of the cabin and into the view of me and my camera. I raised the camera and leaned slightly forward to get the camera up to my eye and around a small piece of foliage on the left side of the foxhole. This all happened in about one to two seconds. As I started bringing the camera up to my face  I remember thinking â€œIâ€™m about to get the money shot!â€. At the same time  I heard a powerful â€œmaleâ€ whistle come from the other side of the little dirt road directly in front of me. It sounded like the source was not more than twenty to thirty feet away! The â€œcrazy whistleâ€ coming from the direction of the cabin stopped immediately. The moment I started filming the front of the cabin is the same moment I realized that the event was already over. It ended as fast as it started thanks to the signaling whistle from the one providing overwatch directly across the road from me. My guess is that the male provided overwatch while the female queried the cabin for a response from one of their kind. I listened and peered into the dark spaces of the forest hoping for some more audio or visual information  but it never came. I didnâ€™t hear or see a thing for the next couple of hours  so I left the foxhole and headed for the cabin and a couple of hours sleep before John left for work. John left early the next morning and  as he pulled away  I went to my SUV to get something. I donâ€™t recall what it was now. I opened the car door and the light came on. It was still really dark out  and the forest was ink black outside of the car light I was bathed in. As I leaned in to get whatever it was that I was after  I heard a very distinct  clear and close chirping whistle directly behind me. It could not have been more than twenty to thirty feet away again. I turned and strained to see something  and  without too much hesitation  I responded with my best impression of the three-chirp whistle I had just heard. I got a chirping response and answered again with my chirping whistle. We did this back and forth four or five times and then it stopped responding. I listened intently for about five minutes but didnâ€™t hear any movement in the bushes  so I finished getting what I was getting  closed the car door  and headed back to the cabin. The nights were cold  and  thankfully  rain had not been an issue so far. I checked the weather forecast every day and on this third day  the forecast was for a dry and very cold night. My foxhole was now known to them  so I decided to just sit on the porch and wait  listen and watch for visitors that night. So  when John arrived at the cabin that evening  he went to his upstairs bedroom to blast calls and I sat outside on the porch by the front door with the video recorder at the ready in my lap. I was hoping to enjoy a little heat emanating from inside the cabin  but I didnâ€™t get any. The porch was on the left side of the cabin giving me a view of the left half of the cabin road and clear line of sight to the foxhole I had spent most of the previous night in. As I recall  John only blasted out the call a couple of times before he fell asleep on the third night. Sometime around midnight I started hearing the faint sounds of a chirping whistle. I strained to listen for direction and distance. Direction was to the front right of the cabin and distance was hard to tell but I guessed it was probably coming from at least a couple hundred yards away. I listened intently as the whistles grew louder. The chirping whistles came in pairs and the pairs were spaced about five minutes apart. The pair of whistles were the same type of whistle  but there was a difference in the tone of the two whistles. It most definitely sounded to me like one was masculine and the other was feminine. Each chirping whistle consisted of three chirps. The first two were the same and the third kind of â€œtailed offâ€. The whistles grew louder as the pair made their way towards the cabin. I would hear what sounded like the masculine whistle first followed immediately by what sounded like the feminine whistle a short distance away and to the side. I would guess they were about a hundred yards apart from each other the whole way. About five minutes would go by where I would hear nothing and then  slightly louder  I would hear the pair of whistles again. This went on for about an hour and a half or so as I sat their thinking wow  thatâ€™s the same thing we did in the military while conducting nighttime reconnaissance patrols. Some units used clickers and some used bird like whistles to communicate and maintain distance between individual team members. But the pattern of their whistles was so regular and obvious that I couldnâ€™t help but consider that they wanted me to know they were on their way. They had been so completely stealthy on the first two nights and now they were telegraphing their approach to then cabin. But why? The whistles eventually got relatively close to the cabin. I guessed they were about fifty yards away when the back and forth chirping stopped completely. Based on what I thought went down the night before  I guessed they stopped whistling when they started performing a 360 degree check around the cabin to see what sneaky surprises might be in store for them. As I sat there on the porch listening and watching  I was pretty sure they were circling the cabin and would very soon know right where I was. I didnâ€™t hear or see a thing for about forty-five minutes. And then the completely silent night was interrupted when  from across the little dirt road in front of the cabin  I could easily hear what sounded like a cow walking through the trees and brush. It was about as loud and un-stealthy as an animal in the woods can be. The noise started and stopped within about a fifteen second time frame and moved from my right to left. And then everything went quiet again. As I watched  listened and waited for something else to happen  I realized that the noise had stopped directly behind my foxhole. The noise maker was in a position that provided a perfectly clear view of me sitting in the darkness on the porch. The distance between us was about fifty feet. Here is another one of those â€œI have to considerâ€ moments when I asked myself â€œdid they just turn the tables on me?â€ And once again  I didnâ€™t see or hear anything for the next couple of hours. The events of that night were over. Thatâ€™s really all that is worth mentioning from this two-week expedition. My take-aways were improved understandings of their stealth  intelligence  sense of play  teamwork  tactics and communication. And  no  I donâ€™t recall any foul odors. ,Near Patrick Creek ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Fall ,6015,yes

613,On 12-22-98 at about 5pm I was driving westbound on Lake Earl Drive approaching Highway 101 controlled intersection.   Because it just finished snowing  my son was admiring a snow-covered area of a mountain that had just been clear-cut. Looking up also  I noticed a human like figure at the top portion of this area. This figure was walking down and appeared to be about 7 or 8 feet tall covered in reddish-brown fur. Not believing what I was seeing  until my son said  oh shit  and both of us continued to just sit there and watch this critter. As it continued down the hill  it stepped up and over a fir sapling  and stopped and looked around. It started walking again (a total of about 400 yards) and disappeared into the forest at the base of the hill. Because both of us were in total shock  we didn  t notice 3 other cars that had pulled over to the side of the road to watch this animal until it had walked out of sight. ,East of Highway 101 just south of Smith River  Del Norte County  California ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Winter ,6015,yes

I have hiked the woods of California all of my life and I have never heard anything like this before. I have heard bear  mountain lion and elk  and this was nothing like those. What impressed us most was how loud it was. We have heard groups of humans in the campground hooping and hollaring and their noise level was not even close to this. We were inside of a travel trailer that had the windows closed up and the noise was clear and strong. We estimated that it had to have come from just across the Smith River from the campground. I decided to make this report after hearing what seemed to be the same kind of sound on a recent rerun of  Sightings   a recording by Matt Moneymaker. ,just across the Smith River from the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park campground ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Winter ,6015,no
616,This report was brought to my attention on Nov. 24  2002. I am posting for the reporting party. John Frietas called me and requested that I investigate a report that he had been contacted about. I contacted the lady  JW  and she took me to the spot where she had found a track. She had found the track on Nov. 19 (Tues.)  2002 while picking huckleberries with her sister. She had noticed a large track (13  X 7 ) in one of the few bare places in the area. I might add that it was just a week since it had rained and the ground was still somewhat soft. She went up to the area and made a cast of the track two days later (Thurs.). The track was found in an area next to the road that had been cut with a piece of heavy equipment to form a waterbar to drain the road. Since there was a slight incline to the drainage the weight of the track appears to have been on the downhill side. The cast also picked up a rock approximately 2 X2  which may have caused the weight of the subject to be on the downhill side  hence the reason for a deeper depression on  the lower side than the place where one would expect it  on the ball and heel area. The local ranger  MS  was going by when she was doing the casting and saw the track. After talking with other people she was encouraged to report the incident. ,Up French Hill Road. ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Fall ,6015,yes
617,I am a fifty four year old man living in San Francisco. I have never had any interest in this subject until this week.  An old friend of mine moved to Gold Beach  Oregon  and I was driving up to see him.  I had never been on Hwy. 101 before  and became nervous driving on the two lane winding roads.  I kept pulling over to let cars in back of me pass. At about 20 miles or so before Crescent City  I pulled off to allow cars to go by  as I went to pull back onto Hwy. 101  I heard the most horrifying scream that I had ever heard.  I screamed myself and ducked down on my seat  looking up next to my Honda CRV  was a filthy looking gorilla (best as I can describe) it instantly ran into the tree line a few feet away  and vanished into the dense brush. I saw it for maybe 3 or 4 seconds at a three quarter profile.  I would say it was 6.6 ft to 7 ft high  with a wedged head  and it had very dirty matted dark brown dull hair.  Strangely enough  seeing the thing didnâ€™t frighten me  but the scream it gave out only a few feet from my open window almost gave me a heart attack. I never heard a noise like that  and I never want to hear it again. ,I stopped at a filling station and the guy told me i was 50 miles from Crescent City... I traveled about 30 minutes up 101 when this occured ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Fall ,6015,yes
618,I was driving home on highway 101  between Orick and Klamath.  I have four high powered off road lights on my Jeep  so about 100 yards in front of me  I saw what I thought was a bear on the side of the road.  When I got to be about 50 yards  the thing stood up  and my lights made a silhouette of what looked like a human. As I got closer  I could see a rough outline. My jeep has three-inch lifts  and this thing was much taller than my roof  which stands a good 6.5 feet.  When I got to be 20 yards from the creature  it took one leap off the side of the road  and into the darkness.  That is when the hair stood up on my neck  and I realized I just saw bigfoot. ,On a hillside  the up side of the hill was on the left side of the road  and the downside was on the right side.

619,It was the last weekend of September during the fall salmon run of fishing season on the lower Klamath River 2001. It was the end of summer  the river was extremely low and I  d just finished cleaning my salmon. It was about 10 oclock at night and I drove up the river to Blake  s river bar.  This is where the road ends. We were sitting in my truck with the windows down when we heard a sound that I  d never heard on the river or anywhere for that matter.  My attention was immediately taken as we could hear an extremely deep howling sound that sounded  something like a whoooooaaahhhh.  I was a little freaked out because I have never heard anything like this.  I remember trying to put a body with the sound and not coming up with anything.  My friend and I looked at eachother and said  what the hell is that?  The hair was raised on the back of my neck and I felt very fearful  even though I knew the thing was across the river. We waited and didn  t say anything and within about 3 seconds we heard the same sound again.  This time it went whooooooahhhhh  whoooooahhhhh  whoooooahhhh  three times. It was a very deep almost like a moaning sound. Immediately after the sound stopped I heard the same noise  except this one sounded like it was coming from up around the corner  about a half mile  and on the other side of what is called Turup flat.  This one sounded more faint because is was coming from on the other side of this densely wooded area where the river bends. It seemed clear to us that they were calling back and forth to one another.  The one on the top of the river called back only twice and the one across the river sounded off about 4 times.  This entire thing only took about 20 seconds and then it was done. I couldn  t really explain what I was thinking or feeling after they stopped but I was very shaken and just sat there for about thirty seconds waiting to see if there was going to be any more sounds.  I turned my lights on after I thought that it was over and couldn  t see anything because the fog was to dense.  We were both sure that we had never heard an animal like this before.  Between the two of us we have about 60 years of night fishing and hunting in this area and this was a first. We both talked about it and felt that whatever it was that they could have come in from either side of the river because the river was so low that it would have been easy to wade across and there wasn  t littel traffic in the area.  The river was also very warm and it was also full of 30-50 pound salmon that were heading up the river. It was a great time to fish if that  s what they doing. ,Drive to the end of Blakes road and go over the Dike down onto the river bar.

620,We were on our long vacation from Missouri  in Crescent City  California  staying at the KOA campground. This was our second night at this campground. We were camped at site 401  way back in the isolated section of the campground  far from anyone. I had just finished cooking our supper on the portable propane barbeque pit  which was located on the picnic table. We both went inside to eat. During the time I was cooking  I set up a camp fire  but didn  t light it yet. After we finished eating  I started the campfire. After the fire was burning for about 15 minutes  I kicked it into the fire pit from the grate. At that time my wife got a very strong feeling that we were being watched from behind our camper. She said it seemed to move (the feeling) from behind the trailer  from one end to the other. There were trees  and dense foliage behind the trailer. I started to look around with a flash light to see what it was  and after not finding anything  I started the car and plugged in the 12v spot light. Looking around for about 5 minutes  I thought I saw something move in the distance  behind a tree. This was in the opposite area from the trailer  where no one was camped at all. We both were shaken up  and went inside the trailer for the night. After 10 minutes my wife heard 2 whoops  coming from the area that I thought I saw something move at. She was in bed lying next to the window. I didn  t hear the sound. One more thing to add  is that the night before we heard dogs bark in the distance  this night it was all quiet no dogs at all. The closet camper was about 100 feet away towards the main office. There was no smell. ,KOA campground located just off of Highway 101  5 miles north of town. ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Fall ,6015,no
621,New to the area in July 2005  I had been traveling from Crescent City  CA over the Pass (Hwy 199) weekly to Grants Pass and back and now in the Winter of 2006  it was 2X weekly.  My wife had not joined me and we were separated and I was attending counseling classes in Medford  OR. We had 5 children and I had my son living with me and he was back at home.  He was about 13. This particular night I was delayed on my return from Medford in the evening (usually arriving back in Crescent City around 1215 AM).  It is roughly an hour from the Tunnel to arrive in either Crescent City or Brookings  OR where I live now. I had stopped @ the Bug Station and rested (because I was delayed in my return) sitting with the heater on and engine idling and doors locked.  The little phone booth shack for Inspections there now  was not there yet.  After closing my eyes about 40 minutes  I  m guessing like 1225 AM  I was rested and awake to get going again back to Crescent City. I use my High Beams because it is so dark through there and everyone does because it is like signaling any opposing traffic of your whereabouts (everyone is usually polite to lower them upon the distance closing). I left the Tunnel and traveled down the hill and began the series of   S   turns through the Pass (it  s like a Canyon and runs adjacent to various sections of the Smith River). I was slowing through the 2nd   S   turn and was watching my headlights and the shadows of the Roadside barriers as they were casting the shadows in the trees along the river. My truck was an older Chevy Dually with a small diesel and it was not a Powerhouse like the newer ones.  I was just cruising with the turns and taking my time.  It had a shell with an 8 foot bed and it was used by a retired couple to tow their trailer so it is kind of slow. The lights are low to the ground and when the high beams are on the go out further and up higher.  You can be seen by anyone else and they can see you from a ways off. As I rounded the turn and was approaching the end of the turn while watching my high beam shadows of the barricade up in the trees  I noticed this BIG Dark Shadow cast in the trees from my lights as I rolled along and my lights lit up a Giant Creature walking along the opposite side  going against traffic- facing away from me.  I said to myself   Oh shit!  and was very excited.  The next part of the turn was coming up right away and I immediately thought to turn around to see it  s face.  I knew it was Bigfoot (Sasquatch) and wanted to see his face but  I was too close still to maneuver around and go the other way and the turn was too shallow.  A thousand things went through my mind   what does he look like  don  t turn around yet  what if he  s hostile  he  ll beat up my truck  don  t turn around here....  The logging trucks fly through there and my slow diesel would have to do a 3 point turn around or more and possibly get T-boned.  I was excited but  also a bit scared.  This was amazing. I kept telling myself  Not yet.  Don  t turn around here.  I kept looking for spots along the rode to turn around   even a little room  because I really wanted to see it  s face.  The mix of it being late  a tight turning canyon  being afraid and also excited - I was bewildered a little...   What do I do?  Almost immediately it was now the small FAST   S   turns (very narrow) that lead to the Narrow passage (it is extremely tight through there and you can see the Tree hanging off the cliff above the roadway in the daytime...  and  this leads to the Resort @ Patricks Creek Lodge). As I passed I was still shaken up and thought what do you do  no one will believe me. As I passed Little Jones Creek I decided to forget about turning around because 1. I had really seen it 2. It was late and no one would believe me anyhow (I did not have a  regular cell phone- it was a cheap Android and off due to no reception- a real long Start-up time when turned on). So  heres what I saw and why I am documenting it. It was over 8   Tall...  I am 6  2  and played Basketball since 4th grade even against 7   players in high school (I was a Leaper and could jump really high- I was 6   when I was 12- stopping my growth @ 15 years old @ 6  2 ).  I could not accurately guess the weight but well over 4-500 pounds- possibly 600  700 or even 800. He had no neck with a Pointed-type head buried between his MASSIVE shoulders...  Huge Shoulders.  I was going slow enough through the turn to see his fingers  toes and palms and foot bottoms as he walked but his hair was like a Llama- matted looking but long and  longer and shorter on different parts of his body.  He was Light Grey to Smokey Charcoal Grey with some Black deeper in beneath his hair closer to his body. The hair was long on his calves  forearms  hands and feet so I just saw tips of long fingers.  His feet bottoms were flipping TOUGH (I  ll spell it TUFF) because they were Wide and what I would describe as Padded.  He walked swinging his harms down near his knees but above them and up right  not hunched over like an ape...  he was walking but just massive- those Shoulders.  I saw him a good 3 - 4 seconds. His Torso was Longer in proportion to his legs  his leg length of Thigh to Calves was not as long as his upper body- he was Huge. I went to work the next day and told a co-worker who had lived up here for over 20 years and an avid hunter and fisherman and he is also part Cherokee so   I know I could trust him.  He has spent countless hours Elk hunting  and bear hunting. He looked at me kind of silly and sluffed it off so I just shut up...   You  ve only been up here about 8 months and you  ve already seen Bigfoot?  I know what I saw. After learning more and now hearing the term Gigantopithecus I looked it up and the Tropical is the one I saw.  Turn the animal around and that is exactly what was   walking   down the roadway. Here  s a link to the picture that convinced me to tell my experience  http //knobbythebigfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gigantopithecus_human.jpg I  m going to start looking for him soon.  If they are active @ night then I  m getting Thermal and Night Vision and want to try and get a video of him. ,Oregon side of Patricks Creek Lodge on the 199 SW of the tunnel [3.3 crow miles NE of the lodge] [41Â°53  39N 123Â°46  58W] ,Del Norte,24,California ,CA,Winter ,6015,yes
622,I think the year was 83 or 84. That year there was a huge mudslide on the south (River) side of Highway 50. I remember because we had to turn around  go back up around Tahoe  and take Highway 80 back to the Bay Area. We were among the first to the slide area  and got out of our truck to look. It was early evening  and  I saw a huge  bi-pedal creature on the slide side of the river. It was on the Tahoe (east) side of the slide  as were we.  It was high on the hill  and appeared to also be regarding the slide. I saw it for about 15 seconds  when it ambled up the hill and out of sight. I have seen many bear  and this was no bear. A bear might rear up  but aside from circus bears  none will walk that way for any length. Even circus bears have an ungainly walk when trying to go on 2 legs. The motion of this creature was much smoother. , ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Winter ,6017,yes
623,My name is (omitted)  I  ve been keeping this secret since around 1986 and didn  t know who I could tell without sounding like a nut  but it  s been bothering me  and I hope you are the appropriate person to contact regarding this matter. Here is what my wife and I saw. During the late summer of 1986 my wife Mary and I were driving east on highway 50 heading toward Lake Tahoe at about 11 30 p.m. We were about 25 to 30 miles west of Lake Tahoe when we approached an S-curve. As we made a right turn  the road curved toward a mountainside and then turned away to the left. While making the right turn however  our headlights were facing the side of a hill and something else  we were not prepared for. About 40 yards directly in front of us  we saw a huge hairy man-like creature walking along the side of this hill at the roadside. Our headlights were directly on it and there was no mistaking what we saw at that distance  as we made the left turn away from the hill the thing disappeared in the darkness. My wife and I stared off ahead  and as we drove a short distance  both turned to look at each other and we said   Did you see that?  I knew I hadn  t imagined it  because she saw it too. Now the problem was who we could tell without sounding crazy  so we never told a soul  but I  ve been searching for the right person to tell because it  s been eating at me for all these years  I hope you are the person I  ve been seeking. Thank you in advance  and by the way  just so there is no question about my sanity  I am a sworn peace officer for the state of California  and just telling you this could ruin my reputation and make me the butt of jokes for the next ten years. - Name Withheld by Request ,On Highway 50  30 miles west of Lake Tahoe. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,yes
624,First I would like to say that I  m very reluctant to tell this to anyone. I didn  t report this because I thought the park service would think we were nuts  and I new of no other source that would take it seriously. I also didn  t think the location of my sighting was one where other sightings had accrued until I used your sightings map. It was April 1993 when I went hiking in Desolation Wilderness with two of my friends for a bachelor weekend. We started out at the Horse Shoe Falls trailhead at Twin Bridges off of HW50 and hiked up to Lake Aloha. It was very hot going up the falls so we were very surprised to se all the snow at the top (that year we had some late snowstorms). We were disappointed because the lake still had a lot of ice on it  but not enough to walk on. We tried to walk around the lake but the deep snow and steep sides male it unappeasable. We set up camp at the south end of the lake 200 yards west of the trail near a picnic bench. We were the only ones up there that fare in except some one that went up the southern slope of eastern mountain. There was no other tracks going around the lake and to my knowledge the back way in was to far to hike in those conditions. Trevor and I woke up early  (near sun up) to try to fish in one of the unfrozen spots near the bank  but it had frozen over that night. We were looking over the lake when we noticed some one on the other side of the lake walking around. We watched him because we didn  t think there was a way around the lake and were curious how he got there. That  s when it walked by the picnic table across the lake and we noticed that it was a lot larger than we were judging were the table came to on it  s leg compared to were our picnic table came to on us (I  m 6ft and Trevor is 6.1ft). That  s when we got out the binoculars and took a better look. We couldn  t ses any detail of its face but its whole body looked dark brown to black. We were arguing about what we were looking at because we didn  t want to believe what were looking at. At first we thought it was a bear but it walk to well on its back feet. We thought it was a hiker but it was not quite walking like a man (judging the long strides by the bench  we could not walk like that comfortley) and how easily it moved across the snow. We went over to the tent to wake up Rob and show him but by the time we got back  he was gone. About 15min. later a lone hiker came down the southern slope of the eastern mountain into our camp and we asked him if he saw any thing on the other side of the lake and he said he watched some thing walking near the lake and then leave out through the north west side. We asked him if he saw any way we could get to that side and he said he could not see a way over. We told him about what we saw and he noticed the same thing (but not the same detail) we did. The sighting was about 10 minutes or so  and has left us a lot to think about. I don  t know if it was a Big Foot or not  but after watching the famous video of the Big Foot walking  I noticed that that  s the strange way we saw the  thing  moving.  ,The north end of Aloha Lake in Desolation Wilderness ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Spring ,6017,yes

626,I have recovered a foot print last year (July 17th I believe ). The print does not really match what a big foot print would look like according to some research that I have done after I found it. It is 22     long  and has what appear to have sharp nails that are claw like in appearance. It resembles a human foot almost with the exception of the size  claws and the contours to it are quite different than a human print. I found the print near a small stream about 10 miles north and east of Placerville  CA. There were several prints in the area and tree branches that were broken along the stream. Only one print was worth looking at so I took some pictures of it. The next day I went back to the area and took a plaster cast of it as well.. I took the print to the Fish and Game to see if it was perhaps just a bear print or something. They thought it was a joke. I put the print in my closet and it has been there ever since. I doubt that I will ever do anything with it  but thought that if you are interested in looking at it sometime I would be happy to share it with you if you think it would be of some help to you.

627,At our home south of South Lake Tahoe  we have been hearing tell-tale screams for the last three months. I have several recordings of these screams  and have been in coordination with three of the curators involved with the BFRO for northern California. Suffice it to say that almost nightly  we have been witness to a resounding number of screams/wails which have not been attributable to coyote nor other  known  forms of animal call/sound.  The sounds have occurred from 9 00pm through 7 00am in the morning on a consistent basis.  I have made several recordings  mostly from my bedroom window. We have made several all-night forays into the forest in an attempt to capture the sounds. My brother and I have made extensive backpacking trips into the wilderness surrounding this area in an attempt to pin down the most likely locations for activity  and we feel we have narrowed it down very well (based upon our normal reception of sound and habitational demographic...) I have found tracks in this area which i have photographed as well as  beds  with torn branches/etc. which may very well be attributable to bear activity  although the screams at night are definitely not.  Areas in question are well off of the beaten path. Description   A mournful wail. Sounds like a locator beacon (like a sonar  ping ) usually answered by another of lower pitch  and both seem to converge at some point--after which both cease to sound.  We (my brother and I) have noticed coyote howls interspersed with the  other  sounds.  We have thoroughly explored the areas surrounding our location  some of which our dogs refused to enter.  We  ve camped out all night with bait  only to give up and head in to hear them after we  ve been tucked away for a good thirty minutes--leaving us dead tired with no  substantial evidence . ,south of South Lake Tahoe ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,no
628,Well me and my friend were hiking through the sierra nevadas until we heard a walking through the brush. I wasnt sure what it was but when i looked to my left i saw this big hairy creature it smelled as a garbage can. It had yellow eyes and was walking away. I tried to get a picture but it was moving in and out of trees. Later on in the night we heard a moving noise outside. my friend said it was a deer but i think it was the creature. ,You take a hike from wrights lake to desolation wilderness and from their at lake schmidel ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,yes
629,During the second week of July 2000 my son (16 years old then) and I had backpacked into the northern part of Desolation Wilderness from the Loon Lake Trail head in Eldorado County  California. Desolation is located in the El Dorado National Forest.  To get to the trailhead you take Hwy 50 east out of Placerville and turn off on the Crystal Basin Lakes Road. Follow this road about 20 miles to Loon Lake and the Desolation Wilderness Trail head parking lot. From the trailhead we hiked into Rockbound Lake and camped near the outlet of the lake which goes down to Buck Island Lake. We stayed there for four days. This is a place that we backpack into quite often and are very familiar with the area. We usually set up a base camp at Rockbound and then day hike and fish at several lakes in the area as well as the Rubicon River.  Desolation Wilderness is just west of Lake Tahoe and the Pacific Crest Trail. On our third night there we sitting in camp.  We had fished until dark and it must have been about 9 30 or 10 30PM. It stays lite very late in the summer and we usually fish until dark. At that time we heard a very loud scream that came from the northeast shore of the lake. A few seconds later we heard two more loud screams that came from the same direction. These screams were very loud and not like anything that we had ever heard before. My son and I have both heard mountain lions scream before but these were much louder and very high pitched. We knew that the screams were to loud to be a bird and really didn  t know what they were. At that time we didn  t even think that it may be a bigfoot. We had both heard about Bigfoot but it wasn  t something that came to mind when we heard the screams. Shortly after the screams we went to bed and didn  t hear anything else. The next morning I got up just before daylight so we could pack up and hike back to Loon Lake before it got to hot. My son was awake but still in our tent.  At this time we both heard the biggest loudest roar that was nothing like we had ever heard before. This roar came from the south end of the lake. My son quickly got out of the tent and we just started to ask each other what it was when there was another loud roar from across the lake. About ten seconds later there was another loud roar from way up in the Rubicon River canyon which was about 2 miles away. This roar was muffled because of the distance but was still loud enough to hear. About five seconds later there was another loud roar that came from where we had heard the screams the night before. Five seconds later there was a very  very  loud roar that came from about 50 yards or less behind our camp.  At that time my son and I turned and ran over a small hill behind our camp to see if we could see anything. The area behind camp was fairly open with alot of granite and brush and a few trees. At that time we really didn  t know what we were looking for but we thought that we might be able to see something. We hiked around the area and over to a snow pond but didn  t see or hear anything else. At that time we returned to camp  packed up our stuff and started to hike  back to Loon Lake.  On the hike back we talked quite a bit about what we had heard and were joking that it was probably several bigfoots communicating with each other. I guess we really didn  t want to believe that we had heard a bigfoot but we both knew that there is no other animals in the woods that can make the type of screams and roars that we had heard. A few days later I drove back to the El Dorado National Forest Ranger station at Camino  Calif. and asked a couple of employees at the counter if they had ever had anyone report hearing any loud roars or screams in the Desolation Wilderness area. One of the employees told me that someone else had reported hearing some loud screams a few weeks earlier. I then told the employees what my son and I had heard and one of them said it sounds like a bigfoot to me.  They also told me that there was someone at that office who takes reports on possible bigfoot happenings and I left my name and number but never heard from anyone. Over the next couple of years my son and I had told several people about what we had heard but really didn  t find anyone else who had heard the same thing.  Most people we talked to had no reason not to believe us but really had no idea how loud the screams and roars were. By this time we both began to believe that we had heard several bigfoots communicating with each other but really had no way to prove it. A friend of mine then told me about the BFRO Wedsite and we logged on and found out that there were other hikers that had reported actually seeing a couple of Bigfoots in the Desolation Wilderness not very far from where we had camped. We talked about submitting a report but never got around to it. A couple of months ago the same friend gave me a video tape of the Discovery Channel show about Bigfoot. When I heard the recordings of Bigfoot screams I knew then that we had heard the exact same thing. The only difference was that the screams we heard were louder.  Probably because we were actually hearing them naturally and not on a tape. About a month later my son was able to view the Bigfoot video and when he heard the screams he said  Dad thats exactly what we heard.  We listened to them several more times  and agreed that we would submit a report. There has never been any doubt in our minds that the screams and roars we heard could not have come from any known animal species that lives in the Sierras. We both wanted to believe we had heard a Bigfoot but really had nothing to compare it to until we heard the screams on the Discovery Channel video tape. My son was raised in the Sierras and I have lived there for 20 years so both of us are quite familiar with the local animals and sounds. I am also a wildlife biologist and know that the sounds we heard could not have come from a bear or mountain lion. We both now believe that the sounds we heard came from several Bigfoot type creatures or at least an animal that has not currently been identified.  ,See above report. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,no
630,Well about 2 years ago  I heard strange noises while camping at Suger Pine Campground.  I heard  whooping  sounds and long  wails  coming from the forest behind me.  They scared me  so I ran into my trailer with my dad and step mom.  I didn  t know that this could be a Bigfoot until just last week end  when I found out that I was going to be camping this summer at Smith River (I heard that the most recent sighting was 8 months ago). I came to this website and read about the sightings in the Sugar Pine area and heard the Bigfoot screams.  I realized that was the sound that I heard and it was in fact the famous wails and whooping sounds of sasquatch!  Bigfoot does exist!  The next year (2001; I go every year) I found what looked like humungus human tracks but with only 4 toes (I am not positive they were related to Bigfoot though). ,It was thick and foresty  lot of tall pine trees. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,no
631,On Saturday night Sept 23  2000 (last night) my wife and I were on our way back form dinner and were driving south on HWY 89 just south of Tahoma (west side of Lake Tahoe)  about 100 yards north of the Sugar Pine Point State Park Campground turn off when my headlights illuminated what appeard to be a furry animal crossing the road. When it saw our vehicle approaching it began to run from the center of the road to the other side into the trees as we passed. The general motion was from right to left heading west to east toward the lake form the campgroud area.  The strange thing was that it was clearly not a bear or any kind of four legged animal. It had a distinkt two legged run as I would expect a human to have  but was covered with hair (or fur) that was much longer than that of other furry animals and had a rust colored hugh to it. It ran slightly bent over and had medium hight (5-6  ). It happened too fast to make out special features like feet  hands or the shape of the head. I could only see the running form of the body. The first thing that I thought was that it looked like a big foot  but was hesitant to suggest that to my wife. She in her exitement pointed to it and began to say  look at the bear  but stopped up short. I told her that I didn  t look like that to me.  She was the one who suggested that it  really looked more like a Sasquatch  and at that point I know that we had both seen the same thing. A few reflections  1. I would prefer to believe that it was just a prank by some fun seeking camper  but it was very real. This animal did not run or move as I would expect a human to run or move. What we saw was not a prank. 2. I can  t think of a reason why anyone would go to that much work to fool a motorist for no apparent reason. 3. I have been a bit of a sceptic until yesterday  but we saw what we saw. I  ve been unable to find any other expanation for it. 4. As one might expect  we were unable to get a photograph and will have to live with our rememberance. I hope that this may help you or other who are keeping track of sightings. ,West Lake Tahoe just north of Sugar Pine Point State Park Campground ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Fall ,6017,yes
632,It was a clear night. There was a full moon and it was about 10 00. We were camping out in Sugar Pine State Park. All of the sudden  there was a loud whooping noise. It sounded close by. Then  we heard a loud crunching  like branches breaking. It couldn  t have been a bear  it was too big. In the morning  we saw some footprints by our tent that were about 12-16 inches long. They were much too big to be a bear  s. We still dont know what it was  but we are about 90% sure it was Bigfoot. ,At the Sugar Pine Campground next to Lake Tahoe. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,no
633,My husband and I were out quading up by Stumpy Meadows  that is up out of Georgetown  California.  I have lived in that area for roughly 40 years.  I have smelt some awful smells up there in the woods.  This day my husband and I rode down this one road and found out it didn  t go anywhere  so we turned around and rode back out.  I went out ahead of him  I got far enough ahead that I couldn  t see him when turned to look to see if he was following.  Anyway I stopped to wait for him. I thought I smelt someting dead  or  like something peed there more then once. It was a really strong smell.  My first thought was a bear.  While  I was sitting there looking around I got this wierd feeling that some one was watching me.  I was really getting scared  I always carry a 44 mag with me  so I figure I can be pretty much safe when I  m out there  but not this time.  I decided to go find my husband  as I started my quad up I heard a branch break.  I  m still thinking bear  but the smell was awful. I started to pull away and I looked down and there over the tracks we made earlier going down the road were the biggest footprints I have ever seen  then I knew that was no bear. I took off  I got about ten feet down the road when my husband pulled up.  He looked at me and said what  s up?  you see a snake? So I showed him the tracks. Now my husband is the type of guy that would have to be knocked down by a bigfoot before he would believe.  Then still he would say it was something else. He said that because the road was so dusty that the prints  looked larger then they actually were.  He said he didn  t smell anything but a faint smell of something dead.  I wanted to believed him.  I never went back to that area again. ,Down one of the many cow trails that lead away from Stumpy Meadows Lake. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Fall ,6017,yes
634,My wife  my two children  and I were driving on Hwy 50  west bound  leaving South Lake Tahoe at 9 55 PM.  We just passed the agriculture inspection station in the town of Meyers  CA  when both my wife and I saw simultaneously a large animal crossing the road about 100 yards in front of us.  I thought it was a bear but wasn  t sure.  So I asked my wife.  Her response was most unusual. She said that she saw it walking on two legs and that it looked like a monkey  about 5 1/2 feet tall  with light brown fur.  She has better eye sight than me so I questioned her further.   What else did you notice   I asked  very curious.  She said that it had walked rather slowly  across the road  and that it was definately an animal  like a monkey  and walked like a monkey would walk. It disappeared into the trees  before we could get close enough for a better look.  I wanted to turn around and look some more but my wife didn  t want to.  So we kept driving.  That  s when I had a chance to question her more. My wife has had Laser surgery on her eyes  and I wear corrective lenses  which  most unfortunately I wasn  t wearing at that moment.  This is why she was able to see better than me. , It  crossed Hwy 50 close to Upper Truckee River.  I can pinpoint the location because Hwy 50 crosses Upper Truckee River.  I know the area  well  I want very much to look for tracks in this area. But I live in Sacramento and I  m too busy right now. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,yes
635,The weekend of August 16th my family and I went camping on Union Valley lake.  We had three tent sites about a 100 yards from the shore. On Saturday night my 2 year old son had trouble sleeping and kept me up.  I  m guessing it was around 1 or 2 am because of where the moon was.  About 200 yards to the south of our site in the woods this very loud and drawn out scream rang out.  I immediately stopped moving to try and see if I could hear any movement.  Then  from the west across the cove  the same sound responded.  The scream from the west continued at least 15 to 20 times.  There were other campsites and I remember seeing someones shadow as they walked to the bathroom.  The screams got louder and the individual hurried to the bathroom letting the door slam behind him.  The screams stopped and did not return.  My wife and two kids slept through the whole thing which surprised me considering how loud the scream was.  The next morning I asked my father-in-law and my wife  s uncle  who were in the other sites  if they heard the screams. Both them and their wives heard them as well.  My father in-law  and my wife  s uncle thought it might have been a group of coyotes  but we all agreed that we never heard anything like that before in our lives.  I can usually immitate any sound  but this scream was impossible for me to mimic. It was too loud for me to do.  I have listened to all of the audio that I could find and the recordings in Pallyup Washington are similar. ,Campground on Union Valley Lake.

636,I am posting this report after several months of trying to dismiss what I saw as a bear or other common animal. I have come to the conclusion that what I saw could only have been an unknown animal such as Sasquatch  as the behavior and curiosity of the animal does not match any animal I am aware of  yet is consistant with Sasquatch descriptions I have read on this and other web sites. I had heard recent reports of black bear sightings becoming more common in the Pollock Pines area and that the bears are extending their range from the Rubicon/Desolation Wilderness area south to Pollock Pines. Two black bears had recently been hit and killed on Highway 50 about 3 miles north of my encounter. All this talk of bears in our area is what led me to initially conclude that what I had seen was a bear. Approximately 5 30am sometime in early fall I was travelling northbound about 45mph on Sly Park road heading toward Highway 50. It was almost completely dark  there was some light starting to become visible  there where no other vehicles. I rounded a sharp corner to the left going downhill when my highbeams hit a large animal on the left side of the road  it was standing on two legs and was facing to the left. It appeared to be grabing at something in the trees in the front yard of a residence. As soon as my light hit the animal it quickly turned 180 degrees to it  s right in a twisting motion going down on all fours and proceding to run on all fours to the other side of the road. The right side of the road had thick brush which at that time appeared to be about 3 feet tall. The right side of the road also opens into thick forest land. Upon first seeing the animal I slowed down to about 25mph to be sure this large  bear  got across the road without me hitting it. As I drove past the location where the animal had entered the brush I looked out the passenger window and to my surprise I saw it  s face in the brush looking right into the window only a few feet away. I saw large reddish brown eyes  a large brown head and a dull black (not shiny) area that would have been the nose. I did not see ears and since it was looking straight on  I was unable to discern a flat or pronounced snout. In retrospect the face appeared to convey an emotional look of concern or panic. During the encounter I did not consider the animal to be anything other than a bear until several minutes later when I thought it was odd that the animal would cross the road to escape then stop just inside the brush to watch me pass. I would think a Bear would continue to run into the forest. Even with this curious behavior I continued to assume it had been a bear. I was shocked into reconsidering my expanation a few weeks later when road crews cleared the brush away revealing that the brush was growing on a drop off that was 5 feet lower than the road  making the brush 8 feet tall. This would rule out the animal being on all fours while looking into my passenger window. The animal had to have stood up again immidiately after entering the brush to reach the hight required to look into my window  that would place the animal at approximately 8 feet tall. Is it likely that all the behavior I have described can be attributed to a bear  not likely in my opinion. , ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Fall ,6017,yes
637,I wanted to comment on your report case #8595. My parents live in Sly Park. They are at the edge of the National forest. I have heard sounds late at night along with my brother who lives there. Last summer was the last time. But more importantly I have some photo  s that I would like you to see.

638,i went fishing with my girlfriend at stumpy meadows last winter. we been up their about five days out of the week. early in the morning we would arrive try to get the line in the water as much as possible. the rest of the time i would be looking for gold. we mostly stuck around the dam and the spillway. my gold fever and wanting to catch a trout with my fly poll got me to wonder down along the spill way. the hole time i couldnâ€™t shake the bad filling i had well we had. it was the hair on the back of your neck being watched felling. i was at the vary bottom of the spillway in the middle of the stream standing on a rock fishing. my girlfriend was about twenty feet away panning. she said something lick lets get otta here somethingâ€™s watching us. i told her i was catching it for awhile now to. so we climbed out of our little spot and onto a service rode that ran along the spillway. the hole time rubbernecking left right and especially behind us .some thing was putting the creep on us and was getting closer. we were walking as fast as you could without running or looking like you were scared sh**liss .but we both knew if one or the other broke and made for the car you might be last. so we held our ground and walked as casually as could be. i informed her that something was up on the other side of the spillway the hole time we were their watching us. and it was keeping pace with us as we made our way up the steep road. the thing behind us came from down bellow us on the same side of the stream and it was following just far enough not to be seen. we would stop it would stop. im a native american from auburn  and some of my relatives live in foresthill. and ive spent many nights with my cousins hunting though hills. Iâ€™ve been followed by mountain cities a couple times. so i know the experience when thatâ€™s the case. this was not the case sadly  if you were there you could say sadly  i would much rather a cat follow me somehow. but just in case it was a cat driving us or not. i told her to lock and load. that usually does the trick for the hiby jibys but not this time. the things present made my firearm fill like it was a rubber band and folded paper  and extra weight for when she bolted before me to the car. the last twenty feet to the car was easy. the thing had stopped about seventy feet before the car i stood watch as she loaded the car in record speed. a inflatable two man canoe four fishing poles ice chest  tackle  fit in the back set of my camero some how in thirty seconds. we pulled out of the entrance way and on to the road in the middle of the dam. it was dark by now  no cars nothing all day. we got out to gather ourselves and unload and put away the pistols  while she did that i walked back towered the spillway something big and black came up and around the spillway and up the other side of the hill were the other thing was. i was about one hundred feet from were they were. i didnâ€™t feel the fear as before. in a gap between some cwaycky brush one large thing and two smaller things followed. i yelled â€œheyâ€ loudly. the things gurgled some what back at me. they kept this up as they walked up over the hill from me. it was some what like four quick gereag gereag gereag gerags  than lick two than a couple more. than they some what repeated the same sequence again. all the while  walking up over the crest of the hill  into the darkness. it reminded me of a mother giving me a tongue lashing or her children one after a close call. well thats what i related it to  but what was fact is it was talking something. im not to certain on the right number of individual words there were but it definitely was in some sort of sentence structure  stopped than repeated again. ,the dam or reservoir  what ever you call it  has a road running over the top of it. coming from gorgetown going to loon lake you would start going over the dam before you cross it you go over the spillway. a big cement canal runs down the back of the dam down into a cannel. on side has a shear face the other has an access road leading down along the spillway to the bottom. a maintenance road you might say. but at the top of the road has a gate with a lock. but its enough to park a car of the road. if a ranger came we would of surly gotten a ticket. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Winter ,6017,yes
639,We were at Lake Tahoe the first week of may this year - 2005.  While walking on the beach looking for pretty stones  my friend noticed this print in the beach gravel.  What really caught our eye was the depth of the print (3 inches) and how the stones on the bottom had been incredibly compressed as if done by a great weight.  Other prints were visible  but not as good as this one. We were south of Tahoe City  and north of Sugar Pine Campground. ,We were south of Tahoe City  and north of Sugar Pine Campground. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Spring ,6017,no
640,I used to live in Camino  CA and would go up into Desolation Wilderness as often as I could. The trout fishing was really incredible and it left a wonderful lasting memory with me. Since moving from the area  I hadn  t been there in several years. I talked to a friend of mine about going up and camp overnight and do some stream fishing. He agreed and also invited another friend along for the ride. We got up there in the early afternoon and hiked upstream from Wright  s lake and then set up camp. A couple hours later a ranger came by and informed us that we hadn  t actually made it into Desolation Wilderness yet  and that we needed to keep hiking for a while. We broke camp and then the 2 guys that were with me  suggested that we go into Placerville and get a room. Apparently they weren  t up to camping and fishing after all. I said no thanks and that I wanted to come up here  to come up there and fish  not go party somewhere in town. So they left and I went up the hill farther. The ranger had suggested a great camping and fishing location  but because it was starting to get later in the afternoon  there was no way I would make it all the way before dark. He gave me a general location of where it could be found and what trails to take to get there  but when most of the area is large (football field size) sheets of granite  the trails are only marked with stacks of rocks and they are few and far between. I ended up getting lost a bit  but I could hear the stream flowing over rocks to the north of me. I walked in another half mile or so and located the stream. Below me about 35 feet down a granite cliff was a stream that did have a pool in it  right on the tree line. I thought what a beautiful place that would be to have a campsite and then picked my way down the steep cliff side. I set up my camp directly next to the pool and also with the treeline and some very dense woods about 6 feet away to the north. The pool was on the east side of me. I started fishing as soon as my tent was back up and had a gorgeous finish to a very nice day. Then after it got dark  I climbed into my sleeping bag looking to the east to the Crystal range  I think it is called  and watched as the glow of a full moon worked it  s way up over the top of the granite mountains. Once it was over  my day was complete and I decided to go to sleep. That was at 10 30 pm. As I started to drift off to sleep  I heard what can only be described as a very low rumbling growl. When I go into a wilderness area  especially a place I know has bears really thick  I always carry a handgun with me. On this occassion it was a .45 compact. When I heard the growl  it really scared the crap out of me  because it was so close. I jumped up  with my .45 in hand and looked out the top of the screen mesh on the tent. I could see a dark mass about 4 1/2 feet tall  right at the edge of the tree line  6 feet from my head. I yelled some really loud obscenities and started climbing out of my tent. Once I was clear of the door I brought up my pistol and fired into a dead tree a few feet away from what I thought was a big black bear. As soon as the pistol went off  it turned and ran back into the brush  but it didn  t seem to go very far and that concerned me. Bears will usually run like heck and for a long time when they get a shot that close. This seemed to go maybe 50 feet or so into very thick brush. I could hear it thrashing about as it moved deeper into the trees  but then it just stopped. It all went quiet for about 15 minutes or so and then I tried going back to bed. Shortly after I started hearing what sounded like somewhat large rocks  hitting in the water  just above the pool I was camped beside. It would happen every couple of minutes or so. It was the sound of not only the splash  but also of the rock hitting other rocks  submerged in shin deep water. That  cracking  sound. This really concerned me  thinking the  bear  may be circling my campsite and trying to get at me from a different angle. I got out out my tent on several occasions  and was trying to see if I could make out any movement on the other side of the stream but nothing. I usually keep a small flashlight in my tackle box  which I had  but it was one of those small  shake it  and it charges up the cell and lights up for a few minutes. Not much of a flashlight really and worse yet  the handle is clear and so when I would turn it on  the handle would light up too  actually making it harder to see. I had a full moon though and the area is surrounded with stark white granite slabs  and so except in the darkest of the woods  I could see pretty clearly. This went on like this until 2 00 am. That was when I got another  visit . I didn  t get to see it  this time  but I heard movement really close to my tent again  same place as the first time  and when I yelled at it  I got a return of something that sounded like an  Ooof   Ooof   but really deep sounding. I jumped out of my tent again thinking I was going to see it again  but didnt. Still  I put another shot into the dead tree and off it went crashing through the brush again. Again it only went about 50 feet back. There was something odd about the way it sounded when it was running too. I didn  t catch what it was though until I listened to the footsteps of a bipedal walking from your site here. It was only on two feet!! It concerned me enough to realize that it didn  t sound like a 4 legged animal at the time  but I didn  t know what was different until I heard your recordings. Anyway  still thinking I was dealing with a rogue bear  I started trying to figure out what it wanted with me. Was I camped on it  s trail to the water? Was it used to finding food in tents? Desolation is a very high traffic place. This particular place was a ways off the trail and it didn  t appear to have much in the way of hikers. Hikers usually leave some kind of sign  trash  fish hooks  something to say that they were here before  but this place was very clean. So I decide to take my sleeping bag out of the tent and move over to the middle of this big slab of granite that I am on. There is about a 4 foot tall ledge facing the woods where all the activity was going on. But now the treeline is 50 feet away and not 6. Figuring this would give me some advance warning if I got charged. The rocks kept flying  and I kept trying to sleep with one eye open  hoping the sun would come up soon  and checking my watch all night long. Then  she  showed up. It was 4 40 am and something woke me. I heard movement at the tree line again and I looked to where it all started from. I didn  t see anything but then I looked at my tent. Standing right next to my tent was the  creature? . My tent is about 4 feet tall maybe a little less and what I saw was more than twice as tall. At first I couldn  t see any features  just the outline. Then it took a couple of steps towards me. I almost pee  d my pants right there. I picked up the .45 and took a shot off to the left of it. It stopped and looked at me. Then it started walking towards me again. It was very fast. I don  t mean that it was running  it  s just that the steps were so big  the distance was closing very fast. Had it been a bear  I would have shot it immediately  but honestly  I don  t think my .45 would have been able to stop it. One shot would definitely not killed it or stopped it in its tracks. Then as it was approaching me  I took another shot  but this one much closer. I could see it very clearly at this point and yes I did pee my pants. The second shot made her stop again  and then she took off running to the northwest through an area of mostly granite slab and dotted with scrub pine. This was the last time I saw her. She ran off out of sight at great speed. I stayed up the rest of the night until it got light enough for me to hike back towards Wrights Lake to the South West. For the remainder of the darkness I pretty much stayed put with the ledge to my back and my gun in my hand  and shaking in my skin. I have not been able to sleep right since then  and for the next couple of months after the incident  I couldn  t sleep at all. Everytime I closed my eyes  I would hear the growls and the rocks splashing and then see her coming at me. I would be willing to take someone back up there to show where it happened  but only during daylight hours. I have been a hunter and fisherman most of my life and have seen what I thought  was every animal in the woods at one time or another. Nothing like this has ever shown it  s face before  and I hope it never does again. There was another incident however. On December 13th  1992 up in Snow Mountain Wilderness area  above Elk Creek California. I would be willing to talk to someone about this also. ,trail from Wright  s Lake to Enchanted Pools ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,yes
641,After fishing small stream off Ice House Rd. and driving back on Wentworth Springs Rd. just past Stumpy Meadows campground I stopped at the overflow concrete runway on the dam. I looked to my left to the lake area that is roped off for the runway. It was just starting to get dark between 8 30pm - 8 45pm  I checked my watch after the incident.  I felt the urge to put my cordless spotlite on and look to my right down the concrete runway giving it a quick glance my urge told me to look to the left into the trees  that is when I saw a pair of the biggest red eyes glowing back at me that I have ever seen. We watched each other for 2 minutes it then moved sideways and it was at this time I could see it  s outline in the fading light. It was standing upright as it moved behind a tree  when it moved there was another pair of red glowing eyes but much smaller  I must rephrase and say shorter than the original outline. ,I was heading towards Georgetown and stopped on the dam at Stumpy Meadows where the concrete overflow runway is. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,yes
642,Last weekend my girfriend and I went to join her family at Sugar Pine Point in El Dorado County next to Lake Tahoe for a camping trip. On the early morning hours of Saturday July 22nd I was awakened by a strange whoop/howl. I immediately woke my girlfriend up and asked her to listen with me. We were sleeping in a tent. The howl we heard was not close to us. It was at a distance but was very loud. My girlfriends   aunt and uncle were sleeping inside a camper trailer about 50 feet away from us and they said they heard it pretty clear. They have been camping there for years and we all agreed that it was something none of us have ever heard. The whoop/howl lasted 3-4 minutes with short intervals of rest. At one point during the whoop/howl  it almost sounded like there was two  animals/things  making this strange noise. ,It was at Sugar Pine Point camp ground  right off of Highway 89.

643,Today  August 23  2007  I was hiking off-trail in El Dorado County  California in the forest 60 feet north of the Bryan Meadow trail  when at about 10 30 a.m. I saw a tall dark figure peering around a large red fir stump. This was from perhaps 100 feet away  I quickly walked up to the stump  but there was no one there. It would have been possible to move uphill away from me using the large stump as cover  but only a very athletic person could have managed this in the time available. Moving then uphill and to the SE  I regained the Bryan Meadow trail and there noted a large footprint  which I photographed next to my two-way radio. It is about twice the length of my foot  (a size 12 boot size). I do not know the source of this print  but it was where the rapid retreat occurred. I had just parked at the Sierra Ski area (Short Stuff run)  and begun walking up the forest north of the trail to Bryan Meadows. I was moving quietly and slowly  crossing from the north side of the stream to the south without being on any trail. Another biologist was still moving up the canyon on the north side of the stream  but was well ahead of my position. It could have been a human  but the person would have to have been wearing all uniformly dark clothing and had a dark complexion or been wearing dark paint. Head to knee  the figure was a uniformly dark hue and no other detail was discernable  except that the shoulders were slightly more narrow than the average person would be  and the height was at least 6  -3  to 6  -5 . The figure was peering at me from the west end of the stump  leaning forward  so that all above the knee was visible. The figure was of a uniformly dark color  perhaps black. ,From US Highway 50  turn south at Sierra at Tahoe Rd.   enter the Sierra Ski Resort and ask permission to 4x4 to the  Short Stuff  run.  From there the site is less than a mile. Otherwise it is a stiff uphill trek from the  corral  trailhead in Sayles Canyon. To get there turn right (downhill) just before the black Ski Area metal gate  past the green and orange gate  to the trailhead. From Highway 50  this trailhead is 3.5 miles. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,yes
644,Tonight me and my husband were driving on Hwy 50 and we noticed a 8 to 10 foot hairy creature on the side of the road just standing there looking at us while we were driving home... We have driven that Highway enough to know that this was not usual thing to see. We have seen several deers only  but I couldn  t believe what we just seen... I will never drive that Highway at night ever again... It really scared me... I am just curious if any other drivers noticed this big creature on the side of the road..

645,I live in the  Bay Area  of California. My visual sighting is at the bottom of this report. I have photos of that I want to send. I enjoy hiking and camping on a regular basis year round. I have been considering submitting a report for my encounter over the last few months and finally I am doing it. My encounter happened about 4 months ago in July. My girlfriend and I were  dispersed camping  (which is where campers can legally set up a tent in the national forest for free for up to 14 days) in El Dorado National Forest off of Hwy 50  about 6 miles east of Bridal Veil Falls. We have a secluded spot we always return to on the bank of a 10-15 foot wide  4-5 feet deep (at the deepest) river. Some time in the night  probably 1-4 AM  my girlfriend woke me up saying she heard someone jumping into the river about 50 feet away  and it sounded like the person  s legs were sloshing against the water the way it would sound if you were walking fast through thigh-deep water. Sure enough  a few seconds after she whispered this to me  I heard the noise too. She was accurate in her description of the sound. I guess my protective instincts kicked in because without hesitation I unzipped the tent with my large mag-light in hand  (the type police officers use) and stood outside my tent  spotlighting the river bank and the forest around us. I saw nothing  so I called out that there were people and please go the other way  still heard nothing. After that we didn  t hear any more unusual sounds. What struck me as odd was  why would anyone be walking in FREEZING cold (likely glacier run-off) water in the dark morning hours  not anywhere near any trails  and not anywhere near any roads...? (We had to hike to this spot and it  s a mile from our car  down a very steep heavily forested hillside full of underbrush  which is why this spot was so hard to find and it was an accidental find  and why it stays secluded.) It had me pondering for the last few months and even brought me to considering maybe it was a bigfoot because it sounded like two legs  not the way a bear would sound trudging through the water. Plus  there was nothing in the river I could see so whoever or whatever would  ve had to be farther than we thought and therefor very large to make sound seem so close... The next morning we went for a long hike as it was our last day camping. We had just gotten back to the car when I looked back at the treeline we had just came out of a  sort of  for a last glance  I will miss you  type of look  and I saw what I first thought was a black bear in the very top (the literal tip) of a 60-70 foot pine tree  it was staying still but I could see it was wiggling a little  almost like it was positioning itself comfortably  and it looked like it was hugging the tree like a bear. But then I saw the second  bear  in the SAME spot as this one in a tree right next to it. At this point I  m about 500 feet from these things and the trees they were in. I was able to take many photos of these  bears  and I have them on my phone and will send them to anyone who wants to see. On closer inspection  these were not bears. I showed a few friends and family and they all see what I see  it appears there is a UNIFORM Jet Black sillouette of a large  lean human man. When you see these pictures you will get an off/odd feeling. I know they weren  t bears and I know they weren  t humans. I  m not sure what they were  but I know what they were not. After viewing them for about a minute my girlfriend began to get a bit worried they might come down  so we left. And we didn  t talk about it much as she isn  t interested in the subject. However I cannot forget this  or write it off. ,It  s easier to describe on the phone or in person. ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Summer ,6017,yes
646,I was very hesitant to make a report  but was encouraged by a friend.  So here it is. I am an avid equestrian. I am now in my 60â€™s and ride strictly for relaxation. I trail ride 4-5 days a week.  The area I ride is a large rec area called Cronan Ranch.  It is strictly for bikes  horses and hiking with miles and miles of trails.  No motorized vehicles allowed.  The American River borders the rec area. When I ride I almost always go by the river to give my horses a drink.  For hikers/day walkers this particular river access point is the closest to the Pedro Hill trail head parking lot.  But still a long walk to the river with the return being all uphill. In the summer you will almost always find people at this access point enjoying the river.  There has been since I have been riding here over the last 3+ years  a picnic area with several large heavy duty wooden picnic tables. It is a awesome spot with shade and pit toilets nearby the tables.  But it is a tough trek for the average person who might not be fit or small children.  I often ride alone with my dog and lately I bring my other horse along to get exercise.  I pony/lead him while riding my horse.  Because I am older and ride alone so much I try to be very aware of my surroundings for both predatory animals such as bear and lion but also human predators. The latter is not a strong issue here but still wise to be aware. On this particular day I went out later in the morning than I normally do  getting to the trail around noon. There were a few hikers coming back to their cars but very few people and cars around this time of day. I rode about a 6 mile ride and did not see another person the entire ride which is somewhat unusual. I rode to the river to my favorite point for my horses to get a drink where the bank is less rocky.  After the horses watered I decided to go over to the picnic area and take some photos.  I had bought some new camera equipment that I wanted to experiment with and I thought I would use the tables to set up my tripod.  To my surprise the tables had all been removed!  I honestly donâ€™t know if this is significant to the story or not  but it struck me as very strange because it would have been quite a monumental task to remove these very heavy tables. So I stood there just letting the horses rest while a took just a couple of pictures with my phone.  The first pic I will post will be a picture I took looking towards the river.  You will notice the two large trees with the gap looking towards the river.  The river is hard to see as there is a small hill/mound between me and the river.  This photo is strictly for reference. After taking the photo I put my phone away and prepared to head back. I had abandoned the idea of trying the new equipment. As I still stood there facing the river  some movement caught my eye and I turned my eyes toward the movement. What I saw was â€œsomethingâ€ that was obviously darting into some cover to avoid being seen.  I caught only a quick glimpse but the part of the body was the buttocks and leg as it ran and ducked.  It appeared to be reddish brown in color.  As we all know our minds are very capable of quickly assessing what our eyes see - or at least attempting to.  My first impression was oh it is someone down at the river possibly skinny dipping who didnâ€™t know I was there.  The reason I thought it was a person was the movement.  It appeared to be upright and moved and acted like a person wanting not to be seen.  However  I quickly reminded myself it was dark reddish brown  so not likely naked especially with the water in the 40 degree range. Let me say this..I cannot say the reddish brown was hair.  I do not see details like that at that distance to say definitively.  So my next thought was oh it must have been a bear.  Now from the time I saw this and all these thoughts went thru my head was only seconds. Maybe split seconds before what happened next.  Had I only caught this glimpse of whatever it was and that was it? I would have rode on and never thought about it again.  But within a second of jumping into this cover which consisted of some low tree branches and brush   I saw a small group of trees that suddenly began violently shaking.  The branches or trunks were being pushed back and forth crossing over each other by a good four feet and again  violently being shook. I stood there watching in shock and wondering what the hell was that!  I decided to ride up the trail that paralleled this spot and get to a higher point to see if I could figure out what it was.  I kept my eyes peeled for any movement.  The area had bushes and large rocks  but I knew if this was a bear it was open enough that I would eventually catch sight of him.  It is unusual behavior for a bear to climb a tree for safety  and most bears do not wish to share space with humans.  They normally just run or walk away.  They do not normally crouch down and hide.  So my thought was still that this could still be a bear.  After all Bigfoot is not and should not be anyoneâ€™s first thought and it wasnâ€™t mine.  However  when I could not see any sign of anything I was totally mystified and thought that I might backtrack and get closer to the spot and see if anyone or anything was hiding.  Because whatever it was I felt was hiding.  But since I was alone and unarmed I decided to just leave. The more I contemplated what I saw the more mystified I was.  I came home and told my husband the story and he was also shocked and mystified.  So I decided that I would go back the next day and see if I could see any evidence that might explain what I saw. The area as I mentioned before was very rocky and even my horse at over 1000 pounds did not leave much of a track if any.  So I wasnâ€™t really expecting to see a track.  But to my surprise there was a somewhat sandy area near the sighting and I noticed a footprint that had distinct toes.  My first thought was that it was likely a human footprint because this was a popular area and despite the cooler weather and very cold water someone might take off their shoes.  But decided to get down and look closer.  To my shock the footprint was much longer than my boot! While not very wide it was dramatically bigger than mine.  I wear a size 9 (womanâ€™s) and I was also wearing boots which are bigger yet.  I took a photo but unfortunately photos often donâ€™t do justice to the definition that I could see with the naked eye. After finding the footprint I proceeded to the area where the tree(s) was where it darted into.  What shocked me the most was the tree.  What I thought was a group of trees was actually one tree. The diameter of the base was at least a foot or more.  The tree had obviously at some point due to what appears high water levels during a record storm been under water.  The waters had sheared off the top at about the 12 foot level.  After the water receded the tree recovered and grew new branches. It was these branches that were being violently shaken back and forth.  This was not just shaking the tree. The branches were grasped as though with two hands and flailed back and forth.  When it let go of them they snapped back into place. This animal had to reach the 8-10 foot range at least and brutally strong.  While bears are VERY strong and do push on trees  their paws are not very suited to grasp two branches at once and push and pull them apart.  Also why would a bear going from running away to immediately stop and shake the tree.  Iâ€™m not saying that is not possible but doesnâ€™t seem probable.  I did not see any other evidence and due to the fact that I did not see the head of this thing I stay openly skeptical as I think everyone always should.  But that is my story and you can take it for what you wish. ,Cronan Ranch public rec area. American river which was accessed from Pedro Hill staging area ,El Dorado,26,California ,CA,Fall ,6017,yes
647,I was about 100 yards from our camp when I spotted what I thought was a cub bear looking around the camp. This was in broad daylight  around 3 in the afternoon. What really caught my attention was the concentrated interest this cub bear was paying to my backpack in particular. I stood in one place for about 2 minutes watching this sight from 100 yards when this  cub bear  stood up and began to walk away. At 18 years of age I couldn  t force my mind to accept what my eyes were telling me. I watched the baby bigfoot (approx. 4-1/2 ft. tall) walk away from me into the trees for probably a full minute in duration. It disappeared into the trees at a distance of approximately 200-250 yards from me. It  s arms swung like a person and walked with a smooth gate  not at all like a chimp or gorilla. The hair was standing up on the back of my neck and I had a sense that I was witnessing something unnatural. I didn  t tell anyone this incident until recently. ,Approx. 100 yards east of Bullfrog Lake  at 10 500 ft. elevation  while on a backpacking trip in the High Sierras of California.

648,The late Vanwedigen and I were going fishing along the river over the Labor Day weekend.  While back packing in along the forestry trail leading down to the river  we missed a trail marker and wound up at night along the canyon rim.  We made camp on a bluff slightly below the canyon rim.  I didn  t sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning  Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring  about 80 feet from where we  d camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length  with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn  t overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.  Van had grown up in Minnesota hunting and fishing with his dad and brothers.  I decided we should take his advice.  We left and back tracked to Van  s Toyota Landcruiser.  We went over to Bass lake to fish for the rest of the weekend. ,This incident occurred in California  s Sequoia National Forest  the eastern part of Fresno County  along the North Fork of the Kings River  between the Black Rock and Lily Pad camp grounds  below Wishon Reservoir at about 37  north and 119 east.  The actual footprint sighting was on a lower bluff  inside a pool of wet sand about 100   below the canyon rim and about 800 feet above the river. ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Fall ,6019,yes
649,In late August of 1981 I heard a distinct distant wailing animal call similar in character to some of the recordings posted on the BFRO website. I was backpacking with two other people in California  s Sierra Nevada mountains  near the northern boundary of Kings Canyon National Park. About a year later I wrote down a very detailed description of the event. I have always wanted to report this to some appropriate organization  so now that I have found the BFRO site  here it is. I was 16 at the time of the event. I am now 37. The following is a refined version of a description I wrote one year after the event. I was on a backpacking trip with two family friends who were about my parent  s age. Our destination was the Devil  s Punchbowl in California  s Sierra Nevada mountains which is about a 19-mile hike on good trails from the parking lot at Courtright Reservoir. [You can find a topo map of the area at http //www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=11&n=4112372&e=335727&s=50&size=m] The first night we camped at a place called Long Meadow. The second day was a long hike to Fleming Lake (elevation about 9600 feet ) where we made camp just before sunset. Our camp was at the northeast corner of the lake  about 50 yards from the shore  up against a low  steep granite slope. We were the only people camped at that lake that evening. The two adults set about making dinner  and I went fishing at the lake since the fish were jumping vigorously. I started at the point on the lakeshore that was closest to the campsite and worked my way around the north edge of the lake towards the west. It was starting to get dark  the wind was virtually calm  and it was so quiet and peaceful that I could clearly hear occasional sounds from camp about 100 yards away  talking and the clinking of cookware. I was really focused on the fishing since I was very eager to catch something before it got too dark. I was changing a lure when I heard the sound. It was a distant wailing coming from the north/northeast  up a broad open valley  to my left. Fleming Creek runs through this valley. This call is very hard to describe  but one could describe it as human- or primate-like in its smooth  round character. The call was broken up into segments that rose and fell in pitch. Each segment lasted about 1.5 seconds and each followed immediately after the one before it  like  oooOOo  oooOOo  oooOOo  with the pitch and volume rising in the middle of each segment and trailing off abruptly at the end. There were about six segments in the call  making the total call length about 10 seconds. The sound was somewhere between an  oooo  and a  wow  sound. I froze immediately upon hearing this. It did not really scare me  but it commanded all of my attention. I heard it very clearly though it was faint and obviously far away. I would guess its origin could have been anywhere from one to two miles away  up the valley to the north/northeast. As I said it was very calm that evening and sound carries far in conditions like that. The call stopped after the first six  oooOOo  segments  and I immediately and very consciously decided that I was hearing things and ignored it and went back to working on my lure. Then I heard it again and there was no ignoring it. There was a total of five or six very clear  distinct calls made up of about five or six  oooOOo  segments each. The entire event lasted maybe 45 seconds or a minute. Once the second call started I stopped what I was doing and listened very carefully as the call repeated. I was definitely not hearing things. It was not the wind  since the breeze was barely a whisper. I was in an open meadow with a lake immediately in front of me and a tree-covered granite mountain behind me. The sound was not echoing  as there was nothing for it to echo against  and the sound did not trail off as it repeated as an echo does. It started and stopped very deliberately. This spooked me and I packed up all my fishing gear and went back to camp. I told the others that I had heard an animal call of some kind and asked them if they had heard anything but they had not. My guess is that the sound was masked by the noises from their own activities and the steep but low granite slope behind them. I forced myself not to think about it much  since we still had four nights to spend out there and we were headed deeper into the mountains. I did not hear  see  feel  or smell anything unusual for the rest of the trip  though I was pretty keyed up and attentive after that. Regarding the quality of the sound  About a month after I got back from the trip I read in John Green  s book  On the Track of the Sasquatch  the description of the Puyallup recordings from 1973. It describes very well the quality of the call I heard  The unidentified noise is not an  eeeee  scream  but more of a long  whooOooOooOoo  or  whoopwhoopwhoop  at a high pitch and with immense volume. Heard from a distance it can be compared with the sound of a siren far off but it definitely is not that. When I first read that I got chills all over and I felt a little shocked  since that is an extremely good way to describe what I heard. I recently found your website and listened to all the supposed Sasquatch sound recordings  and the sound I heard could easily have been made by the same source. But the sounds on your website are mostly long wails or howls  and what I heard undulated up and down fairly rapidly. The voice itself sounded like a cross between the 1973 Puyallup sounds and the 1993 Del Norte County  angry Bigfoot  scream. But what I heard did not sound in the least threatening. In retrospect  it seemed as if the caller were simply announcing to everyone that it was present. Though there were multiple calls  they all seemed to come from the same source  from the same direction. I did not hear anything that sounded like an answer. To my mind there is no way this could have been a person unless they were playing with an amplifier. The noise was obviously far away and I find it hard to believe anyone (short of an opera singer) could project a call like that over such a distance. There were not that many people out there anyway. Since then I have heard coyotes  owls  horses  donkeys  grouse  and other animals in the wild  and they don  t sound anything at all like what I heard. I have never to my knowledge heard a cougar  so I guess that is a possibility. I have heard that there could have been elk in that area  but I have listened to several elk bugles on the Web  and none of them are remotely like what I heard. Those elk recordings sound like someone trying to make a sound on a saxophone for the first time (dry and squawking)  and what I heard had a very smooth  primate  quality. ,Provided in the main part of my report ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Summer ,6019,no
650,My story of Bigfoot was not visual but rather we heard a scream in the deep forest that we could not explain. The location was in the area of Mono Hot Springs  in the Sierra Nevada  s in California  specifically  the John Muir Wilderness. My brother friend and I were fishing at Doris Lake near dusk.  Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere  we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other  and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him  if I hear that again I am out of here. Well  a minute or so later  the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort  without stopping. I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot  and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.  I did not see anything  so I cant be sure  but I am fairly certian what I heard was not a human  bear or mountian lion.  So....what could it be? Note   my brother and sister worked for several years at Mono Hot Springs.  My sisters good friend who worked their as well had a horse which she kept in the summer time at the springs. While riding in the back country  she claims to have seen Bigfoot walking through a meadow below a bluff she was riding atop. ,Doris Lake is located about 1.5 miles from the Mono Hot Springs Resort ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Summer ,6019,no
651,My story occured around 1991 on the San Joaquin River in what would be the northwestern part of town. Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self  my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn  t to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it  thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do  this creature basically turned it  s whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us  this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn  t more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs. ,On the San Joaquin River ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Summer ,6019,yes
652,In the distance a loud  howl  like sound was heard. At first we thought maybe a bear had been hit by a car. Each  howl  lasted approx. 15 seconds. After the 3rd or 4th time another sound began echoing around the walls of the valley we were in. The closest thing I can  think of is someone speaking backward English through a megaphone. This lasted for around 5 minutes. The entire time none of us could make out a single word. Yet it sounded English. We basically figured that it was a crew of people looking for the animal making the first howl. Even though it was obvious that the original sound came from miles away. The first  howl  sounded very similar to a recording I heard on a page linked to BFRO  s homepage. ,Huntington Lake  California ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Winter ,6019,no
653,Several friends and I were riding our mtbs on the swamp route. There was about a 3-5 minute gap between each of us.  As i ascended the trail I heard a large animal moving in the forest about 20 yards off the trail. I couldn  t see it but could clearly hear it in the underbrush.  As i proceeded up the trail one of my friends was in the trail looking at something.  A set of very large footprints were in the trail.  This was about 200 yards up from were i heard the noises.  The track came from off the trail onto it and proceeded down the trail about 30-50.  The subject walked a few steps the stopped and stood still moved a few more feet stopped as if listening.  It proceedded down the trail a few more yards before heading into a small meadow.  This meadow is very near the place i head the noises in the bush.  The foot prints were in very deep silty powder and were very well detailed.  I could see the lines in the sole of the foot the toes were very splayed and there was little to no arch.  total lenght of the prints was about 14-15  as I could fit my whole foot shoe and all in the print.  The track was liad down on top of the tracks of my friends who were about 5 min. ahead of us.  A couple of bear hunters came upon us and we asked them what they thought  and they had never seen such a track. After loosing the track off of the road we proceeded with our ride.  About one half mile up the road the track apeared again fromm off the road moving across the road going downhill toward the previous site of prints.  The bear hunters also found the new tracks and tired to follow it but the brush was too thick. ,65 miles east of Fresno California  on the Swamp Lake 4WD route.

654,gentlemen  here is my account of what i remember. fresno  ca. 1995. mono creek camp ground. about 12 or 14 miles above lake huntington. in the sierras. myself  my fishing pardner  and another gentleman  were all fishing a small part of the river there  it was the last weekend of the season  before they close the roads  due to snow. about 3 miles down the river  my pardner decided he had enough  and stop to nap. this other gentleman and myself pushed on  maybe 3/4 of mile from where we had left my friend. i stop to fish a pool. the other guy  dropped down to the next pool  to fish it  that is how we were working the differant areas. 1 guy would stop to fish a hole and the other would go right down below. as i was fishing my little stretch  i noticed the guy coming back up  he looked very excited and was waving for me to come there  i figured that he landed a good fish  or had seen a bear. he was almost in a frenzy  he just told me to hurry when i caught up to him he was looking over the edge of the next little drop off  i looked over and saw nothing unusual  he said it was right there  and jumped his way down to the spot  i followed  asking him what he had seen. before i could even get the words out of my mouth this smell  i cant explain to you what it was  wet  moldy  well animal  musk filled the air  nothing i have smelled ever was like this. my friend then told me that he had seen it  again before i could even ask above us i saw it  there standing no more then i would say 25 yards up the hill  was a the creature i believe to be a bigfoot. about 8 foot tall  covered in a reddish brown  and some what black hair  the face i remember it looking almost humanoid in appearance. it then turned and began taking huge strides up the mountain  not running  but covering some serious ground.on 2 feet. not 4. i tried to follow it  but again i felt an almost hynotic sensation over take me  and my pardner later told me he felt the same way  and  i couldnt move  we watched it go right up to the top and over it. i felt very over whelmed  and did not say anything to my friend  we just walk in a silence back to our other friend  he could tell we were shooken up. but never let him in on what had just occured. to this day  when ever i think about it  i get overwelmed with emotion. when i got home i called the gentleman and talked to him about what we had seen  the feelings we went through were basically the same  when he saw the creature he said he could smell the smell i described  but not nearly as bad as when we came down to where it had been standing. then a strange feeling over took him as well  almost like we were hypnotized  or drugged. he has trouble now remembering what he looked liked  he can remember seeing it and the smell  but all other memeories are fading. i can tell you   i will never forget what he looked like  and have came to my own conclusions  i believe the smell the bigfoot emits can be used as sort of a defense system  let me explain  i believe when excited or scared the aroma he emits can actually work on a persons system  maybe for one  it makes you feel drugged  or for another it makes you feel hypnotized or just plain scared. the reason i feel this way  is like i said to this day  when i think about it  i am over come with emotion.  i hope this might help in some small way  thank you for your time. ,above Huntington Lake  in the sierras  Mono Creek Campground. ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Fall ,6019,no
655,I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I  d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light  snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long  shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened  we both simultaneously looked at each other said  what the hell was that?  and then said  we better not tell anyone or they  ll think were crazy!   I can  t swear to what it was  but I  ll swear it wasn  t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long  very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human  not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all. ,Occurred on Forest Road 80  on the road to Lake Florence  about 10 miles north of Huntington Lake. ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Winter ,6019,yes
656,My friend Greg and I had been fishing the San Juaquin river just below Florence Lake until about 6 30 or 7 00 pm.

It takes almost 2 hours to travel the 20 miles back to state highway 168 at Huntington Lake.  So it is about a three and a half hour trip home.  A trip that niether of us wanted to drive after a long day fishing  especially at night.  As the area we were fishing in is notoriously bad for bears  we decided to drive to a camp spot that we were both familiar with just back up the way From Florence Lake.  The camp spot is not in a campground  and is just a single spot off to the side of the road.  But it is a well used spot by many people.  We set up camp  had dinner  and had just sat down next to the campfire.  The light of day was almost totally gone.  We were sitting across from one another as we had both been taught to do when in the wilderness  so you can see if any animals are coming up from behind the other person. Gregs back was to the car and the road.  My back was to a low rising granite out cropping  almost a dome like shaped out cropping that is flat on top.  about 50 yards beyond that is a rather steep dirt ledge that goes up maybe another 25 feet above where we were sitting.  I heard a noise that sounded like a horn on a train passing somewhere in the distance.  I even said to Greg  do you here that train in the distance.  he said yes   he heard it.  We continued to hear it for a while  when suddenly it dawned on both of us that we were at 9000 feet in elevation  and there are no trains for about 70 miles.  Now we were curious about the sound.  And that is how I would best describe it  as the horn on a train in the distance.  It was not an owl  I have heard many owls.  As we continued to listen  it became closer  and became clear that it was over or on the ledge behind me.  I moved to the car  and grabbed a 12 guage shotgun.  The last time we heard it  it was extremely close to us  but still had that low mono toned almost horn like sound.  Not knowing what we were dealing with  and not wanting to shoot someone or something  we called out a warning that we had a gun  just incase it was someone playing a prank.  We did not hear the sound again.  However  as we were both looking out toward the granite out cropping  and the ledge where the sound was coming from  we both turned and looked at each other at the very same time to ask if the other had just seen the same thing.  We had  a pair of eyes glowing in the distance.  Almost like cat eyes  but not yellow like cat eyes  they were more silver  or white.  We only saw them for a second.  Still not wanting to shoot at what I couldn  t see  I fired a warning shot in the air.  I didn  t here or see anything after that  however  Greg insists he saw the eyes again  even after I fired the shot. Not wanting to find out what isn  t afraid of a twelve guage  Greg  threw all of our camping gear in the car as fast as he could while I stood guard with the gun.   We dumped our entire jug of water on the fire  got in the car and drove all the way home.  Niether of us said a word until we got back to town.  I have been all over the mountains up in that area  and have been camping and four wheeling into the back country since I was a kid.  That part of the Sierras is like my backyard to me  and I had never experienced anything like that.  Bears  mountain lions  the rare badger sighting  but nothing like that. ,Kaiser Pass Road forks just above Mono Hot Springs.  One side heads toward Edison Lake the other towards Florence lake.  We were camping right along the road to Florence on a ridge just before the road drops down toward the lake.  Maybe 2 - 3 miles from the lake itself. ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Summer ,6019,yes
657,My 15 year old cousin and I were walking in a medow below the ranch cook house. It was late october and the other ranch hands had left for the season  leaving my cousin and I to close up the ranch for the winter  there where no other people around the area. The summer backpackers had all gone. It was around dusk when we heard a noise  it started out as a low rumble  we almost felt it before we heard it.  But it then rose in volume and pich. it was like a babbling scream. It could almost sound like words  the screem lasted at least 30 seconds or more then rose to a shreak and ended abruptly.  It sounded as though it came from a point 50 or so yards from where we were standing  a thick grove of trees and deadfalls we call the island.  I could hear something moving in the trees and starting to circle the meadow we were in. IT screamed again and sounded as though it had moved to our right.  My cousin and I were shaken by the noise and we ran for the cook house. Sitting inside we heard it again and it sounded as  though it was now in the medow below us  but the darkness made it imposible to see anything. At this time we moved from the cooks cabin to a building we call the winter room.  We locked the door and spent the night there ( the room is bear proof and therefore safe). We heard it maybe five more times  around the ranch and once I was woken up at maybe three in the morning  by something outside our room. The next day I searched for tracks but the ground was frozen though it hadn  t snowed yet. We found no tracks  but there was a hand print on the door of a store room where we keep food from bears during the summer.  The print of the palm was nearly as big as both my palms put together  and the fingers where as big as three of mine in length (this thing had long fingers).  The print was upside down near the bottom of the door as though it was trying to pry the door open from the bottom. (the print was still partily there next summer  At the time it seemed oily).  I am twenty three. I have been backpacking and camping since I was five.  I have grown up in the mountins and on the Ranch  I have heard mountin lions on more than one occassion  I have also heard a wounded bear screem (someone had shot it). The noise that my cousin and I heard was unlike any thing I have heard Ever. We call it the Yargle thing  and joke about it after the fact  but at the time it really scared us. (I don  t scare easily we mountain men are from tough stock). I have heard and seen nothing since. This happend winter of 99. ,The area is located above Huntington Lake  further location details withheld at request of witness. ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Fall ,6019,yes
658,There were three of us hiking through the rock creek area of the Ansel Adams Wilderness.  Michael discovered the tracks and brought them to our attention.  The tracks were heading in a northern direction across this large meadow.  The tracks were eighteen and one half inches long and had a width of eight inches.  Some of the tracks were up to three inches deep.  The stride varied from four feet to six feet in length.  There were over twelve tracks that were idenafiable.  Then to our surprise we found a broken branch next to one of the footprints that had three hair samples clinging to the bark.  We have no results from the hair samples because we lost two of the hairs and we only have one in our posession at this time. ,Area is remote and very few hikers travel through this area. ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Fall ,6019,no
659,I was hunting at sample meadow above Huntington lake  I had just walked through a marshy area and had gotten into some dense pine trees when I spooked two deer up and I got a glimpse of them as they ran through the trees. I stopped and was motionless for a couple of minutes when I heard a loud expulsion of air and a branch snapped behind me in the thick pine trees I had never heard anything like that before so I froze and did not move  and about one minute later I heard the same sound from a little farther away and then the next time I heard it  it was closer and to the north  this happened about six times each time it was in a different location like it was trying to see what I was and scare me off. The last time I heard it sounded like it was right behind me and I flinched then it must have seen me I heard it running away from me through the trees making the same noise and breaking limbs as it was running off. I stood in the same spot for about five minutes and did not hear it again. I walked out of the woods to my truck where my dad was waiting for me and we drove about a mile down the road to a campsite to eat lunch. At lunch I told my dad what happened and described the noise and he thought it might have been a buck grunting it sounded good to me since I never heard a buck grunt. So we decided that the buck might come back to that spot. So we ate lunch and drove back to the same spot. We hiked in and at the marshy part I told him to go in the direction that the deer ran to and I would try to spook them out again I waited for him to get out of site then I walked toward the pine trees  I got to the pines trees when I seen three does running in my direction toward the grove of trees in front of me  just before they got to the trees I heard the same noise again the expulsion of air and a branch break it spooked the deer two of them ran downhill and the last one ran uphill right at me it stopped within ten feet of me but it never seen me it was so frazzled by what it saw it stopped slowly turned around and tried to see around the tree to what had spooked it. It stood there for about one minute oblivious to me it then slowly turned around and started walking right at me it got within five feet of me then I flinched my arm so it would see me before it walked into me  it startled it so bad the deer fell down on its side did a spin on the ground and jumped up and ran the other way when it got around the tree and down about twenty yards I heard that noise again. The deer ran down and to the south and I seen it stop about 150 yards away through a clearing it would look at me then it would look at where the noise came from  it looked back and forth several times then it slowly walked away. I then followed where the deer had ran to see what was making that noise I walked very slowly came around the tree and about thirty yards down the tree line I saw a large figure with black hair sitting under a large pine tree sunning  it had large shoulders four to six inch hair but you could still see the muscular definition of its chest and shoulders there was a fallen tree blocking my view below its waistline. But we locked eyes and stared at each other motionless  it had dark eyes I could not see any white  I could see the hair on its head blowing slightly in the breeze  I didnâ€™t see any facial hair just a very dark skin face like an ape  after looking at each other for about a minute I wanted to get closer but the fallen tree was in my way so I took a step to my left to go around and when I got out of its site I heard it get up and bound through the trees making the same noise as it ran away from me the loud expulsion of air and breaking branches as it ran off. ,Near Keiser pass east side of sample meadow ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Fall ,6019,yes
660,Camped at Jackass Meadow just below Florence Lake.  I was tired from a long day of fishing and driving to Lake Edison  so I ate and fished a little more and retired for the evening.  It was a full moon out and everything was really calm for a campground.  I went to bed in my tent fairly early and woke up several times during the evening.  Every thing was quiet and I got up to store my food in the bearboxes around camp.  I didn  t hear anything or see any thing when I was awake.  I went back to bed and nodded off.  I awoke again from my sleep to a noise that I had never heard in the mountains.  It was late  and everyone to my knowledge was asleep.  The noise was coming from the east of the campground i  d say approx. 1/2 a mile to a mile.  I would say that it sounded the same as someone blowing through a conch shell mixed with and large mammal of some sorts.  I heard the noise two times after I awoke in five second intervals  right after one another  and then silence.  It was fairly loud and I knew that it was off in the distance because there was no other noise in the woods.  I have been camping/hiking/and mountaineering all over the West Coast and I have never heard anything like that sound. ,Jackass Meadow campground  on the outskirts of camp. ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Summer ,6019,no
661,I would like to start with my background as a backpacker and hunter.  I go to the Sierra Nevada Mountains about 1 and a half hours outside of Fresno  California.  Last summer around the time of the sighting  I made about 11 trips to numerous places. This is what I do.  I feel I have a good knowledge of the outdoors  and I have becomes quite at home in the wilderness. On Friday  July 14  2006 my friends  Jason and one other person who has asked me to exclude his name from this report  started out on a backpacking trip to Hobler Lake in the John Muir Wilderness. We started off our hike a little late in the day  about 5 00 pm  on the Maxsom trailhead  just on the east side of Courtright Reservoir. We were hiking for about an hour  this being about 6 00 pm in the day.  It was dusk when we noticed something moving parallel to us in the woods.  It was hard to make out what it was because of the terrain consisting of dense wooded areas with evergreen trees.  It had a reddish brown color  and in the distance you could tell it was much bigger than a person was.  We assumed it was a black bear so we moved on. Whatever it was seemed quite interested in us.  Every time we stopped  it would stop moving as well.  This continued for about an hour until it got too dark to see clearly without a flashlight. We continued hiking to our destination for a while when I started hearing a crackling of branches to my left about 50 feet behind me  maybe less.  When I turned around  I saw a black outline of something looking at me from behind a tree.  I froze for a second because I was in such shock over what I was seeing.  Out of all the animals Iâ€™ve seen at night in the mountains  this had no resemblance.  It was standing on two legs  was about 7 and one half feet tall  and was 4 feet wide at the shoulders.  It had hardly no neck  and very long arms that hung down by its mid legs.  It also had a fluffy appearance like it had a thick long coat of fur. Then I whispered to my friend Jason to shine a flashlight on it.  As I said that  this thing must have heard me  because it turned around and started walking off somewhat fast.  At this time we decided to load our firearms  which werenâ€™t much because all we had was a 40 caliber pistol and a 22 pistol.  For a time  whatever it was seemed to have left the area. We arrived at Hobler Lake around 10 00 pm.  We set up our camp  cooked some food  and rested for a bit.  I finally fell asleep about 11 30 pm  but Jason and my other friend stayed up. When I awoke in the morning  Jason told me that he and bob were by the lake having a cigarette when they heard large objects crashing in the water about 100 yards from them.  He described it a like something very large was jumping and thrashing in the water. The next day we were staying close to camp because of all that went on.  We walked about away from camp to explore the area when we heard noise from camp like the clinking of pots and stuff.  We ran back to camp to find nothing out of place  but when looked closer some things were slightly moved  but not very far away from where we left them. ,You take Highway 168 east out of Fresno to Shaver Lake.  In Shaver Lake  make a right on Dinkey Creek Road and follow the signs to the Courtright Reservoir.  Go across the dam to the camping area.  Thatâ€™s where the 4x4 trail begins.  Take the 4x4 trail for like half a mile until you reach the trailhead on the right.  That will lead you to Hobler Lake. ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Summer ,6019,yes
662,It was late October 2006. My hunting partner and I were deer hunting near Heart Lake  which is located off the John Muir Trail behind Florence Lake.  We  d been back there for almost a week looking for the elusive Big Daddy Buck that we  ve hunted religiously for the last three years. We were high up on this ridge just before nightfall.  We were hiking back to our base camp and heard a loud bellowing howl that sent a shiver down our spines.  We looked at each other with confused looks on our faces  not knowing what that sound was.  We decided to hurry back to camp  but we heard another howl  but closer this time.  We saw Big Daddy Buck running down the opposite ridge side  and busting through brush  not caring if hunters spotted him.  Then again  we heard that bellowing howl  and saw on top of the ridge a dark silhouette that looked like a bear standing on its hind feet.  I brought my rifle scope to my eye to take aim on this so-called bear.  As I looked through the scope  I realized it was no bear.  I thought it could have been a really tall man in some kind of camouflage suit  but it looked like no man that I have ever seen.  It ran down the hill and disappeared into the brush  like it was chasing the deer.  So we decided to go and track down this creature.  Once we arrived at where it was standing  there was a footprint in the dirt that made my footprint look like a child  s footprint.  It was four times the size of mine. We never saw the creature again and never heard that howl  but then again  I  ve never gone back since then. , ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Fall ,6019,no
663,My wife and I were driving at about 9 30 p.m. Between Grant Grove and Cherry Gap on highway 180  when we came around a corner and our headlights lit up the straight away and next corner about 100 yards away and at the next corner we saw a large hairy figure walking upright as it stepped onto the road at an angle towards us and it took large strides and crossed the road and went down the embankment. It was very tall with dark hair. I have other observations about the sighting but I was afraid I couldn  t get it all done in the aloted time. , ,Fresno,17,California ,CA,Summer ,6019,yes
664,I was about 10 or 11 years old.  My brother 15 month  s older and a friend my age.  I am now 53 years old.  We lived in the country outside of Eureka California.  We went fishing at the end of our rural Rd  Ole Hanson Rd.  As kids would do we wandered off in the woods and found an old logging road that we decided to walk up.  About 15 minutes up the road we heard a noise in the woods on the other side of the road  we huddled together and waited to see who was there. We saw a creature on the other side  in the trees.  We began to run back down the road and the creature kept pace with us although we knew due to the size it could easely go faster. it stayed in the brush and trees and when it would get ahead of us  it would stop and watch us but never came across the road just followed and watched from across the road. When we reached the center of clearing on Hanson  s property we stopped and looked back.  It was no longer there.  About two years ago I asked my brother if he remembered the incident  thinking it was something I had just imagened  and he said  just as wided eyed as that day  yes it was real. I watched your program on bigfoot tonight and that day became so real again because the film you showed was our boogieman. As I think back on it now I feel it was very curious of us although we were very scared at the time ,The end of Ole Hanson rd.

665,This incident happened 41 years ago when I was 19 years old. My friend and I were bear hunting up in Humboldt County on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. It was in March or April. Back then bear hunting was open all year long in Humboldt County  and there were no limits. We were from Southern California  and were totally unfamiliar with the area. We stopped in a town on the Trinity river  I believe the name of the town may have been Willow Creek  I  m not sure. Anyway we met some Indians in town  and asked them  if they knew of any good places to hunt bear. They said they didn  t  but added  that there was an old man in the grocery store who may be able to help us. The Indians pointed to an old blue 1950 Buick parked in front of the store  and told us that the car belonged to the old man  so we waited there until he came out. When he came back to his car  we introduced ourselves  and asked him if he knew of any good places to hunt bear. He told us it was pretty good up on the Hoopa Reservation  and gave us some general directions. We ended up on an old deserted dirt road high in the mountains in my friends dads 1949 (4) door Chevy. We kept going up until we hit snow  started to fishtail  and the right rear wheel went over the side. We set the hand brake and got out of the car to evaluate the situation. We decided to get the bumper jack out of the trunk  and jack the car up  and then push it off of the jack back on the road. The plan worked and all 4 wheels were back on the road. We backed down the road until we came to a place where we could turn around. By now it was dusk  and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark. At the turn around spot next to the road we saw a big pine tree and decided to set up camp under the tree. By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark. We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down  and were talking for about ten minutes  when we heard the first grunt outside the tent. We both pretended that we didn  t hear anything and kept talking. Then it did it again  and this time we both stopped  and I asked my friend if he heard that. He said he did  and also heard it the first time. I said yeah  me too. Now  we both shut up and listened. We could hear it circling the tent  because the ground was covered with bark  and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet. We could also hear its very loud breathing. By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing  we figured whatever this was  it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet. It circled the tent several times  and we decided that one of us should go out and see what it was. Niether of us wanted to go out  because we were scared  so we decided to flip a coin to see which one of us would go. My friend lost. I then suggested that before he went out  it may be wise  to fire the 44 mag out of the tent flap first. He concurred  and stuck the barrel out of the flap and fired 5 shots. We then both went out  he had the 44  and I held the light. We looked all over and didn  t see a thing. We went back in the tent  laid down  and were  trying to figure out what had just been outside of the tent. We had never heard of sasquatch. We had been talking for about 5 or 10 minutes when we heard a very loud high pitched scream  that lasted for about 5 seconds  and sounded like it was about 50 to 100 yards away. We looked at each other and asked  what the heck was that? That was one heck of a scream. We talked a little longer and then went to sleep. The rest of the night was un-eventful. We arose the next morning and went outside  and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints. We couldn  t see any  because the ground was covered  with many years accumulation of bark from the huge pine tree we were camped under. We had wondered many times  what it was  that had been outside our tent that night and often talked about it. Then one day several years later  I happened to be in the barber shop  getting a haircut. I picked up an Argosy magazine  and it had the now famous controversial picture of the female sasquatch on the cover. I read the article  and in the article there was a map with an X on it. The X indicated where the picture was supposedly taken. The X on the map wasn  t far from where we were camped that night. That  s when I made the connection and since then after reading about many encounters I am pretty well convinced that the animal that we had heard outside of our tent 41 years ago was a sasquatch. ,I don  t specifically recollect  it has been 41 years ago and I didn  t know the area to begin with. However I may be able to point it out in a general way on a map. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Spring ,6023,no
666,This was a long time ago where I grew up in northern California.  I lived in a small town called Piercy  California about 17 miles from Garberville.  This encounter was located in a small mill town called Myers Flat.  Two friends and I were hunting up an old logging road roughly 2 miles up the mountain across the Eel River from the town.  I was far ahead of my friends and decided to scare them as they came up the trail so I climbed up some rock cliffs for a better advantage and settled down within some Huckleberry bushes to wait for my friends.  After things quieted down I noticed a heavy smell and started looking around.  The breeze was blowing straight from the brush behind me and I felt the hair on my neck starting to rise up. My two friend were nowhere in sight.  I noticed a small movement in the berry bushes right behind me.  I stood up ready to run when this thing stood up also.  It didn  t hesitate but turned and walked off into the brush.  I heard trees snapping and the crunch of dry leaves echo away as I ran back to my friends who were still two hundred yards away.  After I calmed down we went back to the spot to look for some sign.  They believed I saw a bear but I know what I saw.  We found where something was squatted down and stripping berries.  I had disturbed its meal.  Small trees were just broken off about 4 feet from the ground as the thing made its retreat. ,Take the Myers Flat loop road to the river.  There was an old logging bridge about half way around. The sighting was up that road about two miles. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,yes
667,I grew up on the mountain along the Eel river (Kings Range) I can not tell you the exact year that I had this sighting not sure if I was 11 or 12. That would of put it at 62 thru 64. I was below our house and used to go down to the spring and just hang out out. I got halfway down and looked across and there was this big ape in my mind looking at me. It is still so clear that moment. I do know that I left first and I never said a word to anyone what I saw. Our house burned down in 67 or 68 and we moved to Eureka. When my sister and I became adults I told her what I saw that day and she started crying she had experined the same thing only she was down at the spring and he was above her on the log. I moved back to the home place the spring of 1972 and everything was fine. I lived there with my son and at that time whoever needed a place. That Fall everyone pretty much left and as the nightly custom I would build a fire and my son and I would sit around it and eat. We had no electricity or anything. That hillside always rang with birdsong  never a quiet moment. That night there was silence and a wierd feeling came over me like eyes were watching . I grabbed my son and a few clothes and we hiked down to the nearest house. I never went back there to live it scared me that bad. There is alot more stories I could tell you about this mountain but I will leave that for later. I know what I saw that day and I know the feelings that I had years later. I would like to say that this was 40 acres that I grew up on and always felt safe after that night I left I never got that feeling back again something changed. The birds never sang like before either.  I would like to say I sent this account to Bobbie Short 2 years ago but asked not to have it published . The only reason I  m writting it now is because of the 2 other accounts that I read. ,First Salmon Creek turnoff coming from Myers Flat. Go down Salmon Creek Rd. First dirt rd. going up the hill to the right is where I grew up . Stay on the county rd. and you will come to a real tight curve. at that curve there is a spring coming off the hill. If you hiked up that hill not far you would come to a burnt out Redwood laying across bank to bank. Looking up the hill to your left there would be a big stump and at one time my brothers playhouse. That is where I had my sighting. I never knew until my sister and I were both adults that she had aa sighting in the exact location only he was standing on the log. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Unknown ,6023,yes
668,Me and four other boys had found an old logging cabin about three miles up in the woods from Myers Flats and used this old shelter for several summers.  One night (the last one) we were all camping for the weekend in this old place that we had fixed up.  After cooking the evening meal  we had all eaten and went to bed.  Sometime during the night I was awakened by a huffing sound.  I woke one of the other boys up and we listened to something slowly working its way all around the outside of the cabin.  We woke up the three others and all listened.  Whatever it was outside was poking at the old rotted boards around the bottom of the shack.  We could hear it shuffle around and pry at some of the boards.  Finally it moved around to the front door  which was only about five feet high and Butch got my old .22 rifle and said   Open the door!   I did not want to open the door but did anyway.  Whatever it was  was standing right in front of the opening but because it was dark  all we could see were hairy legs.  Butch fired the .22 and this thing screamed and spun around and took off.  Needless to say we were scared to death.  We heard two or three heavy thuds and then everything was quiet.  We tried to sleep but ended up huddled up together in the middle of the floor the rest of the night.  The next morning we went out as a group and searched the ground.  There was a tore up place where this thing spun around and about three or four indentations in the ground where it took off.  There was no blood on the ground anywhere.  We packed up and never went back. ,About three miles west of Myers Flats up in the woods on an old logging road. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,yes
669,I grew up in the woods of the Pacific Northwest.  My father also grew up there. He was born in Klamath Falls  Oregon  but grew up in the eastern SF Bay Area.  He has a BS in Forestry  A Masters in Zoology  and A PHD in Entomology  and worked as a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service.  For most of his 20-30 years of service  my father did research on insects that predate timber harvest species in California and Oregon.  When he did his research (usually in the summer and fall) my younger brother and I would accompany him into the woods.  My father was and is a great woodsman  a hunter and fisherman  who taught my brother and myself all about the forests and what types of plants and animals lived there.  My father was also a man of science and this is important to note as will become evident later. At the end of each summer season  my family and some other forestry families would get together and take several weeks of vacation.  Most often  we would load canoes and float down the lower 15-30 miles of the Klamath River to its mouth.  My father and I would fly fish for steelhead in the riffles during mornings and evenings and we would spend the hot hours of the day canoeing  exploring  resting  etc. These trips would often take one to two weeks to complete.  During one of these trips (probably in 1969 or 1970  I was about 8-9 years old I think...) we made camp on the river bar at the mouth of Tek-Tah creek.  There was a good flat bar there  and at that time of year  the creek was flowing under the sand and apeared dry. One afternoon  while everyone else was napping  my father and I took a walk up the creek bed to see if the creek was flowing on the surface somewhere inland.  About two hundred yards upsteream  the creek did come to the surface and flowed sluggishly thruogh a series of large pools. I remember my dad telling me that these pools were probably full of baby salmon and steelhead waitng for fall rains to allow them to swim down to the main river and out to sea.  My dad had a very scientific mind and he would describe natural processes in great detail when we had the patience to listen. As we proceeded inland up the creek  we rounded a bend and entered a long  sandy bar on the east side of a long arching pool in the creek. As I looked across the surface of this bar  I saw a set of tracks in the soft sand. These tracks caught my attention because they were very large  and the space between them seemed very long  like if I laid down next to them  they would almost be further apart than the legth of my body.  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad  who is pretty big (6   2 ). The tracks began at the water  s edge at the lower end of the bar  and proceeded diagonally across the bar in a straight line to the far end of the bar. My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was  unknown  until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge  I had not heard of any such animal at that time  nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then  but these tracks...thier size  gait  and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me.  My father was also very interested in the tracks  he asked me please not to walk near or in them  then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them  and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them.  He seemed very tense  as if he sensed something  or was trying to figure something out.  Eventually  I got bored of sitting and got up and followed him. When I finally caught up with him  we were half-way up the bar.  He had stopped looking at the tracks and was instead looking intently at the timber ahead and at the southern edge of the bar.  He was very quiet and tense.  I have never seen my father frightened or worried about anything before  or since for that matter  but watching him the way he scanned the surrounding forest so intently  made me very nervous and excited.  I broke the silence and began to ask him what he thought made the tracks and what was he trying to see in the trees...He turned around  almost jumping a little in suprise  and told me to be quiet.  then he looked around some more  and started back towards the camp with a qick pace  grabbing me by the hand  and saying these are the tracks of a big bear  son  and we should leave this area alone from now on.  Then he told me not to come up the creek alone  and not to tell Mama or my brother or any of the others anything about what we saw  that it might worry them or something  and that he would speak no more of this matter.  Just like that! Well the older I get the funnier that incident and those tracks seem to me. I have hunted for many years and have seen and tracked many animals in the woods since that time  and have never seen anything like that since.  I am thirty eight now  and my father has retired. I asked my father about this incident last year  and he was silent and pensive for a long time  then he told me that he does  nt remember this time or seeing anything other than bear tracks. I don  t know what we really saw that day  but I do know that it scared my dad  and he has never ever spoken to me the way he did on that day  or behaved that way since. ,To get to this place  you must float down the Klamath river from Johnson  s Bar (I think that is the name of the place  it is or was as far down river as you could drive on the Karok indian reservation road from the confluence of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers)approx. 1-2 miles to the mouth of Tek-Tah Creek on the southern side of the river. Then you must walk up the bar of Tek-Tah Creek about 1/2 miles or so to a place where the creek canyon curves to the east and the creek itself flowed against a steep curved cliff or hillside. The cliff was about 150 yards long and perhaps 50-100   high. the creek flowed against this cliff and formed a deep (maybe 6-7  ) arched pool about 100 yards or so long.  On the eastern side of the creek was a large bar made of fine dry sand and some gravel.  This bar was as long as the pool  and was maybe 50yards wide at its largest spot. The creek was flanked on bothe sides by steep and desnse timber and brush.  There may have been some debrees on the bar  but I can  t remember (It is strange what you can and cannot remember after so many years...).  At the northern end of this bar is where I saw the tracks. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Fall ,6023,yes
670,A friend and I were on our way to mouth of Klamath River area to fish on friends boat and pulled off hiway at  Stony Lagoon  approx 3-4 mi So. of Orick  Ca. We went west over a small hill and down to a camping area almost on the beach passing through 200  -300   of brush and trees. We parked our m/cycles 10 or so feet apart and built a sml fire and unrolled our sleeping bags There was a very bright moon out over the ocean west of the beach.About 100  west of us & 30  or so ft from the water a large humanlike form was trotting or bouble timing So.down the beach.My buddy yelled at him/it to come join us .He kept on going.We took our flashlite and went down to the beach.Don  t know what made the prints but theylooked to be at least 6  wide and at least 12 if not 14  long.Maybe longer.We went back to the fire and my friend heard noises in the brush behind us.He shined the lite in the brush and said he saw eyes.We rolled our bags and lost no time leaving.The prints in the sand were a good 10   apart ,Stony Lagoon  South of Orick Ca is 1/4 mi west of coast hiway and is a well known camp ground.(now!) ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,no
671,There was about 10 of us watching the Perseids meteor shower from a clearing near an area where we were building a small cabin. Previously that summer we had heard some moanings or low growlings up on the top edge of the property coming from the uncut Bureau of Land Management forest  but did not think much of it. Everybody else got tired of watching the meteor shower (it was spectacular!!!) and went back to the cabin site. I was alone laying on my back in a clearing about 100 yards from camp at about midnight  looking up at the stars and admiring the shower when I had the feeling of another presence. This seems to be a common phrase in these situations but I have to say that this feeling of being watched is something I never felt before or after. Makes you wonder about some sort of a higher lever of consciousness or something similiar (dare I say telepathic?). I got up and cut over to a logging road that went back to camp and was about 20 yards from camp when I heard a rustling off to my right just a few feet away in dense brush. I did not even look to see what it was. I just sprinted the rest of the way back to camp and did not say anything. We were having a good time listening to loud rock and roll music (car stereo with trunk open) and drinking beer when a friend of mine said to me   Do you smell that ... what is it??  Well ... I had been noticing this odor but had not said anything. It smelled like a cross between an oil refinery (very sulfurish) and had an animal musk smell to it and was VERY VERY strong. I recognized the animal muskiness from my trapping days as a youth  so I told my friend   This is an animal.  My friend said it smelled like diesel fuel and put out his cigarette it smelled so strong. This smell was so strong that it seemed that it had to be right in front of your face. We figured it was coming from a particular stand of trees and decided to walk up and behind this stand to see if we could still smell it. When we got behind the stand we couldn  t smell it but when we got back around down-wind of the stand we heard something take off downhill and down-wind of us. All we saw was swaying brush where it had gone crashing down the mountain side. Some of the guys wanted to chase it but I convinced them that since it had left that we should leave it alone if it left us alone. Well ... in 15 minutes the smell was back. This time everybody in camp grabbed a gun ... we had a lot of guns and decided to chase this smelly thing down. Except for me and 2 others. I just had a flashlight. Well ... they chased this thing out of the aforementioned stand of trees and could hear it and smell it but could not see it. We could hear it stomping and thrashing around behind the stand of trees. They chased it up a narrow trail that led to a spring. I was bringing up the rear but only had the flashlight so I went back to camp with the other 2 that had remained. We could hear the  hunting party  about 50 or 60 yards up this narrow difficult trail yelling  He  s right up here ... there he is!!!!  Then the yelling stopped for a few seconds then they started screaming. They came running out of the forest single file screaming in fear. They said the could hear and smell what they were chasing but could not see it and then suddenly there was no sound or smell. At this point they decided that whatever it was had stepped off of the trail and they had run right by it. Well this freaked them out and explains their hasty retreat. It was quiet the rest of the night but a couple of mornings later 2 of the guys were sleeping in a 2-man tent on a hillside above the camp and woke the rest of us at first light  yelling. When we got to the tent we found a huge turd about 18 inches from the front of the tent opening. It was about 4-inches in diameter and about 20 inches long and appeared to be mostly leafy material with some berry seeds. I guess that was his notice to us that he did not appreciate our company!!! It was uneventful for the rest of the summer. ,This happened North of the Hoopa Indian reservation in Humboldt county California  North of Witchepec on the Northern side of the Klamath River about 2 miles up the side of the mountain. This was the last privately owned 40 acres before Bureau of Land Management land. Very rugged terrain.

672,A friend and I went driving to camp in Oregon on Hwy. 199 in the Fall of 1985. We didn  t want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two Malamute-cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many back-country adventures. As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep. Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from  childlike  to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I  ve had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation. We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning. The second  experience  I had at Avenue of the Giants was with the same friend while we were hiking a trail there. It was again the Fall of 1985 about a month later than the first. We had a map with us and decided to cut a loop short by going cross-country through the dense redwood forest. Not long after we got started  the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline. We reached the top and noticed large foot-shaped impressions (maybe 14-18 inches long and 8-10 inches wide) in the duff below. Above us on the length of ground the dog drug us through  branches were snapped off clean up to 10 feet high on the trees. We made our way back to the main trail with no further incident. ,Off Highway 199 just south of the Oregon border.

674,Children found footprints on the beach of the bank of the Trinity River across from Tish Tang campground  south of Hoopa on Saturday  July 22. Al Hodgson of Willow Creek arrived Monday and saw tracks a shade over 16 inches long and 7.5 inches wide. There were  half a dozen  altogether  but some were hard to make out. The tracks looked authentic to Hodgson. Hodgson estimated the tracks were two weeks old at least.  The best ones were at the edge of the water. They led up from the beach and upstream  ending on bedrock. Only one was of quite good quality and showed a slight arch. There were no tracks of people except of those who had found the big tracks. Grass an inch high was growing in the tracks.  Hodgson had to swim the river to get to the site. , ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,no
675,I accidently wrote my experience down in the space that was supposed to be used to describe weather conditions. It was late afternoon  clear skies and good visibility although the tree canopy blocks out a good deal of sunlight from the forest floor.Look in the weather/time of day section for my report (sorry) I don  t type very well and haven  t the time to re-do everything. ,Like I said earlier  there is this gift shop that is completely contained inside a living redwood tree on the highway 101 ave of the giants scenic route. About 5 miles north of that is a small day use area with a small parking lot and restroom. I believe there are several trails leading out of there. We took the one to the north. It  s very heavily forested in the area and doesn  t seem to get much use although I cant  t be sure. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Spring ,6023,yes
676,Saw a form walking upright at a distance of 200+ yards. We were a little excited (more like scared shitless). There was enough light to just make out that whatever it was  was moving on two legs. We found where it had gouged out the soft earth on the stream it crossed. No discernible footprints  but whatever made the gouge was big. We had to WAG (wild-ass-guess) at the length  over 19 inches. It was longer than the tip of my extended fingers to my elbow. The grass going across the meadow didn  t allow for footprints but was pressed down several hours later. We didn  t follow the trail towards the trees!! It had been watching us for around 15 minutes  give or take 5. I was asleep when my friend woke me up. Said he heard something moving above us on the exposed rock above our camp. He had his 9mm (personal protection from the typical axe-murderer you meet while camping) in hand and was a little wound up. We listened to it move around with the occasional skip like someone was jumping a short distance to another rock. It moved behind us then down into the meadow that surrounded the stream we were camping on. We saw it cross the stream and slip as it went across on the other side. It moved across the meadow at a quartering angle away from us and into the tree-line. We know it wasn  t a bear. We had several run-ins with bears trying to get our food cache at night in Yosemite. Thought we would get away from the crowds on this backpacking trip. Good call  huh? Once we calmed down we discussed what we think we saw  we both came to the same conclusion. I know we didn  t halucinate. Our eyes had time to adjust before we finally got a visual of it moving across the meadow. We stayed awake until we had enough light to look the area over quickly and then beat feet out of there. ,Klamath National Forest  California (west of the Klamath River).

677,While on vacation driving down from Seattle we stopped and camped at KOA Fortuna July 1992.  On this trip was my wife and three children. We decided to get an early start the next day so we could drive through Humboldt Redwoods State Park with little or no traffic to enjoy the landscape without too much distraction.  We packed up and drove southbound as we approached an area of Hwy 101 were the Eel River makes a large bend towards the highway I saw movement down by the river.  My vantage point was above the animal I saw and I was driving slowly.  What I saw was a human like  creature  walking slowly away from the river across a rocky sandbar towards the forest.  The color appeared to be a reddish brown.  The creature walked with the same apparent gait as the creature seen in the Patterson film.  It wasn  t a bear  bears don  t walk with an apparent human type gait.  I talked to my wife after driving several miles down the road and prior to me asking her if she had seen anything unusal she said yes.  Later on my daughter who was sitting in the back also said that she saw the same creature.  I am a law enforcement officer and know that I saw  Bigfoot  - there is no doubt about it. , ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,yes
678,My friend and I went target shooting one day in the hills east of Arcata Ca in the Spring of 94.  The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut  but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn  t think anything of it  but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.

679,Had been riding horses with three other friends on the six hour loop trail and stopped for lunch where the outhouse is located at the one day trail junction. We were all sitting at the picnic table having lunch and was hearing much crashing in the brush. Not unusual sounds for there are elk everywhere in the park. We did notice however that a  bear  or something had an awfully good time with the outhouse toilet paper  as it was strung all over the place. We all were sitting there having lunch and I decided that I wanted to go see where the elk were  maybe see a big bull! So I got on my horse and rode down to where I heard the noise and the trail is cut out on an old logging road and a creek crosses through a culvert to the other side of the road and the water forms a small pool before moving on down into the larger creek below. I could not tell you how long I was sitting there on my horse watching this creature not more than 30   away trying to get a drink of water out of the pool. It was a challenge  as the sides to the pool were fairly steep. At first  I thought it was a man  then a monkey  and at last my brain registered what I was looking at! Then I seen the finger nail  and it was black and human like. I was looking at an adolescent  possibly baby Bigfoot! It never had a chance to turn and to look at me  as the horse I was on kept getting more and more upset the longer that I stayed there. I ran back on my horse to my friends and told them in a stuttered manner what I had seen! Just by the way I was acting they knew something was up  because I have been in the woods on horseback almost half of my life. The immeadiately followed me back to the area where I had seen what I described as a young adolescent Bigfoot. My friends did not ever see the creature  but they heard it as it walked away and seen the ferns moving as it rustled through them on its way down the hill to the larger creek. Never heard any sounds from him/her. My friend was going to follow and I cautioned her  because I believe that  Mom  was close by. The crashing in the brush we heard was not made by the adolescent looking creature  it was made by something much larger. The creature was silver-gray  had medium length hair (like a bear)  black human like fingernails  human like hands (I seen its thumb)  was totally covered in hair from top to bottom (I never got to see its face  it was always looking down). I never have told anyone about the sighting and made my friends promise not to say anything for quite a while. I explained that this was a young animal and to allow me to get this close was inexperience. And if I could get that close on a horse  than someone could get that close with a gun! It was not long after that there was a news report about a son and a father seeing a Bigfoot cross the road near Prarie Creek State Park. The news report was within a couple of weeks of my sighting  but still I kept my sighting to myself! ,On six hour loop trail for equines in the Redwood National Park  Orick ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,yes
680,A friend and I were camping and he walked to Founder  s Grove. He was on his way back when he heard a crash and a scream on the hill above the road  then another crash and then russling in the bushes closer to him. He stopped and waited. Nothing moved  but he said he could hear something breathing. I was about 1/2 mile away on the riverbed of the South Fork of the Eel River when I heard a very LOUD scream in the forest north of my position approximately in the area where my friend later told me his adventures occurred. ,Humbolt Redwoods State Park  Burlington Campgrounds  between Weott (north) and Meyers Flat (south)  Humbolt County  California. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Fall ,6023,no
681,I found a 3 toed footprint and a 13/2 inch footprint sometime after 6pm. I have plaster casts and footage of the prints before I made casts out of them. I fell asleep about 9 30 pm. While sleeping I was woken up to noises outside my tent. The first nise I heard were leaves being stepped on but I told myself it  s nothing a couple of times. I began to fall back to sleep when I started to hear it again but this time it was louder and heavier. The thing that started to get me concerned was the fact that I started to feel the vibration in the ground everytime it took a step (I was facing stomach down when I woke up) so I just layed there listening and all of a sudden the noises stopped  whatever was out there was breaking branches on the ground and I also heard a couple of branches breaking on trees. Then the noises started again  by then I ws starting to get scared because for one thing I couldn  t see outside my tent and the other thing was that I was alone. The noises stopped and I made up my mind to get outside  so I started to unzip the inside of the tent  as I did I tripped trying to get outside. By then I got up and turned on my flashlight on  spun around but seen nothing and smelled nothing. Whatever was out there didn  t make anymore noise but I knew whatever it is  was still there. I would estimate the noises were less than 30 feet away probarlly closer  that  s how close it was. I then grabbed my tent  ran with it to my truck and threw in the back  grabbed the rest of my stuff and I was gone!!!! ,Fish Lake  Humboldt County  Northern California.

682,It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County  it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But  I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so  I drove down to the river bar as described in the  Where did it occur?  section of this report. I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge  on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a  B  then bellow  Whoooooooop   wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard. To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park  I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition  I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric  CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That  s not what this was. Well  I didn  t think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river  seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn  t focus on it at first  I wasn  t sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad. As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again  I looked right into its eyes  they were dark  it didn  t move. I then saw another to its left  I could see its body from the thigh up  it didn  t move  it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn  t see its eyes. These things looked taller than a man  had flat faces and large round eyes  their shoulders were broad and their arms were long  they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area  like mange.  They stood still  never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look  the river was to high. As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car  at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area. I don  t follow Big Foot stuff  but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound  and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise  packaging the bones  and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I  m not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.  ,Glendale Drive in Blue Lake  CA runs parallel to Hwy 299.

683,It was about 2 00 a.m.  I was playing solitaire at the kitchen table when I heard a series of low  resonant yelling turning into high pitched screams. Immediately  I recognized the call as it has been described to me so many times by my dad and mom  and aunt and uncle. I  m 54 years old and I finally heard it! I  m thrilled! I  ll never forget it.

684,We were about a 1/4 mile up the trail from the river. We were walking relatively quiet and slow along the path when we stopped on the path for a moment for my son to tie his shoe. As I waited  I surveyed the thick redwood area above. As I looked  I noticed something moving about 150-200 feet in the distance next to a large old redwood stump. The more I looked  I began to see more mass of the creature. I finally realized what it probably was and what it was doing. It had a human-like torso (from the waist up) and it appeared as if it was scratching its back against the stump. I gained a back and profile view before I could no longer overcome the intense fear I was experiencing. I urged my son as serious as could  to run as fast as he could. After running for about thirty seconds to a minute  we stopped. I wanted badly to go back and investigate  but understood I could not do this with my son. I know the EXACT location of where the stump is and I plan to go back within the week. I hope to find something at the stump. ,My eight year old son and I were hiking the   Grasshopper Trail   in Humbolt Redwoods State Park  Burlington Campgrounds  between Weott (north) and Meyers Flat (south)  Humbolt County  California. The time was approximately between 3 and 4 p.m. on Sunday  August 22nd.

685,John Freitas of BFRO was kind enough to allow us to borrow his broadcasting sound equipment for the duration of our camping trip. We broadcast the alleged Sasquatch  screams  and  howls  throughout the next few days  including the Bluff Creek Road areas. Note  Before leaving the truck at the locked Forest Service gate  the Fish Lake Road  and hiking to Fish Lake  we broadcast two calls of each sound  the  scream  and the  howl . Coincidentally  our encounter occurred that same evening. At approximately 9 30 p.m.  we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party)  and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of  whistle  or double  whoop  (try whistling these syllables  WEEOOOU  WEEOOOU ) and it was immediately followed by a very intense  screech   which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman! Now  I grew up in the mountains of Montana  am familiar with many animals and their sounds  and have never heard anything like this in my life. And until this moment  I have wondered what it was like to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I have never felt this kind of reaction  I repeat -- NEVER. The sound sequence repeated itself again  followed by a third lone screech. Immediately  we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal  s eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on  we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner. Then at about 12 30 a.m. (just past midnight  with two of the teenagers already asleep)  we again heard the  whistle - whoop  immediately followed by the  screech   but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again  we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2 000 000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still  NOTHING. No movement  no eyes  nothing. After panning around the entire area once again  I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox  or kit fox. Well  for our needs  that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny  but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night. At approximately 5 30 a.m.  three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the  whistle - whoop  followed immediately by the intense  screech  and this followed again by a lone  screech . But  this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat  but agreed it  s just that darn kit fox again  and didn  t bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this  chased  it away)  but we then heard the same  whistle  and  screech  again  but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter. The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps. We did not SEE any movement or eyes of any kind and we did not SMELL anything at all. After hiking out of Fish Lake the next day  and driving back to the coast  we just didn  t feel right with our  kit fox  explanation. It just didn  t sit right with us. The sound was just too intense. Then  upon discussing the incident with John Freitas that same evening  he agreed with the idea that foxes almost NEVER even make sounds  much less something as nerve-wracking as that of the night before. On our trip back south  we stopped for a break and found a poster-type map discussing the numerous Bigfoot sightings and locations and in the accompanying paragraph it stated that  ... sounds associated with bigfoot encounters include whistles and shrieks similar to that of a mountain lion.  We welcome your feedback on discussing these sounds. ,Fish Lake Campground off of Bluff Creek Road; camp site #19 ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Spring ,6023,no
686,My neighbor is a seasonal wildlife biological technician for Redwood National Park.  He has been working several seasons doing Spotted Owl surveys and is very familiar with local wildlife. One evening just before sunset he and his partner were walking with a cage of six mice that had sat in the same cage without being cleaned for 3 or 4 days and it smelled to high hell. They were several miles south of Bald Hills Road at about 2 000 feet up an approximately 3 000 foot mountain in extremely rugged and isolated terrain several miles from the nearest logging road. After bushwhacking for about thirty minutes heading downhill they stopped in their tracks when they heard a large branch snap.  There are a lot of bears and mountain lions in the area and they are familiar with with stalking cats.  The creature was quick and agile like a cat but sounded heavier than a bear.  It also sounded like it was walking on two legs.  They would hear it behind them and a little later it would be way ahead of them  sometimes on the other side of them They figured it was crossing right behind them and then passing them up on the other side.  By this time it was getting dark in the forest  late twilight  when my friend started looking over his shoulder quite frequently.  It was at this time that he saw a large dark animal dash across their trail on two legs.  He has seen the P-G Film and is familiar with sasquatch and he says that it moved with the same motion  just much quicker. He also noted it seemed a little thinner than Patty. ,8 miles east of Stone Lagoon as the crow flies.  Extremely limited access as you must also cross Simpson and Nat For gates.

687,I didn  t get out of my car. I didn  t have my camera with me. I noticed a movement on the right of my car ahead of me. It was a large man-sized creature on two legs striding very fast (long strides)  then it ran very fast and jumped off an embankment. It was very heavy  a lot of dust was in the air when I passed the spot where he jumped off the embankment (where he jumped off was about twenty feet from the road). The creature looked brown and gold in the setting sun. ,Johnson  s Road off Bald Hills Rd off of Hwy. 101 near Redwood National Park in Humboldt County  CA.

688,On July 13 or August 17 of 2000 about 7 15 p.m. my  boyfriend  my 2 moth old baby  and I were headed back from Eureka  CA to Crescent City  CA. Somewhere past Trinidad and right before the lagoon we came around the corner on a four lane highway. Up ahead around 50 yards away a tall dark brown almost black  man  with long hair all over ran full stride across the highway. His arms hung long and the top of his neck seemed somewhat hunched over. The first thing that ran through my mind was  What  s a man doing running across the road right here?   I thought this because we were completely out in the middle of no where.  Then I yelled   That was bigfoot!  My boyfriend turned to me and said   shut up.  You  re playing with me.   I told him that he saw it with his own eyes.  By this time we had passed the point where he ran across the road into the forest  so we stopped and turned around.  We drove back to the point where he had re-entered the forest and stopped.  Peering into the thick forest it became too spooky for me and I drove off. I noticed where and when he chose to cross the road was very unique.  He waited until there were no cars except for ours which caught him off gaurd just comimg around the corner.  And where he crossed was flat.  It was the only place throughout the woods that didn  t have a little hill on either side of the highway.  Some of the people I have told of this ask if it was a bear  but there is no way it could have been at the speed he ran. ,There are a couple of lagoons a little after Trinidad when heading north.Right before getting to those there is a road on the left and the spot was about 1/4 mile after that road where the flat spot is on both sides of the road. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,yes
689,During the weekend of may 26th and 27th I was conducting a sound survey project with three other people near the town of Johnson and the Klamath River.   This area we were in had a sighting last year around the month of July. The place where we decided to set up was a recent clear-cut that ran along the hillside.   It was about 1000 feet wide and 1200 feet long.   On the edges were fir and oak trees that developed  a thick cover.   Running the width and centered in the clear-cut was a dirt road that the local people and loggers used on a daily basis.   It also provided us with a place to park and set up our sound equipment.   it also became base for our team. From our base  looking down into the valley about two miles we could see the town of Johnson.   From or point we were about 1500 feet above the river and town. Just prior to dusk  I had two members climb to the top of the clear-cut (about 150 feet in elevation and about 300 feet away from base).   I did this so if anything was to come closer to our base camp  they would have the best field of vision  and with their night vision device would be able to determine what it was.   We also had two way potable radios for the upper lookout and base. Manny and myself continued to set up the equipment and waited until nightfall. Because I was scheduled to participate at 10 00 PM in a live broadcast with Jeff Rense â€œSightingsâ€ program  I was insuring that my bag cell phone was working properly.   All the equipment checked out other than the phone worked but had some static in the line. At 9 40 we started to broadcast.   The sound traveled very well  and seemed to echo forever.   The location we were at easily helped the sound to travel well over five miles from valley to ridge top  and saddle  it covered a large area.   Very happy with the sound  we continued to broadcast a few more times before the Sightings show started. It was almost 10 00 PM when the phone rang  it was the Sightings show.   The show went fine for the first few minutes  but the static was getting horrendous  cutting Jeff Rense off completely at times.   About ten minutes into this show  Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection. I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line  with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down  not much protection in anyoneâ€™s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone  I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second  and again I heard this charging  that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didnâ€™t have a radio  as we were together at base camp and had to share two  one for base and one for the upper team). I asked the upper team â€œdo you see anythingâ€ and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out  as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny). The show continued on and I would hear footfalls  breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight  but didnâ€™t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was. Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety  not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  â€œJohn itâ€™s looking right at you  canâ€™t you see it  itâ€™s about 25 feet away  that ****** is hugeâ€.   My heart started pounding FAST  and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder. The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at  it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car  cell phone to one ear  and the other to the forest  I could hear it charge again  and thatâ€™s when they would say  â€œit went back into the treesâ€  this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes  with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others. This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking  lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life. That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition  it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area  it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view  it had several windows to look at me  and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me. You can listen to this event by going to sightings.com and clicking on archived shows.   Look for May 27th 2001.

690,On the day of the incident  a co-worker and myself where sent to close the Port-Orford-Cedar gates for the winter season.  Both of us are Forestry Techs and worked for Six Rivers Nat  l Forest (Seasonals).  As the day progressed and gates were closed we decided to take lunch at the Onion Lake area.  Once we got to the lake we had our lunch and rested in our own way.  I decided to walk around the lake to take my mind off things.  About half way round the lake I spotted something strange in the water  up the lake embankment  and into the forest.  I called to the co-worker.  We saw Bigfoot tracks that lead from the water into the forest.  I ran back to the truck and got a measuring tape and ran back to the tracks.  The tracks measured 14  long 5 1/2  wide.  The distance between the tracks were 3  .  We wrote down the track details in our IDEA pads (pocket note books) and then left the area to finish our work day.  We decide not to tell our supervisors because we thought our bosses would not believe us. ,Depending where you are coming from - Take highway 96 to the Fish Lake Road (13N01)  follow the road till you see a sign saying Onion Lake.

691,Would like to submit the following as the first two (likely Class B) findings on lower Bluff Creek  CA. resulting from three deliberate short  expeditions  to conduct night-surveillance and day-reconnaissance for evidence  While I was on leave from Army in July   96  my brother and I went to Bluff Creek for two nights. Our plan was to search the streambed for prints by day and listen and observe at night with 1st Gen. passive IR gear. We conducted about 6 hours surveillance per night  with nothing noted. Site #1  On second day (10? July) I was checking the north side of the streambed about 1/2 mile southeast of our campsite the (Wright Place) when I noticed a flat glade of trees on the south bank and walked across to investigate. After a few minutes in the glade I found a cedar tree with the top twisted off at the 7.5 to 8 foot level. Here the tree was about 2  thick. Most alarming was that the break  and part of the tree where bark was stripped off  looked moist and fresh; probably occurring overnight  given the dry  and warm conditions. The top of the tree  with a few feet of stripped bark was at the tree  s base. No hairs found. I took pictures and brought the top back to my brother. Later that day  at a second site (#2) about a mile northwest of our campsite  I found a 50 to70 meter  stretch with over 15 trees similarly broken off at between 4 and 8 feet off the ground. I took a few pictures of these. Over the Labor Day weekend that same year (31 August to 2 September) my wife and I returned to the area. I thoroughly photographed and cataloged the trees at site #2. We also drove a few miles north of #2  dropping down to the creek east off forest service road 13N01. There (#3) we found more tree breaks and a HUGE pile of dried feces; 2 + thick ropes with numerous undigested seeds and huckleberries. Most significantly it looked nothing like the abundant bear scat in the area  which was generally much less massive  purple/black and under 1  thick. Finally  as we were driving out of our campsite en route home  on forest service road 10NO6  we noticed by the side of the road (#4) a tree that looked like it had been violently twisted years earlier at the 9 to10 foot level and it continued to grow. We took a picture. NOTE  My interest in the Sasquatch started on the 7th of December 1979. I was a 12 yr. old passenger in my parentâ€™s car  when we saw one. (See database entries for Pierce County  Washington) ,Bluff Creek  4 to 5 miles (est.) upstream from confluence with Klamath River & Hwy 96. Our July campsite was at confluence of Serpentine & Bluff Creeks  about a mile north  northwest of Fish Lake Campground.  Our September campsite was just across creek near a possible abandoned gold prospecting site. USGS or Forest Service map  that I found later  shows this area labeled { Wright Place (Site) }.  #1 Was the fresh tree break found in a glade on the south side of creek about 1/2 mile southeast of our campsite which was just at the southwest of end of an eyot in Bluff Cr. shown on detailed USGS map. #2 We found multiple old tree-breaks just south of the creek  which was about 1 mile north west of our campsite  and was just south of an intermittent stream. #3 Over the Labor Day weekend  we found more tree breaks and a suspected Sasquatch feces pile which was found a few miles north  northwest of #2 and near a forest service access road just west of the creek. #4 A few miles south of a paved forest service road 11N05 on a gravel forest service road 10N06  was a meadow on the west side of the road  and there was a good view of Bluff Creek valley.

692,In 1978  I was alone and gold hunting up behind the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. I had to take a side trip across the mountain to avoid some heavy snow and brush. I found this trail that was going up the mountain  where their were large steps in the trail that were throwing my climbing stride off. At this point  this side of the mountain  that I was on  was bald and it was open ground with no trees or brush close by to hide behind. Suddenly  I had this very bad feeling. Then the hair on the back of my neck stood up straight up!  I never had that happen to me before or since.  I believe this happened for no other reason except fear.  I then left this out of stride trail. Actually  I ran off the trail feeling terrified of something that was coming down this same trail.  I only got a short way off  when I went down on my knees and covered my face and eyes with both hands and tried to hide. At that moment I heard an animal on two legs come down the trail  a few yards from me  it stop and it had to gaze right at me for awhile  then it continued on down the hill.  I didn  t look until after it left and continued on down the mountain out of sight. So  I never saw this animal.  I believe this creature was directing a silent feeling toward me  and I complied. At this point in my life  I had been a seasoned mountain man  and have had numerous encounters with many kinds of animals including bears and deer  day and night  but nothing like this. With no more fear I returned to the trail feeling fine. I thought of bigfoot right away. This time I paid close attention to detail.  There was no odor or smell  and the only odd thing was that the trail became fainter  as I continued to climb on up this mountain. I had expected this trail lead to somewhere  like a cave perhaps  but no  it just ended at a small meadow.  I looked all around  and I could see there was a lime stone ridge out-cropping in the distance  but no signs of a cave. This encounter was really something to remember  and it was my experience. There isn  t any need for the so-called experts to tell me anything  they will just have to get they  re own experience. Besides  they  re just not in the loop. ,I was prospecting for gold on the east side of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Spring ,6023,yes
693,I was reconing the area just southwest from Louse Camp near bluff creek this weekend on 6-21-03 I came across a single footprint in an old mud puddle the fotprint was 16 inches long and almost 6 inches across at the heel I didnt have any plaster with me but I did have my video camera and I shot some very good video footage of the footprint this was about 3/4 of a mile down stream from louse camp in the six rivers national forest about 24 miles out of orleans. ,it was aprox 3/4 of a mile down stream from Louse camp from HWY 96 go 17 miles up road 15N01 turn left on road 12N12 go about 4 miles and turn right on 12N13 follow that down to the bottom about 9 or 10 miles to louse camp. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,no
694,During the last week of June  my girlfriend and I decided to take the dogs on a long walk. We were driving up the coast planning on a beach walk when I decided to go to a area on redwood creek where my friend had heard some unusual and scary whistles and screams. He is a very experienced hunter and outdoorsman with a degree in wildlife biology and he had never heard anything like it. Anyway  we were walking up the north bank  where the trails are  when I decided to cross to the south bank to check out some sandbars. I loaded up my girlfriend on my back and waded across. We then continued upstream a shortways when we came across three distinct footprints. They were approximately 14 1/2 inches long. I measured them with a stick that I saved. I compared them with my own barefoot track for depth and they were nearly twice as deep. I weigh about 280 lbs. I was surprised that they weren  t wider  they were almost narrow for their length. I at first thought they were human because of this.  The best print had 5 very distinct toes and was flat  no arch at all  with toes straighter across than a normal human. It appeared that it had just leisurely walked into the creek. I scoured up and down for an exit point but the terrain wasn  t suitable for tracks other than the odd sand bar. The strides were about 4 feet. It had come across a packed gravel bar leaving a few faint impressions. Nothing else observed. , ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,no
695,Last Sunday (November 16  2003) My friend  my dog and I traveled from Portland  OR to Northern California for some late season backpacking. We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans  CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6 00pm  as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host  and as we approached the host  s site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So  we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive  skunky  odor  but thought nothing of it at the time. Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside)  get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible  as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear  however  I heard some distinct  hoots  from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like  but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that  but he had not  as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp  seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again.  There.  I said   Did you hear it that time?   No.  he responded  but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of  hoots .  What do you think that is?  he asked. I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness  having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally  academically and recreationally  but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So  being educated and reasonable  I declined to respond. As we continued  we began hearing other noises. First we heard  whacking  sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this  hooting  and  whacking  as a less-than-friendly display  we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up  moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark  while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So  we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area. The  whacking  continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked   What do you think that is?  I gave the guarded response   I  ll tell you what  I  ve spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals  but I  ve never heard anything like this.  I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response  given the ubiquitous usage of the word  Bigfoot    and images thereof  in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive. Shortly before turning in for the evening  I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside  in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did  however  with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the  whacking ; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would  however  periodically hear closer and clearer  whacks  from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm  whack  from our South/Southwest. I awoke  once  at approximately 3 00am and heard distinct  single-note  whistles  from the general direction of the distant  hollow  whacking  which were  again  decidedly unbirdlike  yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a  crack  followed by loud rockslide  terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other  smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual  whacking ) we eventually slumbered down again  awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings. In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep  rocky and slightly parabolic in shape  and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite  leading us to conclude that  1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the  amphitheater  hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank  they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion  they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that  skunky  smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk. At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger  s Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease  but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully. We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday  Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open  flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway  layed out equipment for drying  then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides  and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large  humanlike foot from the heel (about 4  in width) to a point about 6  forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found  however  no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression. That night  back at the campground  we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point   my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate  but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night. We returned home however with a new awareness. ,Aikens Creek campground  immediately West of Bluff Creek on HWY 96 ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Fall ,6023,no
696,On July 5  2004  my brother and I went on a sasquatch expedition to the Bluff Creek area of Humboldt County California. The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp  takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m  just as it got dark  we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud  very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said  WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT ? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness  another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m  we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was  it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would  ve left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did  nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts  they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example  the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts  they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek  I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment  a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud  very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself  thats what we heared at Onion Lake . The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone  roughness  length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5  2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I  m not a scientist or expert on grunts  but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County  California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5  2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there. ,At Arcata  California take Highway 299 East.

697,Well this was just supposed to be a fishing trip to see what the area had to offer.  I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnâ€™t get lost. I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers  and what to use. Iâ€™m from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast  so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river  where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to  so I was a little excited about this new area. I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump  seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isnâ€™t that bad  but I still need them for driving.  But  I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter  plus it might have been a bear. But  being the idiot that I am  I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards  because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up  and I didnâ€™t know up until that point how big it really was. Now  I had a roommate who was 6  7â€ and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7  6â€ tall  and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second  but when it turned  it didnâ€™t run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so  but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair  and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river  and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didnâ€™t move for a good bit  because I was in shock.  After the creature had left  I did the same  once I could get my feet working again. ,Going north on 101  take 254  and once you turn onto 254  off to the left  I pulled in and parked. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Spring ,6023,yes
698,Well it has been a couple of years since it happened  but here goes.  I was stationed at Beale AFB  Ca.  and I would always drive around looking for the next great fishing hole.  I had been driving for quite some time and had decided to pull into Humboldt Redwood State Park.  Being from Alabama  I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool. So  I got off of Hwy 101 and took the Avenue of the Giants exit.  Driving down the road I was amazed at the size of the trees  so they kind of grabbed my attention. I started seeing a lot of places where I was thinking I could fish  so I started to slow down even more to find a place to park.  As I kept driving the river kind of started getting a little farther away  and I was about to turn around. When out of no where something walked across the road  and to say the least it shocked the you know what out of me.  The reason why it got me a little jumpy was because of the fact that I had to have come within a couple of feet of this thing.  Now I  m a pretty big guy 6   and about 220 Lbs.  but what ever walked in front of my truck had to have been over 7 feet tall  due to the height of the truck (Chevy Z71). Now when it comes to the poundage of this thing I would have to say it was well over 350 lbs.  As far as physical features all I saw was the back and arm swing. The thing never turned around for me to get a better look at it.  But it had a large back and rather long arms.  As far as the neck goes it didnâ€™t really have one.  The animalâ€™s traps made it look like it didnâ€™t have a neck.  Kind of like me. But after I did find a place to turn around  I went back to look around  dumb I know  to say the least.  I only found a couple of tracks. They had to have been 14 to 15 inches long  plus the stride of this thing was a lot longer then mine. Just to make the stride this thing did  I had to make one heck of an effort.  Now all I can say is what ever I saw that day was nothing like anything I had ever seen in the woods  and I grew up in the outdoors. ,Well not knowing the area that well  the only way I can remember the area is if I saw it again  sorry. ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Spring ,6023,yes
699,I have spent a lot of time in the woods. I was a climber for ten years and I have heard it all out there. This was different. I was with my sons. We all wanted to camp in a bigfoot area  so we we went to a campground near Bluff Creek.  We were all in the tent and in our bags  the camp had settled down and all of a sudden there was a whoop! They were loud as if behind us  in succession whoop whoop bah-whoop!! And it seemed that there was more than one  I estimate three  one to the left of us  one behind us  and one off in front at a distance.  Also  something either took a large step or jumped off something  and it was big. The one behind us would call first and the one off in the distance would call back. The one to the left would whoop once  but the one behind would whoop three times and the others once or twice. At the start of the whoops would be almost a pucker or click sound. I figure the one behind us was the lead because he would call out and they would answer. After about ten minutes the lead creature started to move off with the one to the left towards the other. I wanted to look out the tent but my youngest was with me who is 6 and was real scared  because the calls were so loud. I stayed with him and did not get to look till it was over. I found no evidence in the morning  but earlier that day I noticed there were markings on a tree that was not made by a bear  almost as if the bark had been picked off. I have always followed this phenomenon and believed there was a possibility. This solidified everything. ,[Location specifics removed] ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,yes
700,My friend and I were backpacking in the Redwood National Park  north of Eureka  on [a particular trail in the National Park]. We started hiking at about 3 in the afternoon  and hiked for a few hours. Then we walked off the trail up into a small canyon for about half a mile and made camp. Found bear tracks  started to get worried  so we hung our food from a tree. About this time (7 o  clock) we heard the first scream. It was short  and didn  t repeat. We started to get a little freaked out  so we started a fire  and heard nothing for the next 3 or 4 hours. Then at about 10 30 11 00 p.m. the screaming started again  this time lasting for about 10 minutes. It sounded like it was about half a mile away on one of the surrounding ridges  a very eerie wail.  It didn  t sound human.  I know what elk  coyote  and wolf calls sound like  and this was nowhere near... very similar to recordings I have heard of supposed bigfoot calls.  We went to bed at about 2 a.m.  and left the next morning without incident. ,[Editors   Note  Location details removed.

701,Heard very unusual gutteral howling at dawn last week while camping in Humboldt State Redwoods. Howling lasted about 3  minutes. Then started up again several minutes later (but further up the stream  so not as loud) The second set of howling was follwed by baby-type screaming (small Puma maybe?) ,[edited -- location details removed] ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,no
702,this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10 30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good. , ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Fall ,6023,yes
703,We heard loud  prolonged screams every morning between 8/11/2007 and 8/18/2007.  The screams sounded like some kind of unknown  wild animal but with some added enunciation and vowel sounds that were very human like. The scream had an  O  sound in the middle and ended with a definite  R  sound. ,Edited- location details removed ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Summer ,6023,no
704,On Wednesday  February 20  2013  I was driving with three other women to Trinidad  California  to attend a 3-day quilting event.  With me in the car were Gloria Y. in the front passenger seat  my sister Jeanette Williams  and my sister in law  Carmen T.  in the back seat. It was close to 5 00 p.m. when we arrived in the Trinidad area on highway 101.  However  I missed the exit for Trinidad and had to drive up to the next one to go back.  I couldnâ€™t get back on the highway there  so had to turn south onto Patricks Point Road to get back to Trinidad. The sun was shining through the trees.  As I drove  someone stepped out onto the road in front of me.  He wasnâ€™t dangerously close  but close enough to cause me to slow down and say something along the lines of â€œWhat an asshole!â€  As I got nearer to him  my first thought was  â€œHeâ€™s really tall.â€  My second thought was  â€œWhat is he wearing?  Heâ€™s got something on that is solid black from head to toe  and there arenâ€™t any lines to denote a jacket  or a collar or pant legs.â€ He appeared to be in silhouette  with the sun behind him.  He was walking east to west.  My next thought was  â€œHis arms are down to his knees!â€ Lastly  I thought he was trim  with broad shoulders like Michael Phelps.  He was totally smooth. However  I could not see his face. He seemed to be looking away from us. He was walking with a purposeful stride  and didnâ€™t take very many steps to cross in front of us. It only took a few seconds for me to reach the spot he crossed.  I looked right  where he would have stepped off the road  and all there was  was thick brush and trees.  I had expected a path or clearing  if he was going to cross there  because on the left where he stepped out was forested land  right next to some sort of fire station  a white building with an American flag on a flagpole. At any rate  we all wondered  â€œWhat was that!â€  And Bigfoot came to mind. After we got settled into our motel rooms  we compared our impressions. My sister  Jeanette Williams  decided to make a report to the BFRO.  She entered a report onto the BFRO website. Sometime after we had returned home  someone from BFRO called Jeanette to ask her to repeat her story and to invite us to a town hall meeting being held that spring.  It was too far for us to go back.  My sister and Carmen had work commitments  so we didnâ€™t go. ,[Investigatior (MM) Note  The figure crossed Patrick Point Road roughly 100-200 feet north of the CAL FIRE Trindad Forest Fire Station  which is one mile north of the town center of Trinidad.

705,You would be interested in what happened to me a year ago  and twice more in 24 hours  just 2 weeks ago  near the Humboldt Mendo County headwaters of the Matole River. I am absolutely convinced that some unknown animal exists here so I began on the internet a search for similar accounts.  While immersed in the Internet searching it became clear to me that your organization should have this most recent information in a timely manner. Last July 2018  I was staying in a very isolated region  which had very limited access  behind 3 locked gates and 20 miles south of Whitethorn  CA  on a primitive 4x4 road.  This place is at the end of the world  on the northern border of a vast green belt spreading from Shelter Cove on the coast  east to Highway 101   and south to Fort Bragg  and east to Piercy  as can be seen on Google Earth. About 3 a.m. I was awake  it was a hot and dark night in these mountains.  Something above my tent location  approximately 200-300 meters  began knocking on wood  best described as loud whacks on a tree trunk by a big club or branch.  It started with one knock  which got my attention  with a brief hesitation  then several more knocks  but randomly timed  some in succession  others after hesitations.  The knocking was loud  so loud that it echoed down the canyon. The event lasted only a minute or two. My first thoughts were that there was no one on the mountain who could be out here in the middle of a primitive and protected area.  These knocks were obviously from something large  and no North American animal could have made them.  I listened intently while my mind tried to wrap around how the noise was made.  The woods were silent  not even a cricket.  I told a few locals afterward and learned that there were other hotspots for squatch sightings between Piercy and up to Willow Creek. Flash forward to two weeks ago  when waiting at the first locked gate to this same conservation area  I heard two distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained. As I waited in the dusk for about 45 minutes  waiting to meet a party at the gate who were running late  I heard a very loud wail/ scream/ call that I  ve never heard before in nature.  The call of this thing I located at about my 2 o  clock  facing east  and up the heavily wooded area above me  about 200-300 meters.  I instantly knew where I had heard such an unfamiliar call....about 3 years ago when watching a Bigfoot reality show  where these squatch hunters were making this strange/unique call while searching for Bigfoot. There was a few second delay from the first call  then a few more  then silence for about a minute  leaving me to wonder if this whole experience was real  pondering what I know about the wilderness  either that was an unknown animal or some kind of implausible prank.  It was loud  echoing down the mountain  as though some huge creature could belt like the lungs of Pavarotti  only much louder!  The chance of it being a prankster waiting in silence with me for 45 minutes in that remote location  just to hang out in these impenetrable woods and prank me  went away very quickly when  when another call out at about 3-400 meters to the north of the first  approx my 8 o  clock.  It was also just as loud  just as unique as the first  but came only 3 calls in succession  u-ah-o  u-ah-o  u-ah-o  with a distinct higher pitch on the  ah .  This absolutely blew my mind  because the first call might be an elk on steroids  but the response from what was clearly not an owl  brought chills down my spine.  This was some kind of communication between two individuals  neither which can be explained by any rationale. I must tell you that I have trekked and lived in remote areas in Africa  Australia  central and south America  many places of potential danger  and never had an inkling of fear.  I was born and raised near Yellowstone Park  with 100 times the average distance trekked by most individuals in their lifetime  and never had bad experiences with grizzly  mountain lions and wolves.  Travelling all these years with a firm understanding of ecosystems  I never could have believed in such mysteries  that anything new would ever be discovered. I had a fourth experience  which I must say something about  but it happened just the night before the dual vocalizations. On Friday evening  Nov 1st  2019  I had just moved into a cabin that my brother and I rented  located along an extremely rugged canyon area of the Matole River.  It was dusk  quite dark already in the forest.  I was outside looking at the stars  taking in the newness of these rugged surroundings.  Up above  again about 300 meters up and to the east of the river  there was a screaming that was so loud and so foreboding that I could only listen in amazement.  It was the loudest screaming I  ve ever heard  so loud I thought it was produced by some kind of banshees from a horror film. The screams continued  full throttle  for over 5 minutes.  I know mountain lions can scream  but nothing like this. It sounded much louder  more guttural  literally as if someone had set up a loud speaker and played the bloodiest scream that Hollywood could produce.  At the time  the night after Halloween  I wondered if someone was up on the mountainside pranking me as a newcomer to the neighborhood. I listened for a bit  then went inside and told my brother about it because it was so unnerving.  Bigfoot did not even enter my mind.  But then at dusk the next evening I witnessed these 2 calls waiting at the gate. I have since been over and over in my mind  why have I been so lucky as to hear or experience such mystery?  Much less 3 distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained.  I began pouring over USGS maps and satellite imagery to ascertain what the link may be  20 miles apart  are there any people or neighbors or access for individuals in the areas I experienced which may explain these?  Could one individual in such obvious stress on one night  have triggered the coincidental travel of at least 2 more unknown creatures the very next night?? I have talked to many locals about hearing strange noises  but no one claims anything  or they don  t want to be ridiculed. Look  I am a man  60 yo  with extensive wilderness experience in forests and jungles all over the world.  The closest thing to new species discovery for me was the Costa Rican jungles  but my mind has always been as a skeptic observer  dealing in evidence based biology as a science.  What has happened to me recently has completely changed me!  There is a mystery in these woods  and I have a few ideas how to answer them. Please feel free to contact me  if you would like access to these remote locations.  And I am very curious if other people in my area are having similar experiences.  Something unexplained to science lives out here  and I am beside myself with these recent events. Troy Hunter   troy.hntr@gmail.com.

706,I was driving home from Brookings Oregon on 1-23-21. I was south bound on highway 101 south of Garberville  Ca and south of the Benbow Inn.  The road makes a few turns and the speed limit drops in the area. As I rounded a sweeping right hand turn I saw a figure on the south bound shoulder of the highway. I was the only vehicle in the area about 8 15 PM.   My speed was about 45-50 MPH as I passed the figure. The figure was laying on the shoulder of the road on its right side. I estimated the height to be about 7â€™. I was looking at the creatures back and noticed it had broad shoulders and was thick torso shape. While the shape similar to a human it was not human. It was not a bear either. I could see muscular features in its glutes and a head on the shoulders that was somewhat tapered toward the top and being held off the ground. Itâ€™s hair was a chocolate brown and very course. The hair was not fur like of a  bear at all. I turned around a distance past the spot and returned to where I had seen it.  No other vehicles had gone north or south from the time I saw the creature to the time I returned to its location (2 minutes estimate). When I got to the spot where I had seen it  the creature it was gone. As an avid hunter and fisherman I spend a lot of time in the woods. I spent every summer camping in that area as well as a kid. I have never seen anything like what I saw just this evening. ,[Investigator Notes  Longitude / Latitude  40.035268  -123.787606] ,Humboldt,50,California ,CA,Winter ,6023,yes
707,This is to document my experience on Sunday  June 6  2021. Something woke me up from dreaming.  I was dreaming I was trying to sleep but there was noise outside so in my dream I got out of bed and went to my window and pulled back the curtain.  I started tapping on the window to let whoever was outside know they were being noisy and disrupting my effort to try to sleep.   After my third tap on the window  I woke up from my dream and realized I had to go to the bathroom.  I got up and made my way to the toilet.  My bedroom window was open and my bathroom window was open.  Just before I flushed  I heard a faint noise  and I started to think it was a motorcycle coming around the bend on the highway  and in that second I thought to myself â€œWho would be riding a motorcycle this early in the morning?â€. Then  the noise got louder and drawn out  and had a deep vibrating howl  and then it stopped.  I realized then that it was something I have never heard before and it was not human.  It sounded like it was on one of the mountains behind my house. Afterwards  I noticed there were no dogs barking  not even my dogs  and there werenâ€™t even any crickets.  It was dead silence outside.  I was telling myself  oh my god  did I just hear what I think I heard?  I headed back to bed and noticed the clock said 3 33am. I asked my husband if he was awake. He had been snoring when I was in the bathroom.  I told him I had just heard something.  I explained the sound to him and I said I think it was a Bigfoot.  I could not believe what I had heard.  I could not sleep for over an hour  and we laid in bed waiting for more howling but there was none. The next day when I told everyone in the house  nobody had heard it.  Later Sunday morning  I used my cell phone to google different animal sounds to try to find the same howl I heard.  I tried Mountain lion  Wolf  Fisher  Fox  and none of them are in the least bit similar.  Then  I googled Bigfoot howls.  Oh my god! The 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl is almost exactly what I heard.  I got chills when I listened to it.  I played the recording to my household  and my oldest adult son recognized the sound also.  He as well as a few of his friends have had a few experiences too  including a rock being thrown at him. He has the rock in his bedroom.  I phoned my other family members and told them what I experienced and my mom told me that there was a post on facebook about a week earlier from someone that lives a few blocks away from me.  She was returning home late at night near the local dump (between Hoopa and Willow Creek  California).  Apparently  she thought she saw something near the highway and so did the car behind her as the other car turned around and drove back.   This location is only a couple of mountains away from where my home is located.  I figure the Bigfoot traveled to Hoopa from the dump site. I have lived in this area (Weitchpec and Hoopa  CA) almost my entire life and I have never  ever heard such a howl.  I think about the experience daily  but I actually feel fortunate to have witnessed this rare creature howling.

708,Weâ€™ve been hiking a local trail in Redcrest  CA for the last 19 years called the Drury-Cheney trail. This is a trail that we hike regularly; Iâ€™m talking like 3-4x a week. Itâ€™s always a family affair me (30 years old)  my son (2)  my mom and dad (50â€™s). In the summer we hike the trail nearly everyday. Weâ€™ve never  ever gotten the creeps in those woods. The last two hikes have really changed that. After todayâ€™s hike has me thinking that we may not ever go back  Iâ€™m not sure. We were hiking along  gabbing and visiting. It takes us quiet awhile to finish up an otherwise quick trail because my son (whoâ€™s two) really sets the pace. We were nearly done  on our way out when a loud....and Iâ€™m talking loud....yell/scream/guteral screetch echoed through the woods. My family and I have grown up in the Redwoods  weâ€™ve heard everything that nature has to offer in the way of animal sounds. It wasnâ€™t a raven  a fox  a bear  a lion  a deer bleet  a chipmunk  or a hawk. It was sounded like a human  but the fact that it traveled through the woods so clearly and loud really shook all of us. Todayâ€™s sound was nothing weâ€™ve ever heard before. It was LOUD and defined. It was just far enough in the distance for whatever it was to get its point across without making us petrified. It stopped my mother  me and my son in our tracks. There was no doubt that we all heard the same thing. My dad was talking and didnâ€™t hear it this time  but my dads hard of hearing and doesnâ€™t hear the best at certain tones. When we told him what we heard  he said he knew exactly what we were talking about because it happened last time he hiked the trail with my mom. We all got the feeling that we were being watched and that feeling didnâ€™t go away until we started driving off. When we got back home my dad shared that heâ€™s  heard that sound before and heard it the last hike before . For that particular hike  he took with my mom only. My dad said he hadnâ€™t said anything before because he didnâ€™t know what it could be and didnâ€™t want to scare us. He said that through the the last few hikes he could feel that we were being watched  hearing things move in the brush and feeling like something was wrong the last few hikes. I donâ€™t know it could be exactly. Weâ€™re no stranger to Bigfoot stories here in the PNW  but this time was a strange one for sure. ,From the south  drive 51 miles north of Leggett on Highway 101 to exit 667 in Redcrest.

709,I was riding in a car full of fellow teenagers out in the country just laughing  talking  and goofing around. It was a moonlit night  and we were foolishly driving without headlights  sometimes stopping  and then continuing on with or without headlights. The car was quite full with perhaps 6 people total in the car  three of which were in the front seat. I was sitting in the passenger seat nearest the door  and I remember having very little room to move. At one point we were driving very slowly with the headlights off  and then the driver suddenly turned the headlights on. I can  t remember now if he had seen something or had just randomly turned the headlights on  but as he did  those of us in the front seat saw a huge beast coming up and out of a dry irrigation ditch. This was one of those big ditches about 6 or 8 feet deep and perhaps 10 feet wide. The creature was slightly in front of us and to the right of the car about 20 feet off the road. We were immediately stunned (mainly because we thought we were all alone out in the country)  and so the driver hit the gas and we sped away. I don  t think anyone got a very good look at it except me  due to the fact that I was pinned against the passenger door and window. I was so scared  but continued to look as we passed by. What I saw scared me beyond belief. It appeared to be a huge man with dark hair covering its body  and with a leathery face. We had obviously startled it too  because it stood still  it  s eyes wide and it  s mouth open  almost as if it was growling or screaming. I could not see what it did once we had passed. Discussion in the car afterward included talk of a werewolf or other horror film creature  or perhaps of a man dressed in a gorilla-like suit. This did not look like a costume to me  and if it was  the man underneath was very large  though I can  t make any estimates on just how tall. At the time  we had not heard of Sasquatch  or if anyone had  it was not mentioned as a possibility. I only report this incident upon the urging of a friend  who has become interested in tracking Bigfoot sightings in Colorado. I personally dismissed the event as unexplained  though I did not feel it was a hoax. ,Rural road in Weld County  just west of Greeley  Colorado ,Weld,1,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8123,yes
710,In the summer of 1977 my brother and I had ridden up to the top of Pikes Peak on the cog railway. We made it to the top around noon  ate at the snack bar and headed down the West side with our backpacks for a few days of fishing the high country streams and beaver ponds. We picked our way down the steep slope and reached the treeline about about an hour later. As we hiked thru an opening we noticed something about a half mile away in a large meadow. At first I thought it was two people walking down the sloping hillside  one above the other. When we pulled up our binoculars we realized that it was an unusually tall  dark  hairy creature with exceptionally long arms and a very long stride. We watched it move downhill into the trees in approximately 10-15 seconds.We were both stunned and couldn  t believe what we had seen. Neither one of us thought pull a camera out of our packs  it happened so fast. After we got over the initial shock we went on down to a small lake  set up camp and spent an uneventfull night. We hiked on down for the next two days  fishing and camping without any further sightings. We never did hear any sounds from the creature and it didn  t appear to be the least bit concerned by our activity. ,Below the treeline on the west side of Pikes Peak looking toward the north in the direction of Horsethief Park. ,Teller,9,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8119,yes
711,This incident happend in southwest Colorado in early spring/late winter 1989. I worked at the Gladstone mine North of Silverton Colorado and lived in Montrose Colorado. I usually car pooled with another individual at the time and we took turns rotating driving every other day I.E. we took my truck one day and his the next. We did this four days each week for two weeks on day shift and two weeks on swing shift. Anyway to get to the story and sum it up. I  ended up driving to work by myself that particular day because my car pool did not show up in time making me a little late or behind our normal time of leaving.  Whoever was driving in the morning had to be alert and wide awake because of all of the deer and elk along the road and crossing the road that early in the morning. The commute south on 550 from Montrose to the mine took about one and half hours which is about seven miles north and west of Silverton CO. I had just come over Red mountian pass going south bound on 550 and just south of the Ophir Pass 4 wheel rd turn off about two miles and north of the east turning curve towards Silverton about one and half miles. As I was approaching what is known as the slide area I was on a relative short stretch of straight away and approching some S curves now at the time you could see across these S curves to the other side in which the road on the other side is in line with the first straight away and continues for a short way before a slight curve to the left that starts downhill. I had my head lights set slightly higher and wide  then stock on that 1985 Toyota 4x4 with rectangle Halogen headlights so that my truck would have a better chance of stopping or avoiding any collisions with a deer or an elk. DID I HAVE ADIQUATE LIGHTING? YES. Anyway as I am on the first straight away I could clearly see across to the second straight away when I saw movement up on this high embankment to the left on the second straight away about fifty feet above the highway and moving down the almost eighty foot tall and almost vertical embankment. What i saw was not clear until it came directly into the path of my head lights which were on bright by then. It was standing upright and took about four steps from the embankment to the other side of the 2 lane highway and paused slightly in front of a 12 foot or taller big yellow diamond shaped sign that warns of the slide area ahead. it appeared that this creature was slightly blinded or confused by my head lights and paused with two small quick shuffeling steps and a slight glance in my direction before it dropped over the steep embankment on the west or right side of the highway. when that thing stood in front of the yellow sign on that white post at first I thought it was a huge bear and then relized that bears do not travel around on 2 legs and 10 to 11 foot tall bears are not in exsistence in that area. I saw the glare of its eyes at least three times. It walked upright the whole time. Because of its height  gait and posture  slightly slouched forward above mid back   and its dark multi coloring I always believed that I saw a bigfoot. I tried to confide to a couple of friends what I had seen later that morning at work but I was met with a skeptical attitude. Therefore I began to keep it to myself and only have discussed it with close people and still have met resistance in talking about it. The time of day was early morning about 5 30 in the morning  dark and little or no moon. The weather was clear and tempurature mid 30 degrees. I did slow down at the crossing site and looked over the west side of the road as best I could briefly but hurried off in fear. After work I drove back by the crossing site and stopped. I noticed 5 or 6 large indentations  all in a row coming down the east embankment. It is very steep  with gray shale and dirt. The trail was at a slight angle at about 5 oclock.  These appeared to be heel marks like a human would leave descending a very steep slope but much much larger  disturbing the earth around them in a downward sliding motion around each track. I was and still am an avid rifle and archery hunter as well as an experienced tracker and outdoorsman and have hunted and camped excessivly in south western Colorado and the san juan mountains. To me it would be a great relief to have it proven to the world that these creatures exist and should and could be studied with great restraint so as not to disturb them too much. I believe that it will be just a matter of time befor their exsistence is proven to the world. ,see report ,San Juan,12,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8111,yes
712,After an unsuccessful days elk hunting trek of many miles around the heavy timbered area near the Rabbit Ears pass region  my Uncle Bill  Cousin Charles and myself  decided to call it a day and head back to our camp in the Walton Creek Campgrounds. About four miles south of our camp  as we were talking softly together while we walked  a loud crashing noise behind us came to our attention. My Uncle  an experienced hunter and woodsman of many years  replied that it sounded like we had spooked a large bull elk. Having accustomed ourselves to the area over the last few days  we knew that a deep canyon running through that location about 3 hundred yards in the direction the animal was moving would slow it down. Thinking that we could possibly get a fair shot as it crossed this canyon below us  the three of us started in pursuit. The animal was obviously spooked and running  as the sounds of its progress through the dense aspen trees and pines ahead  were easy to hear. After a laborious and exhausted chase through the heavy timber  the three of us broke out upon the canyons edge expecting to see the  Bull Elk  crossing the canyon bottom below us. The canyon in mention  runs in a south westerly direction  dry bottomed and is sparsely treed do to its steep sides. It is approx. a hundred yards deep  narrow sided  approx. 50 yards across the bottoms  with a heavy foliage of brush averaging 3 to 4 feet high. Trying to catch our breath  we were amazed that no elk was in sight below us running across the bottoms. After a few seconds I was alerted to the sound of rolling rocks across the canyon from me. As I looked up horizontally and directly across the canyon from me  I spotted what I at first believed to be a very large Black Bear running up the steep sided canyon. The opposite canyon rim was slightly higher than the side upon which we stood. The distance was approximately 200 yards. Startled  I called out to my companions attention the animals location  raising my rifle to view the animal through my rifle scope. After losing a second or two while I located the animal in my scope I was stunned. The creature was running up the steep hill on two feet. It was cover completely with what appeared to be matted  shaggy course black hair. The full back  shoulders  buttocks and legs were turned to me. The back of the head appeared to be hunched slightly foreword and without apparent neck visible. The back of the head was round skulled with no dome shape visible. Through the scope  I did not see the arms or hands  as they were directly in front of the creature and blocked from my view by its body. After later reflection  I believe the creature was using brush and limbs in its path to help pull itself up the incline. After approx. ten seconds the animal reached the top of the opposite canyon. Without pausing  I saw the creature turn slightly at the hips  presenting its right shoulder to me and peer sideways across at us as it disappeared through the trees. I clearly observed the facial features through the scope. The face was flat  small mouthed and thinned liped. The nose was flat with large nostril flares. The eyes appeared to be intelligent  what I would call a knowing look  black  slightly wide apart and set below a low brow ridge. The face seemed to be lighter in color  possibly tan or light brown and hairless with a leathery appearance. The sighting was of approx. ten seconds or less. After a moment of startled silence  the three of us compared notes about what we saw and discussed our options about what to do. All three us immediately decided against trying to follow it. One  It was late in the day and its trail ran in a direction away from our camp. Two  Even though all three of us were armed with high caliber rifles  none of us believed that we wanted to get too close to the animal. Three  As all three of us were experienced hunters  we knew that we could not shoot what ever it was in any case  as it was too close in resemblance to a human and we did not kill anything unless it was for food. However  we were excited about seeing a creature that none of us had ever seen before and decided to back track it towards our camp area in order to get a better idea about what we had seen. As the creatures trail was very easy to find due to torn brush and tree limbs in its passage  we followed it for about 3 miles to where it emerged out of the forest  crossing US Highway 40  where it continued back into the forest on the other side. Due to the lateness of the day and exhaustion we abandoned the trail and returned via the highway back to camp. Observations  It was apparent that we had startled the animal about 350 yards north of the canyon where we had skirted a wide patch of brush. We had passed within a few yards from this creature as our own tracks were clearly visible. After examining the area closely the following day it became obvious that animal had been taking its time wandering around through the thicket foraging for service berries  acorns from the scrub oak and wild currents. We believed the animal had become aware of our approach and had lain down in the brush waiting for us to pass  then in a state of panic had fled the area in great haste. All along the creatures path form this thicket to the canyon  brush and large tree branches had been disrupted by a great deal of mass and force. Judging from 3 to 4 inch thick tree limbs 7 to 8 feet above the ground  the creature stood apprx. 71/2 to 8 feet tall  which coincided with our judgment at the time of the sighting. The ground through out the area was covered in fall leaves and pine needles or else frozen and rock covered  leaving a poor surface for track impressions. However in several wash out areas the creature hand left a few clear enough scattered tracks for us to get a measurement. For the most part the animal appeared to have traveled in a wandering action  leaving tracks of 15 3/4 inches. From one impression it was discovered that the creature was missing the little toe from its left foot. It was judged by my uncle  an experienced game tracker of 40 years  that the creature had weighed upwards of 350 pounds. Once the creature had taken flight  it had traveled rapidly with over 7 foot strides  oblivious to obstructions  crashing directly through brush and trees. At one point the creature had hurtled a fallen tree about four feet off the ground  apparently without braking stride  leaving a deep impression in the torn soil upon landing on the other side. No hair strands or scat signs were found. Conclusion  The following day a report was made to a Colorado State and Game officer checking hunters in the area for licensees and game kills. The officer seemed skeptical at most and unwilling to check out the physical evidence. In his professional opinion it was only a bear and possibly a combination of hunting nerves. He also warned us about the use of alcohol while accompanied by fire arms. Needless to say we were offended by the way the report was received and by the accompanied remarks. In the final analysis the three witnesses concluded  A. The animal had definitely not been a bear or any other animal that they were familiar with. B. The creature stood approx. 71/2 to 8 feet tall and weighed in at approx. 350 pounds. C. The creature had been bipedal. ,4 miles SW of Walton Creek Campgrounds  Routt National Forest  Gore Mtn.

713,My father and I were elk hunting in October 2005 in the White River National Forest near the Flat Tops Wilderness.  This area is in Rio Blanco county outside of Buford  CO.  My father has hunted there most years since the 1970  s.  I have been a dozen or so times since the 80  s.  The area is along the [edited] at about 10 000 feet.  Very remote  few hunters.  We backpack in and camp in the primitive style.  Our site is [edited]. My father killed an elk and asked if I could meet him one morning to dress it and haul it down a steep slide.  The slide is an open area that extends up the side of a mountain about 1/2 mile.  It is steep and as a result has a central corridor that is devoid of trees.  It is surrounded on both sides by dense forest growth.  It is rocky and very rugged. I met him one morning at about 1030 am to help out.  When I arrived he told me he had heard a series of very loud knocks sometime before I arrived.  He said it was up the slide toward the rim and the flat tops area on the top of the mountain.  He said that they were very loud and sounded like a man hammering on a tree with a hammer.  He said that the knocks were so unusual  he thought I was up above him messing around with him.  I told him that I had not been  and then jokingly commented that bigfoots are   said to make sounds like that. Anyway  we started working on the elk and I was there about a 1/2 hour when we heard the knocks again.  This time  they were to our left (south)  at the same elevation on the moutain we were on.  They came from dense growth and seemed to be no further than 100 yards away.  There were 8-10 knocks  very rythmic  and quite loud.  They were strange and obviously not made by anything we could identify (unless it was a 200 pound woodpecker).  They sounded like a rock hit against wood -- very clear and crisp.  No other unusual sounds.  We have had a couple other unusual occurances and perhaps I will submit them.  At any rate  I checked your site and to my suprise  found that the knocks on your  Whoops and Knocks  sound bite are hauntingly similar.

714,At the time I was a resident of Steamboat Springs  Colorado. Each elk season we would put up an elk camp about 15 miles (horseback only) northwest of Strawberry Park in the MT Zirkel wilderness area. On the opening morning we were kept in camp by a rather heavy wet snow that did not stop until around 10 AM at which time the sun came out and we saddled up our horses to take a quick look for elk tracks  intending to return to camp for a quick lunch.  On my return to camp I cut a set of tracks that looked like a big barefoot person had passed by. The tracks were about 12 to 13 inches long with only four toes that I could see and a broad arch and heel area. I returned to camp and brought the camp cook back to look at them since they crossed the creek only about 100 yards from our tents. I decided to follow the tracks and found where the creature had stood on the other side of the creek milling about as if trying to decide where to go. The tracks led uphill through the black timber  which I followed for about half an hour.  The tracks had begun to interest my horse a great deal.  He kept sniffing the tracks and became more and more skittish until  in an area of several big blow-downs  he refused to go any further and began to show signs of panic which of course was transmitted to me.  I took a hard left into a big avalanche area which I followed for about 300 or 400 yards.  The black timber which I had just left began to turn into Aspens so I cut back hoping to reacquire the track. Whatever it was was still in the black timber (Spruce trees) and I didn  t have much heart to go in and look.  End of story. I am an experienced woodsman  have spent lots of time in the high country on horseback  had a pack of Plott hounds for bear hunting  and have never encountered any tracks like these.  And the horse in question I had was a great mountain horse  was not gun shy or spooky in any way.  His skittish behavoir and was the biggest reason I gave up the hunt on the tracks. He lived to be 40 years old and was with me from the time he was 9 months old. , ,Routt,5,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8107,no
715,1.) October 1996 after the second or third snow of the season. 2.) July 1997. 1.) Huge footprints with a couple inches of snow over them. But the stride was masive and could not be duplicated by myself  and was not elk or dear tracks. 2.) Loud crashing noise as if someone was mad at my presence. Sounding like something had broke a large branch in half. And then when I turned in the direction of the noise there was silence. As if some thing was now hiding. An animal such as an elk would be on the move. But what ever had made the noise was now  what seemed to be  hiding from my sight. It seems like there would be more in this area because of the size of the surrounding forest lands. I would love to hear more from this area. ,1.)

716,My girlfriend (now wife) and I were snowshoing in the mountains above fish creek falls outside of steamboat springs  CO in the winter.  We were off trail and decided to attempt to shortcut down the mountain to get back to the trail head.  We miscalculated and found ourselves in a very steep ravine just above fish creek and we were trying to find a way back up the steep incline as it was nearly humanly impossible to scale the side of the canyon.  Ahead in the snow we saw a set of tracks heading straight up the side of the ravine.  Initially we though it must be an elk or deer  but looking at the spacing of the tracks they appeared to be created by a bi-pedal creature with a gate much larger than I could span (I am a little over 6 foot tall)  The tracks appeared to have the basic shape of a human foot and toe impressions could be faintly seen in a couple of the tracks.  The tracks were postholed - 16 - 24 inches deep and most impressive was how this creature powered it  s way through this deep snow up a slope that was over a 45 degree angle.  A deer or elk would have left long dragging skids through snow this deep  but there was no dragging  just deep  large  single steps that would look just like a humans gait  except maybe a foot more between each step.  We pondered it at length and I have a couple of digital photos  although honestly not much showed up with the whiteout action of the snow.  I spend a lot of time outdoors and I have seen countless elk  deer  and bear tracks.  This was none of thsoe for certain.  A friend of mine who is active in your organization told me I should post this despite the lack of credible proof  so here it is! I can provide the actual month and date when I dig up the digital photos... ,Take the fish creek falls main trail across the bridge (passing the falls) and continue up the trail about 1/2 mile until you are past the switchbacks and the trail straightens heading WSW.  Take a right off the trail go a few hundred feet and then turn ENE and follow back down the ravine towards fish creek.  Decend towards the creek until your about 150 feet above the water and then follow the creek back towards the bridge and falls (heading approx wnw) and you will pass over roughly the same area we did.  I estimate that we were about 1500 feet from the falls (heading towards them) when we saw the tracks. ,Routt,5,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8107,yes
717,We were hunting third split rifle in section 26 of Flat tops in 2005. I had not seen many Elk in area this year. I hunted an area I had seen Elk before in the early morning by myself and saw nothing. My brother Greg got up late and went to same area. He said in open grassy area on side of hill was a large group of Elk in plain sight. Greg took a shot at about 200 yards from a fence. He shot at a large bull in group. He thought he was successful  but nothing dropped. He walked accross Derby creek down a big canyon chasing them  but to no avail. He came back and got me from camp excitedly after looking all afternoon. I have confidence in my brother shooting  so I said lets go back and look some more. After  we got back  we went to side of the open hill and found two separate blood trails. Not one  but two  which is strange. You could smell what I thought was Elk heavy still in area  so I thought. I followed blood trail down the ravine towards Derby creek. As I got about 1/3 down on Elk run at a very steep angle the huge bull Elk from the group came running crazed up the trail and was on me in no time. It about run me over and I jumped to get out of the way and I fell down. Then after I got my wits back from nearly being gored. A bout 30 seconds later we heard the loudest angry howl or growl I have ever heard come from the hill below me from the heavy woods. It made my hair stand on end. Everyone heard it  it was a 100 times louder than an Elk bugle and sounded like an angry animal or human of some kind as it echoed through the ravine. It really was something. In fact  it was the most awesome sound I have ever heard in my life. It spooked the horses from our other hunters and the guides horses as well as the hunters. In my mind  we may ruined a another hunters hunt. This is why the second blood trail  and the foul smell and the angry yell. I will never forget that day and my brother and I speak of it often. ,The area is the Derby Creek drainage system near Stump park. ,Routt,5,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8107,yes
718,We had already unpacked our backpacks and were just going up to the top of the mountain to see were my husband could go elk hunting. As we were looking around  we seen this big black bear looking creature. We knew it wasn  t a bear  because both my husband and myself are black bear hunters. This creature was about 200 yards away on a open spot on the mountain. It was running away from us at a pretty good pace we figured around 20mph. From were we were standing the creature seemed to be just gliding along at a fast pace. My 13 year old nephew looked at my husband and myself and said   Boy I never seen a bear running on it  s hind legs before  and running that fast.  My husband is not a firm believer in the unknown but I swear to what I saw was no kind of black bear or animal that I ever saw before. We figured it was around 8 feet tall. ,My husband myself and my son and nephew were backpacking in the San Juan Mountains in Colorado the days of July 25th and 26th of this year 1998.

719,In about late June of 2008 I was hiking the crater Lake trail outside of Durango Colorado with 3 of my children. They had run a little ways ahead of me and I was just admiring the view when off in the tree line about half way up the trail I noticed a large hairy figure approx. 7 to 9 feet tall walking just behind the tree line at about 50 to 100 yards. It was walking upright and took long strides. I only saw it for a minute maybe and didnt say anything to the kids so not to alarm them. I never really told too many people about this but after watching a bigfoot special on tv about a year later I realized I wasnt the only one to ever see something like that in this area. ,Up 550 past Durango in the San Juan mountains.

720,This story is a story that my mom told me.  She says it happened when she was young  back in the late 60s  maybe early 70s  I would guess.  I will confirm this with her. My family used to have a cabin near and North of Dillon  Colorado off of Highway 9.  There is a  Blue River Campground  there.  The private road we would take to the cabin is directly across Hwy 9 from the entrance to this campground.  My uncle and aunt  20 years older than my mom  bought this cabin back in the 60s  they had it until around 1990  when I was 10  so I have been to the locations described in this report.  My mom was in her teens when this happened.  I am not  however  familiar with how the land is currently being used  as I have not been there since the cabin was sold.  I doubt the cabin is even there anymore  it did not have electric or water service.  Only a Propane stove with about a 60 gallon propane drum and an outhouse.  Rural extremist-cabins have taken hold in the area surrounding Dillon  CO since the early 90s and many large-scale cabins have been erected in that area  so I don  t know if that area is still private or not. This road led into a privately owned cattle ranch  there was a gate we needed to open & close as we went through  so traffic and any other people were very infrequent when I was a kid.  It was probably even more so at the time of the incident my mother has told me about. Once at the cabin  you could head up an old logging-road turned to trail  up the mountain kind of following the runoff creek & find a beaver dam/pond about 3/4 to 1 mile up the trail.  We would fish here & catch many little rainbow trout.  Farther up the trail/mountain was another beaver pond  I would guess maybe an additional 1/2-1 mile up the trail. When I was 10 and under  I would often walk and explore these woods alone.  I always thought this story my mom told me was just to scare me into staying close to the cabin.  I would often wander But  now  we no longer own the cabin and I am 26; she claims this story was always true. The technical owners of this cabin  my aunt and uncle had a son  my cousin  that was very close to my mom  s age.  They would spend a lot of time at the cabin in his and my mom  s younger years with the family.  My cousin had a small dirt bike  that he and my mom would ride tandem on through the forest there. She said when they were young  they had taken a ride up the trail together on the dirt bike  my cousin driving and my mom riding on the seat behind him.  She said it was a tight fit  and she would almost fall off.  They passed the first beaver pond and continued up the trail to the 2nd.  When you approach the 2nd beaver pond  the trail rises up this hill and the beaver pond is located kind of on a plateau of land.  So  you come up over the burm from the trail and reach the plateau where you can see the entire beaver pond  it was only about 50-75 feet across  and the edge of the pond was surrounded by a fairly good amount of open land  when I would go there  I remember about 10-30 feet of grass between the pond and the trees.  It seems the beavers built the pond in what was a creek going through a meadow and it filled up most of the meadow. She said as they approached the burm leading up to the plateau  my cousin saw it first.  He whipped the dirt bike around to head back down the hill  saying some explitives about what he just saw.  My mom  being in the back did not see it until the bike spun around and she slid off the back onto her feet.  There was a large  very large  white creature squatting down on the edge of the pond  with its knees on either side of its body  reaching down into the water.  It was covered in 5-7  white furr.  Its body was bulky and muscular.  Obviously not a bear  as only black bears and the rare grizzly bear are located in this area.  There are no creatures covered fully in white furr.  My family  being a  redneck-type  of family  are full of hunters  campers and hikers.  We all know what a white-tailed deer  Elk  Bears  Mountain Lion  Porkupine  Bobcats  etc...look like.  She said this thing must have weighed at least 700-800 lbs.  Because it was squatting down  height could not be estimated accurately. By the time my mom saw it  my cousin was already beginning to go as quickly as he could back down the trail.  She took a quick couple of seconds glance at this creature.  I need to verify if she noticed it react in any way and how far away from it they were when they saw it.  They headed quickly down the trail terrified as she tried to stay on the seat  but mostly slid off and was halfway riding and running behind the dirt bike trying to keep up. As a kid  I was told many stories of these mostly aspen covered woods.  Most were just campfire tales to scare us  but this one was for real.  Even 20-30 years later as I was a boy exploring those woods...after I heard this story  I never went farther than the first beaver pond because I was always creeped out because of this tale.  From time to time  I remember feeling like something was watching me.  Not always  but sometimes.  Thinking back on it now  I think I must have been crazy to wander around those woods alone being under 10 years old.  I read this site and the reports in the 60  s & 70  s in Colorado.  I saw other posts of reports of a creature with white fur.  This prompted me to post this story my mom told me.  Perhaps it was still in those woods when I was a boy  or perhaps its relatives or offspring.  Perhaps one of these things are what I felt watching me from time to time. ,Provided in story. ,Summit,22,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8117,yes
721,I lived in Colorado for 29 years. Eighteen of those I spent working at ski resorts. Over the years I  ve seen hundreds of deer and elk as well as dozens of bear  everything from cubs to large 400 pound males. In the last 4 years I  ve had 3 separate sightings of 4 creatures that I hesitate to identify. The first happened in the fall of 1998 off the highway between Copper Mountain and Leadville. As I was driving towards Leadville  I saw what I at first thought was a large tree stump that someone had carved like a totem pole. It was about 100 feet to my left on the valley floor. While I was marveling at the detail of the carving the  totem pole  rotated from the waist up and looked at me. I slammed on my brakes and skidded to a stop on the shoulder. When the dust cleared the creature was gone. I turned the car around but no luck. What I saw was hairy from head to toe  very thick with broad shoulders and lacked the long snout and round rump that bears have. , ,Summit,22,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8117,yes
722,My husband and I were camping in the Eagle Nest Wilderness CO early June 2013.  While hiking on the trail we had encountered a larger then normal amount of snow due to the late snow storms.  We were a few miles up the trail from Surprise Lake when we heard a low growl.  We thought this must be a mountain lion and due to the snow and inability to travel quickly we double backed to surprise lake and set up camp for the night.  While sitting at the lakeside I saw a large  brownish red animal across the lake.  The animal was large and appeared to be walking upright.  My rational mind said its just a deer or another large animal that lives in the wilderness and disregarded what I thought I saw.  Later that evening around dusk my husband and I were sitting in the tent when we heard what sounded like a knock against a tree.  We looked out the tent door and didn  t see anything.  Again I assumed this must have been a woodpecker  another animal  or a hiker.  We continued talking and heard the knock again  it was a three knock pattern  along with something that sounded like a rock against a tree.  We got out of the tent and looked around.  I told my husband it sounded like a rock thrown against a tree and said let me show you what it sounds like.  I picked up a hard sound rock and threw it against the tree.  Immediately a similar sound came back.  I assumed it was an echo and I did it again.  Again a similar sound came back.  My husband then asked if I saw something moving up the hillside and explained where he saw movement.  A large  brownish red animal was peeking out from behind the tree.  The animal was swaying back and forth from behind the tree.  The animal appeared to be squatted down swaying/peeking out from behind the tree.  It had a large head with a large brow line  large shoulder  and nose.  The nose and upper lip appeared to be a lighter color than rest of the animal seen.  We took our sport camera and tried to take pictures of the animal but it was about 40 feet up a hillside.  (We have a blurry picture but it appears to have a large animal head in the picture.)    As we watched the animal sway back and forth we heard a large knock behind us to the left  towards the lake  then heard a knock up towards the animal we saw then back behind us.  The feeling was very odd and made us feel very uncomfortable.  My husband wanted to hike out but due to the late evening I suggested we stay and hike out first thing in the morning.  We carry a large knife  bear spray  and a gun with us so I felt somewhat safe.  It was a very restless night and first daylight we packed our bags and left.  After hiking out and getting in the car to drive off we discussed what we witnessed and both could not explain what we saw.  This has taught me not to throw rocks against trees! I would be willing to send the pictures we took.  Two are extremely blurry due to my hand shaking  my husband took two other pictures  one you can see the head if you zoom up and the other it appears it moved. ,Campsite at Surprise Lake in the Eagle Nest Wilderness.

723,On Thursday July 25 my girlfriend and I we hiking in Mayflower Basin south of Co 91. We were up in the basin and Helen had gone ahead to the foot of the basin. I was about 100 yds off the three miner log cabin remnants sitting on a rock enjoying peanuts and water when  looking west  I saw a very large brown biped approach the snow wall / cornice and seek to climb it. The biped was unable to climb up over 20 feet  moved back down laterally to its right  and then down to the ground off the snow. It then walked on two legs very briskly to the right  subsequently out of my view. About 4-5 minutes later a hiker with his dog came walking down the trail. And I later saw this brown biped from time to time walking above the snow cornice southbound. Did not see it again. Helen returned to me  we discussed  then walked down to the locked gated prohibiting cars into the basin to talk with the hiker. His name was Robbie  his dog  Dallas. We agreed to scale up the trail to where I had seen the brown biped. Helen took longer  but Robbie and I reached the area  found hand prints in the snow in an arch  one print lower with three big fingers and one thumb. Foot prints were not descriptive of toes  arch heel.  We took Iphone photos and will share if interested. We then traversed to right  north  on difficult terrain. That is quite slanted where the biped moved quickly and easily. No further sighting. This was now about 2 30 pm when Inhad seen the biped about 1 45 pm. Returned back to dirt road and the parking lot by bushwacking through forest. ,Stop at paved parking lot off Co 91 to enter dirt road up to Mayflower Gulch. Head south up road.

724,We camped in the mountains a lot on the weekends as I was growing up. My dad liked to rough it compared to most. Sleep under the stars or in an old military tent and take only a few pots and a couple of fishing poles was pretty much all luxury we had except for two trips. I don  t remember the circumstances of this particular trip but it was one of only two camping trips we took on the East Slope and one of the only two times I didn  t sleep in a tent or under the stars. The first trip was over by Red Feathers Lakes where they were draining the ponds and bears were thicker than gnats so my dad had me and my sister sleep in his friend  s popup camper. The second trip was the on west side of Pike  s Peak where we went camping with some of my dad  s friends. My sister and I were young definitely preteen or younger. My dad  s friends had gotten there before us maybe even the night before and had camp all set up by the time we had arrived. I remember marveling at the camp set up because they had a  big  camper trailer that slept 6 or 8 and a table to cook on. I donâ€™t know if this was in a structured camping area or some backcountry area. But I donâ€™t recall any other campsite in close proximity. I don  t remember much of the details except my sister and I were repeatedly told to stay real close to camp (this was somewhat unusual) and the adults were talking about something but would stop talking about it when they thought us girls could hear them (not unusual at all). Anyway  the evening ended pretty early for a camping trip (after 11 00 but before midnight) and everyone ended up sleeping in the camper trailer. My sister and I were in the bed in the front and on top of the full size bed where I think my dad  s friends slept. My dad and his girlfriend slept in the dinning area where the table converted into a sleeping area. I slept by the front window so my sister could get to the bathroom easier. Beside me was a long window (at least 3   long and 6  tall) that had these little curtains hanging from them. Sometime during the night I woke up and I could hear very heavy breathing. It took me some time to figure out what I was hearing but to this day I do not believe it was coming from inside the trailer. I could easily distinguish my sister  s heavy breathing  my dad  s loud snoring  his friendsâ€™ snoring  and my dad  s girlfriend  s deep breathing. While trying to figure out whose snoring was whose I remember hearing a  chatter  but I couldn  t understand it. There wasn  t much chatter but it was close  right down by my feet. Then the heavy breathing was next to the window. I donâ€™t know if there were more than one of these things breathing heavily by the window but I could hear the breathing down by one end of the window by my feet  and then closer by my head. I do remember the tone and volume of the breathing sounding very much same at both ends   as if something was moving from one end of the window to the other. I remember listening very intently to this trying to figure out how many and thinking that whatever it was would have to hop over the trailer hitch to get from one end of the window to the other. By this time the heavy breathing and â€œchatterâ€ had been going on for several minutes and I was frozen with fear  the hair on my arms standing on end and unable to utter a word. I remember trying to call my dad but no sound came out. I remember just praying that my dad would hear it too  wake up and the sounds would end. I tried pulling on my sisterâ€™s leg so sheâ€™d wake up and it would go away but she always could sleep through a hurricane much less her little sister bothering her sleep. After sometime of listening to the breathing move right outside the window I worked up enough courage to take a peek out the window.  I took a corner of the curtain and pulled it back enough for me to see a few inches out the window. There was a light on somewhere outside  enough for me to see more than just darkness. I was expecting or hoping to see nothing outside  but I saw a pair of brown eyes just inches from my face staring right back at me. I quickly pushed the curtain closed and laid there completely paralyzed with fear. I donâ€™t remember much more except the breathing stopped shortly after that and I must have somehow fallen back to sleep before first light. I do remember the next morning my sister complaining that I had wet the bed and the adults saying that â€œwhatever it was took all of the apples and potatoesâ€ out of the back of the truck. I do remember some details of what I saw staring at me. It was right next to  almost touching the window like it was peering in to see. I saw something from just above where oneâ€™s eyebrows would be to somewhere in the middle of its nose. I donâ€™t recall seeing the end of its nose or even the nostrils or the sides of its face. Its skin was dark brown or black and was the same shade around the eyes  nose and lower forehead. I donâ€™t recall seeing any hair or fur. Its nasal ridge was not pronounced like a humanâ€™s or a bearâ€™s  in fact I canâ€™t recall seeing much of one. I do remember an eyebrow ridge but I donâ€™t recall how pronounced it was. Its eyes were set somewhat back from the eyebrow ridge and where ones check bones would be. To describe the eyes without being too anthropomorphic - the eyes did not have a cold or lifeless appearance but rather a stunned but processing appearance. , ,Teller,9,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8119,yes
725,My uncle was working the graveyard shift for a mine overlooking Cripple Creek. He was out on his nightly rounds checking the ponds to make sure everything was still running the way it was supposed to. Some of the places he had to check are rather secluded. He finished checking one of the buildings where the equipment to keep the ponds up and running. He locked the building up and went around the side of the building to get in the truck  when he saw the creature. My uncle stands 6  5  and he weighed a good 220 at the time. He ran back to the bldg. unlocked the door  and used the emergency phones that they had in the bldg. ( I was 13 at that time  and I had never seen or heard my uncle cry. I am 29 now and I have never seen or heard him cry since that time.) First  he called my grandfather and asked him to come and bring the gun  crying the whole time. We lived 40 miles away from where he was calling from (near Guffey). My mother and grandfather also worked for the mine so they knew right where to go. My grandmother stayed on the phone with my uncle to try and keep him calm. He just kept repeating  It wasn  t a bear  Oh my god it was huge is pa coming?  He spoke to my mother and grandfather about it. My grandfather said he was on drugs so he didn  t speak about it very much after that. I am very close to my uncle as is my mother we are the only ones he ever spoke to about it again. At the time he was 22 and afraid of nothing. Growing up where we did we knew what a bear looked like as well as all the other wildlife in the area. EXCEPT for the thing he saw that night. When he spoke of it he said it was on two legs and taller than any animal he had ever seen. I tried to get him to send this to you  but he doesn  t like to talk about it. He starts shaking every time he does. ,Cripple Creek  Colorado; Teller County off of Hwy 67 North of Cripple Creek ,Teller,9,Colorado ,CO,Unknown ,8119,yes
726,The following was told to me by a close friend  in a most serious manner   I have no reason to doubt him. It was October 1986  near the Cripple Creek water shed.  At first light my friend  his father  and his cousin had crested a hill in 2 pickups. There was about 6  of new fallen snow on the ground.  On the hillside in front of them (about 200 yards)  they noticed a fresh set of tracks  large and easy to distinguish in the new snow. The tracks left a heavy wooded area  went down the hill (open area)  looped around and went back up to the forest.(my friend drew a omega type symbol in the air). My friend remembers telling his father   what kind of idiot would be walking around up here and would walk that way around the hillside.   His cousin took his binoculars and studied the area for some time looking for elk.  He squinted his eyes and leaned forward to concentrate on something he saw.  My friend asked him several times what he saw  but got no awnser.  He said his cousin turned as white as a sheet and put down the binoculars.  He asked him again    what do you see?   He cousin seemed very up- set and said    I  m not gonna tell you  I know  you  ll just make fun of me.  After more prodding he said    I think I just saw bigfoot . They did not go and investigate the area further  or go see the tracks upclose.  They avoided the area all together.  I dont have permission to use any names so I cant give any here  but maybe in the future I will talk to my friends cousin and get more details. I did show my friend this web site  and he asked me to print out some sightings in the same area to show his cousin. ,Teller county  Colorado  near Cripple Creek  around the Cripple Creek watershed. ,Teller,9,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8119,yes
727,I was on travel for my job and staying at Colorado Springs for several weeks. It was the middle of September  on a Saturday morning. The day before it had rained hard  then that night it cleared off and got down near freezing. I got up early that Saturday and decided to go exploring. I drove over to the Florissant Fossil Beds. It is a pretty isolated area. It was early in the morning about 8 00 and I was the first visitor to the site. I got there right when the park ranger opened the gate. Just he and I were the only ones there. The ranger told me that I should go on the nature trail through the park. It was a self guided tour. The trail is a dirt trail. I got probably 3/4 of a mile and the path got soft. The rain the day before had washed the mud on the path smooth. I noticed at that time that a herd of elk had come on to the path from the right  some time that night after it rained and followed the path for approximately 50 feet. They then exited into the forest on the left. I got to looking at the track closer and noticed that on top of the elk track were a set of large 16  barefoot prints following the elk. I thought it was odd that somebody would be out walking around that night before barefooted and in the mud. I continued on the path and it looped back to the ranger station. I still was the only visitor when I arrived back there. I asked the ranger who would be out there barefooted in this temperature. He laughed and said bigfoot. ,At the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument ,Teller,9,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8119,no
728,My name is Jeff [D.] and I live in Colorado Springs  CO. I have been a big game guide for several years and I am in the process of opening my on outfit. I must admit I have always been skeptical about bigfoot until now. Two years ago in 98 I was packing in clients into the Pike Natl forrest. Myself and another guide along with four clients were on our way out and got a late start. With only a few miles to go we were in total darkness along a trail. My horse stopped with out command and got very anxious. I assumed it was another animal or at worst a mountain lion. I eagrly tried to get him to move forward and he would not. I got off my horse and led him up the trail. Coming around a bend in the trail a creature standing at least 7 foot tall and covered in dark hair crossed the trail not twenty feet infront of me. It walked on two legs and was out of sight in two or three steps  but what amazed me was that it didn  t make any noise as it disappeared into the very steep valley below. Another thing I found disturbing was the faint smell in the air. I hunt and guide hunters for mostly elk and 9 times out of ten I will smell them before I see them. This was no elk  bear  or mountain lion. After the incident  I was careful to lead the horses to one side of the trail not to disturb any tracks. The next day after getting my clients to the airport I returned on foot and was shocked to find a track  I placed my foot beside it and it was at least another 8 to 10  past my boot. I wear a size 10. No one has ever spoken about the incident and no one will admit what they saw.I  ve tried several times to talk about it but know one will admit it.I have held this secret inside until now.Last year while hunting in the same area alone I had a close encounter and was able to observe in length of what I saw that night. I was hunting in a remote camp that is a 1/2 days pack in on foot. No one else hunts this country and I have never seen sign of people in the past. I had made camp at the bottom of a valley that held some remarkable bulls in it. There is a stream that runs through the valley and at the top  it is cut off by large cliffs that unless you are a professional rock climber is un passable. Through out the valley runs a series of beaver ponds and I was camped at the last one at the bottom. I arrived at the valley around 4 00 pm and set up my camp. I started a fire and prepared dinner. After a restless nights sleep  due to the anticipation of big bulls  I woke up at 3 00am and fixed breakfast  gathered my gear and was off by 4 30 or 5 00am. I hiked up the valley to a area I have always seen elk. This particular morning the wind was not coming down off the mountain instead it was swirling. I decided to sit on top of an out cropping and use the height to my advantage and try not to spook any animals. As the sun was coming up  I bugled several times looking for a response. I heard a bull elk respond in the same direction that I took coming up. I quickly started to glass the area in search of the bull. As I was working my way up the valley I heard the bull again. I went with my glasses to where I thought I had heard the bugle and when I glassed around the beaver pond that  s when I saw it. I saw a very dark object squatting beside the beaver pond. At first I hought it was a bull lying in the pond. The creature stood up and was looking around. When he looked at me or in my direction  I got the feeling he knew I was there  and a feeling of excitement and terror filled my body. The creature was again around 7 foot tall maybe taller but not much.And it had short dark brown almost a reddish coat. It had facial features of that of a human  with the exception of a human nose. It was smaller and looked as if it sat on his mouth.Another feature that stood out to me was the size of it  s hands. They were long and were like 1/2 the size of it  s forearm. For the first time ever I was truely scared. Not of what I saw but of not ever really seeing anything like this before and having to face a reality. After at least 5 minutes of observing the creature he turned and walked through the creek towards my camp. He then turned and walked up a ridge and stopped and watched my camp or at least in that direction. After he moved off I got down off my perch and ran to my camp. I packed my gear and have yet to go back in there. , ,Teller,9,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8119,yes
729,In November 2001  I was guiding for a husband and wife team and was also accompanied by my own wife during a elk hunt. That morning we had located a herd of elk in some remote country and had stalked to their location to find that it was only cows. Since we had bull tag only we did not pursue but instead went out on the point of a mountain to glass for any potential bulls. As our party was sitting and glassing I called periodically hoping for a response from a bull. To my surprise (all of our surprise) we heard a low guttural moan. At first I thought it to be a bull bedded down but the second time I realized that it was no bull at all and could not possibly be a bear. I immediately went toward the noise to confirm what ever had made it and found no animals  no elk  deer  bear  etc. Shortly after hearing and investigating the sound I moved the party up the mountain to a aspen grove where I knew mid-day bulls would visit to eat. Shortly after positioning the hunters my wife and I took a position higher up the mountain to get a better view and for calling. After sitting in the grove for less than an hour we heard logs being hit together. Not like two bulls fighting but more like someone taking a sizeable log and hitting against another. The end of the day came and we returned to the camp and the hunt was over. That night two inches of snow fell and I went back to the same location and found a dead cow elk with only her chest cavity being open and from what I could tell having most of her internal organs. I am of course no expert in zoology or cryptolgy [sic] but from my best guess and knowing what I have seen from the past I think that my hunting party and I disturbed a bigfoot while hunting that morning. I did find tracks but due to the sun melt the tracks were very large with no distinguishable marks. This took place only 8 to 10 miles from the previous sightings. ,It was off Gold Camp Rd.  two miles east of the watershed road. ,Teller,9,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8119,no
730,My family (5) and I go on vacation every year. One year we decided to go to Colorado on a camping trip. We also would always our dog and this year my brother took his rat.  After a long trip across Kansas  we finally crossed the border to Colorado. We headed to Colorado Springs. We were going to stay at a camping trip  but as usual we found a place to set up camp away from any sites or towns. It was pretty secluded where we were. Our camp site was surrounded by woods except to the east there was a long field. Now it was the very first night and we had two tents. In one tent was my Parents and my sister. In the other tent was my brother his pet rat and I. We ate a good meal of hot dogs and s  mores. A sitting around the fire for a little while  we went to bed. It was a very clear night and I remember how bright the moon and stars were. I really ever heard of  bigfoot  or paid to much attention to it before. It seemed like I hadn  t had much sleep before I awoke to find my brother  s rat digging around in the bag at the top of the little pup tent(my brother let the rat run around in the tent). Its rustling is what I think woke me up. So I got up to take him out  but I froze as did my blood. I was suddenly wide awake. I just stared because to the left of me I saw the silouette of a tall two legged creature through the door( we had zipped up the screen and left the cover off ).  I was and still am sure that it was not a bear or any other animal  and I am especially sure it was no human. Its arms were shorter than its legs and it was covered with hair. I got the feeling it was alarmed because right when stopped a jerked its head and walked speadlily away. My eyes were glued to it and I watched its every move. It walked away towards the field  turned around  and I lost sight of it. I can still remember thinking about the way it moved. It definatly was not normal. It bent at the knee and when it turned  it seemed like its whole upper body moved around. Of course the next day when I told my family no one believed me  but I know and I have known that it is a fact that sasquatch is real and is a living breathing animal. I also believe that it is not a threat. I definatly encourage people who are trying to bring sasquatch into reality for others for the right reasons. Ever since then I been very interested in it and cryptozoology. ,off the road from Woodland Park to Decker. ,Teller,9,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8119,yes
731,My wife and I took a drive to Skaguay reservoir near Victor Colorado. Nice day and there were people fishing along the lake. Crazy thing is it was 11am and this thing walked across a valley in full sight of lots of people. It was across the lake maybe half a mile  walking slow but was moving at a fast pace  its arm movements and stride looked normal to be going that fast. I asked my wife her thought and she said it looked big and moved real differently. There were people on the lake and on the far bank half way to the animal fishing  it appeared larger at a greater distance. When it left the valley it left a way or on a trail that no one would choose.

732,On approximately December of 1982  two friends and myself were returning to Colorado from Texas  by car. At just before midnight  on a dark stretch of Interstate 25  heading North towards Denver (just 100 some miles before Colorado Springs CO.) something strange caught my eye. I was seated in the passenger side of the car. A friend  Trent  was driving. In the backseat  asleep and extremely ill  was another friend. To the right  traveling at 60 MPH  the headlights caught what appeared to be a 3-4 foot  white haired ape-like creature  with a dark face. It was standing upright. My eyes caught it some 100 feet ahead in the lights  and I followed it with my eyes. It was merely standing there at the side of the road. Although I admit a childhood interest in BIGFOOT lore  I almost instantly dismissed it as such a creature. Surely my eyes were playing tricks on me. I said nothing to my friend  who was driving. My first instinct was to ask my friend to turn around and go back to investigate. Instead  I said nothing. Five minutes later  my friend pulled off to the side of the road  as he had to  relieve  himself. We met at the back of the car to  take care of business   where he expressed he was getting tired. I agreed  telling him  I  too  was tired  and was starting to  see things . He then told me  that he was also  seeing things   saying   Yeah  I just thought I saw a Polar Bear back there.  A chill went up my spine  and I asked him if it was  white and furry . He said yes. I told him that I thought I saw a  small white ape  with a dark face!  Without missing a beat  he told me to get in the car.  Let  s get out of here!  We wanted to go back to investigate  but our sick friend in the backseat needed to get home  due to his illness. He was passed out throughout the entire episode  and we didn  t want to pester him with our shared  illusion . We  re obviously unsure of what we saw. However  we agreed that it was not a coyote  and we both only saw two legs. This account was dismissed by us  until 5 years later  when  Unsolved Mysteries  did a feature on some unusual sightings of a large Bigfoot like creature. Their report  Along the Colorado Front range  there had been reports of a WHITE haired APE-LIKE CREATURE  roaming around the homes in the foothills just NORTH of Colorado Springs. (Our sighting was 100 some mile SOUTH). I think it important to mention  for credibility  that I have held a strong fascination in Bigfoot lore since childhood. I am not totally convinced that what I saw was what I know as a Bigfoot. The account is true  however  I believe the circumstances of the event and the accounts in that region are interesting and worth reporting here. I have never told of this event to more than a half-dozen people. I think it important to mention  for credibility  that I have held a strong fascination in Bigfoot lore since childhood.

733,Creature was near a pond  initially bent over he caught sight of us after about 45 seconds of us observing him from about a 45 degree angle looking down and back about 100-150 feet. At first we thought it was a bear  but when he stood up erect and looked at us we knew it was not a bear. I don  t think I have ever felt fear like that day. It has been 28 years and I still remember it like it was yesterday. I was a student at the University of Denver at the time and we told everyone at school about the incident.

734,This incident was a scream we heard on the opening day of archery dear and elk season in Western Colorado.  My hunting partner and I had left our camp before dawn to make the final climb into Fall Creek basin from just below the mouth of the basin (approximately 300 yards)  After hunting the basin we exited out the mouth of the basin and instead of returning to our camp we headed north to the next basin over  Thistledown Creek.  From the dark timber near our camp  we were now approximately 500 yards away and a couple hundred feet higher in elevation.  An extemely loud blood curdling scream lasting several seconds boomed out from the direction of our camp.  There clearly was nothing between our position and the dark timber where our camp was located. Yet the scream was unbelievably loud.  It happened just once.  After gaining control of our senses  we concluded it must have been a mountain lion. I talked to a few hunting guides I know who specialize in hunting mountain lions.  None of them could verify the sound of the scream I described as being from a mountain lion.  I did not consider it to be a Bigfoot until I heard a recording of what was thought to be a Bigfoot on a cable TV special aired this summer in July.  Since then  I have pondered that scream I heard in 1996.  Then my brother told me about this website. ,The incident occurred in Fall Creek Basin  on Hayden Mountain  above Camp Bird mine.

735,Witness  38  who requested confidentiality  was a young teen in junior high school at time of the incident. Witness  who will be called Jeff  said he and his friend were alone at his parents house one night when the friend  since deceased   noticed  something  looking into the house through the front door. Since the friend was  always a kidder   Jeff just looked outside to call his friend  s bluff.  But sure enough  there was this head looking at us.     He said since it was dark  few details were visible  but he described it as  like a coconut.      We freaked out  so we ran into mom  s bedroom and grabbed the .22 and loaded it with bullets. I told (the friend) to go lock the door  but he said no way. So we ran into the bedroom  which at the time didn  t have curtains. Soon we heard it breathing and kind of scratching at the window and we saw a hand up against the screen. I would say it had to be 8 to 10 feet tall to be looking in like that.     Witness stated at that time  he could see the animal looking in the window. He described it as  large  hairy and black.      My friend fired two shots at it  but missed. It took off running and we didn  t see it after that.     The two called the sheriff  who came to investigate and found the two bullet holes in the window  but no blood and no footprints on the hard adobe ground. The sheriff asked if the two had been drinking  but both were aspiring wrestlers. Jeff said neither of them drank nor used drugs.

736,We pulled into camp on a rainy night about midnight. Cows were in the camp  so as they were leaving we heard - at least what I told my nephews - a bull really upset with us. It was a throaty  gutteral huffing noise. Only the pitch never varied to a higher one at the end  like a bull bellowing. Only the so-called bull never left with the herd. That  and I never recalled seeing a bull in the herd. Then  after 15 or 20 min. of the huffing in front of us  it got quiet.  Then my Sister heard a noise behind her in the woods  that sounded like an angry growl. I told her it was only the dogs growling at something. She informed me both my dogs were right there with her  and it wasn  t them. So  she pulled out a pistol and turned and faced the direction it came from  and I went to get my rifle  and slung it across my back. Then  it got quiet and we didn  t hear anymore of that during the night. Whatever it was knew what a gun was. My dogs never barked or went to investigate anything. They stayed right with us. They are watch dogs at my home  and have been camping numerous times. They seemed to want our protection this time. The next night  we heard some stirring out in the woods  became real uneasy because everything went dead silent. So  we went hastily to bed in the camper  dogs and all  and locked down. During the night  my Sister said she had been looking at the sky  and stars  and when she looked back again  she said all she could see was like a  black mat  over the window. She and her boys said they heard the dogs growling low  and the boys said they saw  something black . The next night we broke camp about an hour before dark  and once more everything became deathly quiet again  and the feeling like we were being watched. We finished loading about dark  and as we started to leave  it came a downpour  so I was coming down off the mountain about 5 to 10 mph. At one point my Sister commented about one  bushy pine tree  in a grove of aspen trees  when the headlights flashed. About halfway down a vehicle caught up with us  and informed me the doors were open on my trailer. We stopped to close them  and my lock was broken. When we got into town  we stopped at a gas station  and there I noticed handprints and muddy smears on the camper. They we too big and too high for any of us to reach. One of the handprints was very clearly one of a primate. That is where I noticed the lock had been twisted until it broke  instead of just popping off  like I thought at first. Obviously  we were going slow enough for it to follow us  and check out our trailer. We had just built the camper on the trailer  and it was a nice shiny sheet-metal one.  The door is on the rear of the trailer ,In the Jersey Jim Lookout tower area. ,Montezuma,3,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8083,no
737,I saw what appeared to be a person walking near the edge of the deep canyon of the Yampa River (crawling  climbing  scrabbling might be more appropriate) The terrain is very rugged and the proximity to the cliff edge makes it dangerous--the rock is very weathered. I had made my way toward a rock promontory which lay NE of my camp which lay north of the old Mantle Ranch road. I was greatly surprised in that in all the many years that I had been in this area I had never before seen anyone else--the closest being rafters far down on the Yampa River or an occasional vehicle on the old ranch road. This is a remote and extremely hot arid region and people casually hiking in is not common. What I first thought to be a person was coming toward me along the edge of the cliff from the direction of the promontory and was about 100 feet away. I didn  t get a long look because it saw me too and fell back into the thick juniper and pinon but I saw it clearly enough to realize it was no hiker. It made a lot of noise at first--scrambling to get away I suppose. It appeared to be man-like and covered with dark  reddish brown hair. I would estimate its height to be maybe 6 foot. I did not really get a good look at its face but it gave me the impression of being ape-like. ,Dinosaur National Monument ,Moffat,3,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8081,yes
738,A friend and I were hunting on the Grand Mesa on the Lands End side.  We had hiked down Kanna Creek Trail to look for game. We had spent most of the day on stand and hiking.  We made our way back to my truck. We decided to stay the night so we could hunt in the AM and then go home. We were getting things set up for camp. Building a fire getting food out to cook. I had a Pop-up camper and I had just got it up and situated when my friend said  What the heck is that sound!? . He had never spent much time in the woods as I had so he was freeked out instantly. I came out of the camper to see what the problem was.  Then I heard it. It is the hardest thing to explain how it sounds but  here it goes. It sounded like a scream. Deep in sound  very loud and it lasted for long periods of time with the sound going up and down in volume.  It also sounded angry for some reason. At first I didn  t give it much thought. I had heard a Mountain Lion screem and that will make hair stand up on the back of your neck. I have also head bears. But bears do not do that sort of thing.  They are quiet most of the time. As this sound is going on and on and on pausing for short moments as if to catch its breath  my friend is realy freeked out by now. I said to him it is just a Lion or two lions or a lion and a bear fighting across the lake. This did not calm him down much. I had my sidearm on me still. So I pulled it out and shot off a round in the air during the screeming.  Silence.  See I told him  we scared it away. I started to go about getting food out so we could eat. Now it is a little darker and you can  t quite see details across the lake but you can still see. not even a minute later after firing a round off in the air  the sreeming started again. This time closer but still across the lake  louder and it seemed more pissed off! As if it was very mad we were here. Now we could here like bush being raked or shook but we could not see it. Just hear it. Now  I am getting freeked out because of what just happened. It came closer! Now  you would think a gun shot would scare game away not bring them closer. My friend is now really freeked out and wants to leave. NOW! I tell him  We have highpowered rifles and we will be safe . The whole time we are talking about leaving  the screeming is going on. I gave in to him wanting to leave and started to pack up camp. This took some time for us to do. Maybe 5 minutes or so. During this time the screeming was going on the whole time. Got everything loaded in a hurry buttoned up the camper and we got in and started it up and left. It is now dark and headlights the only lights besides the stars. The drive up and out of the lake has a few switch backs. I stopped at one to see if the screeming was still going on. It was not. We then drove out of there and down the mountain not saying a word. We had stopped to get a bite to eat and we just felt unsure of what we had experienced. Both of us decided not to say anything to anyone. I know I didn  t say anything to anyone about it for a long time. I am unsure if my friend has said anything to any one. I have watched shows on TV about BIGFOOT since. Some of the shows had taped sound of what they said was BIGFOOT. To me it sounded like what I had heard. ,At Carson Lake.

739,I lived in Las Animas county  Colorado  with my mother and step-father in a canyon called San Miguel which is located along the Raton Range on the Colorado/New Mexico border.  We lived in a very remote area.  (Behind Fisher  s Peak near Trinidad  CO)  I used to have to get up real early to get to school.  It was daybreak and our dog was outside barking hysterically.  I had never heard her growl or act this way before or after this morning.  She was looking into the canyon.  I went to our kitchen window which faced the canyon.  I could see something running into the canyon.  It was on two legs  tall and covered in hair.  It didn  t run like a man  it ran as if it was straddling a small rut  side to side.  I ran down the hall to my parents room to wake them up so they could see what I was seeing.  When they got to the window it was gone; however  I saw it one last time as it passed between bushes. , ,Las Animas,1,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8071,yes
740,In 1971 I saw some very large footprints in the snow in the summer high in a Colorado wilderness area. These prints were at least half again as big as a big human foot and the stride length was much longer than any human -- at least 4 feet or longer. They looked exactly like human prints. They were not bear  I recognize those. They proceeded across several small remaining snow patches on a mountain side meadow. There were about a dozen or more clear prints. I saw none on the ground between the snow  the ground was firm and damp. I saw no other suggestive evidence  but was not searching for any. I was scared shitless and wanted to get out of there ASAP! I wondered if they may have been human  and had enlarged and spread out by the heating  melting  cooling and refreezing that occurs at that time of year in the little snow patches. But the detail was fairly preserved and one would think that any melting and refreezing would blur those details. The possibility of this phenomenon should be examined. Someone should walk through the summer snow patches barefooted and then observe the prints for a number of days during the summer when this melt/refreeze procees occurs. If the enlarging of the prints and spreading of the stride does not occur  I assume these prints I saw were not human. If they do spread out  maybe someone just walked through there barefooted. I wondered if it were a hoax  but the area was quite remote and the perpetrator would have to know someone would pass that exact spot. I don  t recall if we were on an established trail or just wandering near our campsite. Also if it was a hoax  why would they put the prints in the snow  since one could not predict exactly when it would melt in the unpredictable summer weather. I have no particular interest in the existence of the Sasquatch  but as a scientist I am curious. Having seen these prints with my own eyes  I definitely believe it is possible. There were two friends were with me and we all saw the same thing. I am 46 years old and was in high school at that time. ,In the Rawah Wilderness  close to Steamboat  in the Roosevelt National Forest ,Larimer,8,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8069,yes
741,My name is Leona H.  My son  his wife  a friend  and I saw a Sasquatch on August 10th or 11th ? (on a Sunday) of l990  11 00 am  on a bright  sunny day   in Larimer County  Roosevelt National Forest  about twenty-five miles northwest of Ft. Collins.  I suppose the nearest Hwy would be Hwy 34 that goes through Loveland (about 20 miles away).  We had bought a small piece of property and were building a bridge across Buckhorn Creek.  We took a break and my son  Dallas C  was scanning a mountain to the west of us with his binoculars when he saw it.  My daughter-in-law grabbed the binoculars and looked  and she said    It  s chasing some deer   then   My God  Mom  it  s got knees!   She said it ran into a group of pine trees.  I got my binoculars and we stood quietly and waited.  Several minutes later it leaped out from the trees and went running across the face of the mountain.  I swear  that thing could run like the wind  and this was rugged terrain  but it had a very strange  destinctive gait.  The friend that was with us saw it without binoculars.  I guarantee you it was not a fake.  There is absolutely no possibility that it could have been.  No human could run that fast   especially across that rugged mountain  and it was at least seven feet tall.  What is puzzling is that it didn  t seem to fit with things I have read about them.  This one was pitch black  not redish brown  and it was seen in bright daylight in the middle of the day.  It was chasing deer  which I think would rule out it being a vegetarian.  Another thing I thought really interesting was that a huge bird  maybe a vulture of some kind kept circling around where the thing was  like maybe it was waiting for it to make a kill.  My son insisted that it had a tuft of snow white hair on its head.  We didn  t report this sighting because we didn  t think anybody would believe us  plus  we didn  t want some gun-happy nuts trying to hunt it down.  My husband and I have been living out here ever since that time and we  ve been staring at that mountain for years  but we  ve never seen another one.  Never-the-less  I feel truly blessed. , ,Larimer,8,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8069,yes
742,My wife and I were elk hunting. We went up to our favorite area Beaver Meadows. We had decided to try a different area the next week. We went back up Beaver Meadows road and went off on Bear Creek road. We went down an old logging road. My wife and I had gone about 100 yards when my wife said do you smell that. I smelled the air and said no. I left her on a stump and I went a ways further. I found a place for myself. Looking over a meadow I started to smell this fowl wet musty odor. Then I heard a loud crack  not a gun shot  not an ax  but more like a log hitting another. I walked back to my wife and explained the smell and she said that was what she smelled. We started back toward the truck when my wife tripped. I looked down to see what she tripped on. To my surprise a huge track  not a bear  it was about 16 inches long and 6 inches wide no claw marks. There were two tracks. I am six foot tall and could not even match the stride. My wife was so excited about this she wants to go back this spring to see if we can get picture of the creature. ,The location was up Beaver Meadows off of Bear Creek road  east of Bayfield north of Hwy 160 ,La Plata,1,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8067,yes
743,It was in 1978... My former husband and I had taken our children for a picnic at Wellington Lake  just south of Buffalo Creek  Colorado.  What I saw was not the same as what I  ve seen in photos  however  what I saw was a bipedal creature with white fur.  This may sound strange  but  I was talking with my former husband when the creature stepped out from behind a boulder.  I told my now exhusband  to look.  He turned around but the creature ducked back behind the boulder.  My exhusband turned back to me and said   I didn  t see anything.  At that very moment the creature showed itself to me again.  I told my ex to turn around.  He did  and the creature ducked behind the boulder again.  This happened four or five times  and then the creature was gone.  The creature was partially bipedal and then would stoop like an ape and touch the ground. It had a human-like feeling about it because it was obviously playing some sort of a game with me.  I have never told anybody except for people I trust not to make fun of me.  I was a resident in the area for many years and I knew what wildlife was there...nothing came close to this creature.  I  ve seen mountain lion  bobcats  linx  badgers  deer  elk  bear  and many more creatures in that area  but nothing like this. ,Drive from Hwy 285 down 67. Drive through the small town of Pine.

744,The following was sent as a letter from a woman in Cheyenne  Wyo. to investigator J. Davis and transcribed to this form with her consent. I read in yesterday  s Denver Post about your encounter with a Bigfoot. I am 66 years old and here  s a story that happened to my Dad in 1926. My father was an avid hunter and fisherman. He always had binoculars with him as he liked to look at everything. He was up around Walden  CO and saw what he thought were two bears stalking an elk. I don  t know if the elk was part of a herd or was cut out and was alone. Evidently  it did not know it was being stalked. Dad said he was a long way off  he was on one side of a mountain and this was happening across a valley on the side of another mountain in a partly open area. There is heavy timber in part of this area. When he got out his binoculars and started watching  he still thought they were two bears until they started walking. He said they were a brown color and quite large when they stood up and started walking on two legs. He watched them for about five minutes  until they got into some heavy timber. They did not stalk real close together- they had the elk in the middle. He said they were excellent stalkers and would even hide behind a tree for a while. He said he didn  t know if they killed the elk or not but thought they probably did. He was sure they were carnivores or they wouldn  t have been stalking in this manner. The incident took place in the late afternoon. There were very few people living in the area but who knows  there may still be some of the critters up there. Glad I  ve never run into one the way you did. ,Walden is in a high mountain basin known as North Park. It is surrounded by the ranges of the Continental Divide on the east and the Mt.

745,This event took place a couple years ago.  I have a biology degree and work as a wildlife biologist.  I usually don  t tell people about it  but after reading some other stories on your web page -why not. I was with a group of friends hiking up to a mountain lake called Lilly Lake on Mt. Blanca.  After hanging out at the lake we had all started to turn back.  After a while we decided to race down the hill off the trail back to camp. (last one there was cooking).  I hung back with another friend to just walk back and carry people  s gear.  Shortly after everyone took off like a bat out of hell  we saw something jump between two trees.  The figure was stretched out like someone doing a jumping-jack while jumping in a lunge.  It must have been at least 6 feet tall.  At first we thought it was my brother messing with us  he was the only one in our group tall enough.  Both me and my friend have a lot of outdoor experience.  It was positively not a deer  sheep  elk or a bear.  Although it  s color was very similiar to the light-grey of a mule deer during that time of year.  The arms were clearly visible as were the legs  but it moved very fast between the trees.  At first we joked about how it looked like a bigfoot creature  but blew it off as my brother.  When we got back to camp everyone else was there and we noticed that my brother had a red shirt on  and was the second one back at camp.  It rained that night and was a steep hike so we never went back to look for tracks. ,(I  d like to note that I  m not sure it  s Huerfano county....Alamosa is on the other side of the mtn.) To get to Lilly Lake  you drive through Gardner  CO on Hwy 69 (west?).  Stay straight until you get to a fork on a dirt road.  Go left to Huerfano creek.  stay on the road for a good ways.  It turns into a 4x4 road after awhile and ends at the Lilly Lake trail head.  The trail then leads right to the lake (a good steep hike).  The sighting was very roughly about 1/3 of a mile down hill from the lake and 1/3 of a mile to the west off the trail in the trees. ,Huerfano,1,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8055,yes
746,I was bow hunting with my wife Joyce.  I pulled off the road and parked my jeep.  It was the middle of the afternoon.  As we were walking up in the timber we kept hearing things behind us.  I knew it was big because of the noises we were hearing.  We would walk and it would start walking and it would stop whenever we did.  I never saw it but we knew it was there. We were walking very softly through the quakies and I saw an ear flicker.  I drew my bow and the deer stood up.  It was a four point buck.  It was about 50 feet in front of us.  When I shot and hit the deer the it fell.  Immediately whatever was behind us let out a loud  shrill  deep-throated  dragged-out chirp. I cannot explain it as I never had and never have since heard anything like it.  I have spent my whole life in the mountains of Colorado and think I have heard just about everything. This was new. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I knew it wasn  t a bear because I know a bear is not capable of that noise. The deer stood up and kept going down the hill to the right.  We followed the deer and the thing behind us kept following  thrashing the brush all the way.  It sounded like it was breaking over trees.  It was ticked off because I shot the deer.  I never saw it because it wouldn  t come out of the trees.  We decided to forget about the deer and high-tailed it out of there as fast as we could.  I haven  t went back in those trees since. ,Near Longs Lake  about a quarter mile west of the lake. ,Gunnison,3,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8051,yes
747,My uncle and I were elk hunting near Fossil Ridge northeast of Gunnison  CO when this incident ocurred.  It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it  s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it  s  hands  and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit. It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking  nothing can move like that! .  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big. I estimate it  s height as 6  5    .  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell  at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine. After we calmed down a bit  we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn  t find anything else. ,The south side of Fossil Ridge near the base of it in a dry creek bed that runs east and west and has a game trail running along the north side of it.

748,I was camping with my family around Taylor resivor  towards Aspen in a Coleman pop-up camper.Around midnight I heard something moving or licking our cast iron skillet that was washed and left by a tree outside our camper. I got up and opened the door of our camper expecting to see a bear. At that time my friends dogs that were sleeping in his tent about 100 feet from our camper strated to bark. In the distance I saw a large dark object running into the woods. The suprising thing was that our camper started to shake rapidly. In the morning I asked my wife if she could feel the camper if I ran by it. I weigh 220 lbs and couldn  t make it move at all. When this animal ran away from it it felt like an earthquake. Very Strange. , ,Gunnison,3,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8051,yes
749,I had gone backpacking/training trip with four pack animals in preparation for an extended backpacking trip into the Wemineuch Wilderness.  Two of my goats are experienced packers and two were new.  After several shorter treks I had gone to Spring Creek Pass where I planned to walk part of the Colorado Trail -- possibly down to Durango -- then resupply and go back to the Wemineuch.  After reaching one of the local creeks one of my goats started getting sick so I decided to head back toward the truck and bide my time while I assessed his situation.  There were tons of people on the trail last summmer and I wanted to be alone so I went off near Jarosa Mesa and found a meadow surrounded by thick forest where I didn  t feel I  d encounter anyone.  We stayed two days. During that time the dogs and particularly the goats were periodically nervous  then they would calm. Goats point to what they see or hear but whenever I would look I would not see anything. I checked the area thinking there might be bear or mountain lion nearby but didn  t find signs that would indicate a den and although there was bear scat in the area it was not fresh.  Still  this was a time of drought that had the bears hungry all over the state and they were having bear problems down in Lake City right then so  especially with a sick goat  I stayed alert to the possibility.  Especially since I was also near one of the only water sources. In the meantime I was doctoring my goat and working with the others. At one point when I was playing tug-of-war and growling with my dogs (an older border collie and a border collie pup) the goats alarmed and bunched around us pointing at the woods but when I checked I couldn  t see anything and the dogs didn  t react.  I periodically got the feeling we were being watched  then it would pass. The puppy occasionally got interested in something in the woods but would come back. When I work with the goats  I sing a lot.  They have also developed a fondness for the pennywhistle so I had spent a lot of time in the afternoon just playing music with all of us sprawled around the meadow together. The meadow was rich in smells but aside from the plant smells from walking around there was more a musky elk smell than anything.  Lots of signs of deer and elk in the area.  At dusk the animals got extremely nervous. I had just gone inside my tent to get something  both dogs were inside with me and the goats just outside.  I suddenly heard this alarm vocalization unlike anything I  ve ever heard from my animals  but easily could have been.  Under the circumstances I could easily have made vocalizations I had never made before. The goats were beside the tent and whatever it was was right behind the tent. I knew it was something big because my dog will tear after a lesser beast barking but the only times I  ve encountered a bear or a mountain lion with him he stays right with me and gives a quiet growl that says   This is serious.    I grabbed my pepper spray fearing it was a bear and started out of the tent  turning as I crouched out the door and yelling (don  t ask me why) at the dogs to stay inside. The goats were beside the tent pointed at the back.  There it was. A bigfoot. I couldn  t see its whole body because it was blocked by the tent but if it was a female the breasts weren  t prominent.  It had medium chestnut fur  was standing erect on two legs  probably 8 feet tall (I have a brother who is 6  7  and a nephew who is 6  10  and growing so I have some perspective)  and probably only 12 feet away staring straight at me.  The face had fur -- less around the eyes but not as bare as your sketch -- and the eyes were all brown -- no whites. Like a deer  s eyes.  Its arms were hanging at its sides. Everything was totally silent. My dogs were beside me but we were all frozen in place.  I know that if anything threatened me one of my dogs would die defending me.  On an instinctive level I was as terrified as I  ve ever been but even at the time I knew I didn  t feel threatened.  I wouldn  t have dreamed of using the pepper unless it had attacked.  In retrospect I thought it was interesting that I didn  t have (at least under those circumstances) fight/flight instincts. I simply froze in place.  Perhaps if it had done anything menacing I would have reacted differently.  But I felt simultaneously terrified (instinctively) and amazed.  Before that moment I had never even known if I believed in bigfoot or not.  Had I thought about it I would have assumed it would be something to ponder in the Pacific Northwest  but certainly not in Colorado.  Had never once  for all the thought I  ve put into  what would happen if I encountered...  thought of the possibility of encountering one and was totally unprepared for and in awe of it. It seemed unhurried.  We stared at each other for what felt like a long time  then it made a low rumbling sound and turned its head and I caught just a glimpse of another back behind it.  It looked back at me  then they turned and loped off out of sight.  I could feel the vibrations in the ground. I got the feeling that nothing in the encounter was threatening to me or the goats.  That they were curious. There was a slight breeze and I was upwind (somehow I doubt that was accidental) so I didn  t notice a particularly strong smell.  I think I had felt the vibration as it/they approached but thought it was the goats.  During the entire encounter from the vocalization on  except for the breeze  it was totally silent and the sound (birds etc) resumed a few minutes later. We all slept very peacefully that night. I found no tracks but the ground was so dry and hard I couldn  t make a very good track when I tried. The next morning I packed up and left more because I felt like I was intruding in someone else  s space than feeling danger.  I felt like I was being watched and gauged from the animals that they did too. My older dog stayed right beside me  alert and ready to act.  The puppy seemed unphased by it all.   The puppy had come back at one point earlier in the day having rolled in what I thought was human manure...now I  m not so sure. ,Near Jarosa Mesa down toward Rambouillet Park. ,Hinsdale,3,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8053,yes
750,My boyfriend and I were on the last night of a week-long vacation/road trip.  In the past few days  we were just driving through SW Colorado  driving through areas we had not seen before. We had driven over Spring Creek Pass (going South).  We drove West on a dirt road  into a high valley with a stream.  We parked during sunset/moonrise  just off the road and near the stream (a pullout-type area).  My boyfriend wanted to get some fishing in before it got too dark.  So we quickly started to get a quick dinner together (soup) and get our gear ready for the night.  We were not going to put up the tent  but instead took some gear out of the truck bed (truck has a topper) and we were going to sleep in it.  We were moving pretty quick to get this stuff done so he could fish  so I guess we weren  t paying much attention to other stuff.  We did stop to take a few pictures of the rising moon. He went over to the stream to fish  and I started to eat my soup in my camp chair.  The bushes near the stream were very tall and thick  and I couldn  t see my boyfriend at all.  There were more bushes on the other side of the truck (between the main road and truck).  I was just eating my soup  when I heard loud crashing through these bushes (between the road and truck).  It sounded like something very big with very long legs stepping through the brush  and it was coming right towards the truck.  The brush came very close to the truck (less than 10 ft). At first  I thought this might a moose.  (We had seen moose in the Northern Colorado mtns earlier in the spring  and we had seen a sign posted near the road warning a moose had been seen in the area ( Hunters  be sure of your target... ).  So  I first thought this could be a moose.  It was definitely very big and had long legs (much bigger than an elk  and not a bear).  (We have also seen bear in Colorado  so I  ve seen the size/movement of bear.) The last thing I wanted was a big moose (or anything else) to step out of that brush (and on me)!  I was very scared.  I quickly made room in the front seat  which were now filled with gear  and started honking the horn.  I wanted it to know I was there (because it sounded like it was going to pop out of there pretty quick).  The crashing continued but seemed to move off a bit.  Then it stopped.  I couldn  t be sure if it had completely moved away or just stopped.  My concern was also for my boyfriend.  I didn  t want a moose to come across him in the bushes by the creek.  My boyfriend heard the honking  and I could hear him coming back.  The bushes were very thick and he was swearing  struggling.  He returned  I explained the situation.  Irritated and with fishing pole in hand  he walked up to and down the road a short ways and didn  t see anything. If it were a moose we felt we would have seen it (he from the higher road or I would have seen it crossing the pullout to the stream).  My boyfriend would have been able to see if a moose was in/near the bushes near the truck  from that higher position.  At this point I heard very low growling  faint (very deep  very low).  It seemed to come from the tree line across the road and part way up the hill.  It was brief (seemed like 4 growls)  and over by the time my boyfriend came back.  I didn  t tell him at that point  because it didn  t make sense  and I didn  t want him getting irritated for my being spooked. He went back to the creek.  I sat in the truck and ate my soup  window half down to listen.  I heard more noise from the same area as before  this time loud splooshing and splashing (there was a drainage with water that was coming down from the hill to meet the creek).  The noise was very loud and distinctive  not at all like natural water sounds.  It sounded like something big splooshing in the water. My boyfriend came back  saying it was getting too dark to fish.  He sat in the truck with me and ate.  I started to tell him about the splooshing (which stopped when he came back) and the growling from earlier.  He was disturbed and said we should leave. We both knew it wasn  t a moose.  We felt he would have seen it from the road.  We also knew a moose would have not have just hung around making more noise once it knew we were there.  I thought it was too big to be an elk/deer/bear.  We felt something was still there and we couldn  t see it. We quickly put all the stuff in the truck and drove off. I was surprised that he was so scared  very unusual for him.  He finally told me that he had found big footprints by the stream  in the mud.  He said they were huge  much bigger than his print  and much deeper (the thing would have to have a large foot and be extremely heavy).  He had seen other tracks by the stream  from other animals and from a person earlier in the day (sneaker-type print).  He said no man could have made those bigger tracks.  He said the tracks also went into deeper brush.  When he was working his way back to the truck  he would try to follow these tracks out  but would only end up in deeper brush (thats why he was swearing). He said he was wondering at the time   Where is this idiot going?  Why is he going into the brush? .  He thought there were tracks from more than one  at least two  and from that day. I asked him  why didn  t he say something the first time when he came back. He admitted it took some time to process.  He also said that it felt like something was in there with him  in the brush. He said it took him time to put everything together  the crashing  the growling  the thing not leaving  the giant footprints  the uneasiness.  We both concluded it was likely a bigfoot.  Giant footprints like that are hard to argue with. The noises were made from a big animal   but he didn  t see anything from the road.  My boyfriend said these things must have been intelligent.  They seemed to be watching/waiting/hiding.  They knew when he walked away and came back. When we drove away from the pullout  I had a good look at the brush between the road and truck  and it amazed me how small an area it was.  If something big was in there  and it didn  t leave  it would really have to hide in there. I  ve always believed in bigfoots  but my boyfriend has always been skeptical (even despite the visual sightings by his step-dad  his friend  and his own odd experiences).  But he thinks it was a bigfoot.  I wish I had seen the tracks  but there was no way! Also  I don  t think I  ve ever seen my boyfriend that scared.  He just kept driving.  When we finally pulled over somewhere. He wouldn  t get out of the truck. ,A little South of Spring Creek Pass  to the West of highway 149.  Don  t know the name/number of the dirt road we took.

751,I want to share an experience my family and I had near Lake City  CO on June 12  2021. We have visited Lake City for several years in a row  spending a week there each summer. One of our favorite places is Deer Lakes  about 15 miles southeast of Lake City off Hwy 149. We always spend several evenings out there fishing  cooking out  watching wildlife. Also found in that area are two ponds known as the Upper Mill Pond  nearest Hwy 149  and the Lower Mill Pond another mile or two down the road. On our way to Deer Lakes this visit  we stopped at the Upper Mill Pond to fish  but we saw a cow moose and two calves just below the pond eating in the runoff creek. (We almost always see moose near Deer Lakes) While we were watching the moose from the cab of our truck  we heard the undisputable sound of a wood knock. At first  none of us thought much about it  until we heard another one. I was in the driver seat  furthest away from the pond and moose. My daughter was in the backseat on the driver  s side while my wife was in the front passenger seat nearest the pond and moose. The girls thought the sound came from the direction of the pond but I thought it came from the other direction. The pond  and road to Deer Lakes  sits in a valley between two ridges. The tree line on the east  or pond side  is only about a hundred yards away from the road while the tree line to the west  or opposite the pond  varies  in some places a few hundred yards from the road and other places not far off at all. My daughter and I got out of the cab of the truck to listen after we all heard the second knock. Then she and I both believed the sounds were coming from the west tree line. We waited  listening  and heard another knock  this time seemingly from a different position from the first two knocks. In a bit  another vehicle stopped to watch the moose. When they arrived  we heard another knock. A third vehicle drove past and we heard still another knock as it went by. In all   we heard what I would guess to be 8-10 knocks  from at least three different positions  but all on the west side of the road. My family and I talked about it. It was possible that there were a few guys in the woods making the sounds. Maybe one guy knocked on a tree  then another heard it and knocked back. That  s possible. However  what sealed it as a bigfoot for me happened later that night. After we heard the knocks by the Upper Mill Pond while watching the moose  we went on to Deer Lakes where we planned to fish  but our lines were too tangled. We did get to cook out though. As the sun went down  we left Deer Lakes but drove further away from the highway  waiting until it got very dark before we went back to town so we could se the stars really well. Just off Hwy 149 on the road to Deer Lakes is a staging area for people to park trailers to unload their ATVs. There is also a forest department bathroom there. That is where we parked to stargaze. As soon as we got out of the truck and shut the doors  we heard a knock from the east ridge of mountains. This tree line is several hundred yards from the road. It was not yet pitch dark. We could still make out the silhouette of the mountain against the backdrop of the sky  but it was too dark to make out any individual trees. I can  t imagine any reason any person would be up on that ridge  at that time of night  in the dark  in the cold  just waiting for the possible chance that someone would stop at that staging area and get out of their vehicle so they could hoax them with a wood knock. I believed  for sure  at that time that bigfoot were in the area. In full disclosure  I am a bigfoot enthusiast. I watch all the tv shows  I watch videos on youtube  I have been a member of forums. But I live near Amarillo  TX where it is flat  dry farmland. There is no bigfoot hunting around here. I do always keep my eyes open when we visit the mountains or wooded areas  but this is my first experience of anything that I would contribute in any way to bigfoot. On a related note  a few years ago on an earlier trip to Lake City and Deer Lakes  my family and I were getting ready to leave Deer Lakes. I had to visit the men  s room before we drove back to town  so my wife and daughter were walking up the path from the lakes to the parking lot. They heard what they described as an incredible crash  very loud and sudden. An adult male moose was in the upper lake eating when the crash occurred. This moose was frightened so much that he raced out of the water and into the woods  scaring my family terribly. When I came out of the restroom they were at the truck and asked me if I heard the crash. I had not heard anything somehow. They told me what happened and I instantly thought of bigfoot pushing over a tree in the woods up from the lake. There was no way for us to know for sure. The girls certainly didn  t want to go into the woods to investigate. So we could possibly have had two bigfoot encounters at or near Deer Lakes. I am almost positive we heard them knocking on June 12  2021. Thanks for your time. Sorry for rambling on so long about something probably insignificant to most people. But it was my first encounter and I was pretty excited about it. Let me know if you have any follow up questions.

752,This sighting took place in the summer of 1996 at Lost Lake which is about five miles north of Rabbit Ears Pass by a four- wheel drive road and trail in northwest Colorado.  It was late June and I was on a fishing trip to several lakes and beaver ponds in the area.  I was supposed to be taking a friend along  but he had to cancel at the last minute. I left my camp at Dumont Lake in the morning and headed up the four wheel drive road to the trailhead that leads to Fish Hook Lake and Lost Lake. It is usually possible to drive the three miles to the trailhead  but the road was closed by the Forest Service due to lingering snow drifts  so I had to hike the road. I arrived at Fishook Lake in the late morning and spent a couple of hours fishing and eating lunch.  About 1 30 I left that lake and began to hike to Lost Lake which is only a few hundred yards to the northeast. The trail I was on kind of funnels into the lake  and as the lake came into view I noticed a large  dark  animal about 20 yards to my right near a boulder.  My first thought was that I had suprised a bear  so I froze and waited to see what the animal would do.  It was soon obvious that this animal was not a bear or any other animal I had ever seen.  The animal was standing on two legs and was slightly crouched  it appeared to be staring across the lake.  When it saw me  it fully crouched next to the boulder with its left hand resting on the rock. What I saw is best described as a large  hairy bipedal animal that had features of both a man and an ape. The animal was covered with shiny  dark hair that was approximately 3-4  long and was somewhat shorter in the face area.  The animal was huge and the arms appeared very long as opposed to a person  s.  The head was somewhat dome-shaped and was set on massive shoulders  the neck appeared very short.  The animal  s eyes appeared below a slightly sloping forehead and there may have been a brow ridge.  The eyes were dark and the nose was flat and wide.  The face was dark and the lips appeared thin. I never saw the animal open its mouth or display teeth. After the animal crouched  it again looked over the lake then back at me.  The animal then stood up and to my relief pivoted away from me and began to walk away from me at an angle.  I moved forward to get a better look and the animal must have heard me move because it began to move quicker and glanced back at me.  The animal walked briskly into the trees and I heard it moving for a couple more seconds then it was out of earshot.  The whole event lasted between 8 and 12 seconds. I realized at this time that this must be the bigfoot of legend  but I had thought that they lived in the Pacific Northwest and were probably a myth  I certainly had never heard any reports of sightings in Colorado.  I briefly thought about following the animal or looking for some good footprints to show the appropriate authorities  but I was alone and the animal was big  I would conservatively guess it was around 7 feet tall and weighed over 300 pounds  so I left and hiked quickly out of the area  not slowing down until I got to my truck. After getting back to camp  I debated about what to do and finally decided the potential ridicule if I reported this to someone and the animal was not found was not worth it.  I watched the media for any unusual reports of bigfoot-type animals in Colorado in the months and years after my sighting and a few reports did indeed trickle in.  I got on the internet to further research the subject and eventually spoke with a BFRO researcher about my encounter and he urged me to submit a report. ,Lost Lake  just north of Rabbit Ears Pass  in the Routt National Forest. ,Jackson,47,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8057,yes
753,I believe it was in September of 1995 or 1996 and a friend and myself were up elk hunting during archery season. The area we were in was a few miles north of Colorado Highway 14 and a few miles west of Cameron pass. It was a parcel of Colorado state forest service land that had just recently been opened to hunting. It was aprox. 8 00am and we were moving north through the trees on the east side of a fairly large clear cut. It had just snowed that morning  so our movements were fairly quiet. I was using a diaphram call trying to imitate a cow elk in estrus (a series of higher pitched squeals and mews). As we were moving along I was warching off to our west to see if I could spot any movement in the aspen on the uphill slope on the west side of the clear cut. It was then that I saw movement  a large figure stood up from a short bit of growth. At first I thought that it might be another hunter  but as I looked closer I could see no weapon that it could be hunting with and the size seemed to be to large for a person. I stopped movnig at that point and watched it  it stood and looked in our direction for about 30 seconds and then turned and started walking up into the dense stand of aspen on the hillside. The thing that really sticks in my mind is the way that it swung its whole upper body as it turned to leave  it is almost like it used the momentum from the turning of its upper body to make its whole body turn to leave. At that point I mentioned it to my partner and all he said was that it was probably another hunter  I might mention that he is the type of person that does not believe that anyting out of the ordinary might actually exist. It was only after I mentioned it to him that I raised the binoculars that were hanging around my neck and scanned the hillside for anymore signs of movement. I scanned the hillside for about five minutes and was unable to pick up any movement. We never checked the far side of the meadow where I first saw it because my partner was worried that if we broke out of the trees that we might spook any game that might be in the area. Also because he believed that it was another hunter he did not wish to investigate the area that I had seen it. All I know is that what ever I saw was not a person and was not a bear (I have seen those go up on two legs before)  I only know that I am not sure what it was I saw. It was a year or two later and my wife and I were looking at a bigfoot page on the net and found recordings of what is believed to be a bigfoot. When we heard it she mentioned that the sound I make on the call when hunting sounds very similar to the sound that was recorded. I don  t if this could have contributed to seeing what I saw or not  maybe it was trying to figure out what we were. I still plan to head back up to that area on horseback and spend a little time eventually  although I doubt that I would be fortunate enough to see that same sight again. ,It was a couple of miles north of the first access to the Colorado State forest land as you travel west over Cameron pass. I would rather that you did not post the exact directions as I would rather not have a horde of people going up in that area spooking everything in sight. Though I would be more than happy to help any responsible researcher in finding the loacation. ,Jackson,47,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8057,yes
754,A friend and I had just started heading home from a day trip in the conifer area of Colorado. As we drove down a stretch of road with approx 1/2 miles visibility  we  both  saw a creature run from one side of the highway to the other. This creature was tall considering we had been about 4-500 hundred feet away in the car. It effortlessly took a few long strides and cleared the entire width of the road. It was clearly upright on two feet  which at that point both of us looked at each other wide eyed  like we couldn  t really register what we  ve just saw. Once we pulled off to the spot that it had crossed  we both took notice that there was about 5-6 mule deer that seemed to be completely undisturbed or spooked. We both realized that if this was a human  these deer would not have been anywhere close to the commotion. This was my very first and only sighting and I  m absolutely positive what we saw was authentic. The mix of weather and the time of day reduced the hiker and tourist traffic that day  so the thought of someone playing games isn  t a viable conclusion to me. My friend is also convinced  since he was raised in New Hampshire and has had similar experiences. Since that day  I  ve been hooked! My friend and I are extreme outdoorsmen with many years of survival training  so we will be spending a lot more time in the area of our sighting soon. Just FYI  the exact area of our sighting was between Wellington Lake and scraggy mountain ranch. Thanks for taking the time to read this as I  m sure you get a ton of submissions. ,I gave a brief description of the location. It was a quiet day. There  s a couple shooting ranges close by which your normally able to hear  but clearly nobody was around. I  ve always commented to people I take up there that the sighting area is a great place to see wildlife crossing the road. What my friend and I saw that day was the furthest thing from what I  d expected to see crossing. ,Jefferson,56,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8059,yes
755,My girlfriend and I were on a short hike 2 weeks ago in Staunton State Park  in between Bailey and Conifer  CO.  We chose a route which would have less people  as I  d hiked the other routes in the park previously.  After hiking uphill along a stream for about an hour  we saw a rocky outcropping and hiked off-trail briefly to check out the view. It was very quiet out with little wind movement.  There were no clouds in the sky and the temperature was in the mid-50s. Time of day was approximately noon MST. We sat in the sun on the outcropping for about 10 minutes very quietly  enjoying the view and the weather.  We looked down below the cliff and noticed a gentleman riding a mountain bike quickly up the path with headphones in.  As we watched  we heard a very low growl which sounded like a startled exhalation -  Grrrrrrphhhh   followed immediately by a very different  higher-pitched  Whoooooooop.   The mountain biker seemed to hear nothing  as the headphones must have been too loud.  The two noises came from the same direction  approximately 30-40 yards below us on the outcropping through thick forest.  We were unable to see any animals  but the sounds were very clear and definitely came from the same animal.  The animal definitely sounded startled by the fast-moving biker. My girlfriend  s eyes got very wide  and she whispered to me that she had no idea what kind of animal made that noise.  I responded that she  d say I  m crazy  but that only primates make the  whoop  noise.  We climbed down from the outcropping a few minutes later and searched for whatever made the noise  but were unable to find anything  nor heard any more sounds.  We definitely did not feel threatened in any way. ,Staunton State Park ,Jefferson,56,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8059,no
756,I lived for about 7 years in Leadville back in the 1970â€™s and that town has a long history of Bigfoot reports.  While living there I was involved in several related situations. One of my foster sons was employed for a time with the U.S. Forest Service working in the sign maintainence shop.  They had quite a rash of Forest Service signs being ripped down.  If you are familiar with the signs they use they are constructed of massive timbers and quite sturdy.  Some of the signs were over 8 foot off the ground to the top yet they had been torn down with apparent ease.  At first they suspected local teenagers or possibly bears as being responsible.  To make it more difficult for the vandals the Forest Service put a thick layer of grease along the tops of some of the signs.  Within days  one of the signs was again vandalized.  The grease on the top of the damaged sign show a huge human like handprint. A few weeks later we decided to go on a late night cruise in the area where the damage had taken place - just a mile or two below Turquoise Lake west of Leadville.  The dirt road we followed had a steep drop off to a stream on the left.  To the right was a large open sagebrush meadow with thick timber behind.  A large boulder  at least 15 feet tall  was in the middle of the meadow.  We had stopped on the road above the stream and were visiting when we heard something  sloshing  in the water below our vehicle.  When we trained a spotlight on the area  the sloshing stopped  only to start again when the light was turned off.  A few minutes later we spotted a large figure run across the road about 100 yards in front of our headlights.  We also heard heavy footsteps crushing the sagebrush.  We immediately drove to the spot where we had seen the creature and checked for footprints.  Non were found but a trail of mashed sagebrush lead towards the treeline.  We swung the spotlight around the area just in time to catch a glimpse of a dark primate  about 7 - 8 feet tall  cross in front of the aforementioned boulder and disappear into the dense forest behind the meadow. I donâ€™t remember any particulars but believe the incidents occurred during the summer of 1975 (probably July or August) and time was sometime around 10 pm. , ,Lake,37,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8065,no
757,A two part vocalization was heard at 01 33 AM MDT  23 October 1994. The vocalization was extremely loud and sounded as if an enormous man was bellowing. The vocalization was followed by at least one and possibly two response calls. The response calls were of a warbling or yodeling nature. At 01 40 MDT  I heard two strings of high velocity rifle fire from the same direction as the response calls. The area was searched and spotlighted to a distance of 2 Km north and south of our campsite without results. The incident was reported to Dr. Grover Krantz and John Green who provided me with a recording of an alleged Sasquatch vocalizing near Puyallup  Washington. The vocalizations that I heard were nearly identical to the vocalizations on Mr. Green  s Puyallup tape. ,12 km south of Leadville at an elevation of about 3000 m MSL on the eastern foothills of Mount Massive south of the Leadville Fish Hatchery. ,Lake,37,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8065,no
758,My husband and I had been camping and were just out in the afternoon for a casual ride to see the scenery.  We had travelled only about 7 miles out of the town past some old mines in the area.  The road we were on was a slight climb and ahead of us maybe a quarter of a mile ( if even that) was a curve coming up that went to the right.  I was driving and had my eyes pretty much on the road itself when my husband began stuttering and finally got out   Stop.  To the right . . . what is that?   We observed a large  black animal on two feet  just like a man  walking through a clearing of pine trees toward the mountain side which was away from any roads.  I think we were both in shock when we saw it and didn  t really believe what we were seeing.  The thing that really sticks out about it was the long arms that hung nearly to the knees but it didn  t lumber or swing it  s arms like an ape does  although the arms did swing . . . about like a man  s walk but I guess the arms were more noticable because they were so long.  It also took very huge strides but in no way acted like it was in a hurry.  It all happened so fast I can  t recall many more details about it  I just know it has always sort of bugged me and I  ve wanted to see it again.  If I had to make a guess at the height I would say 7 feet or a little more.  My husband is 6  5.  By the time my husband and I snapped out of our daze it was gone and the really frustrating thing about it too  is that we had a camcorder right by our sides and neither of us even thought to grab it!  I  m a really bad judge of distance but I would guess it was a little over 100 feet away from us when we saw it. ,Sighting occured on an unspecified road east of Leadville in the Pike-San Isabel National Forest.

759,My wife and I were about to start a fire for a barbecue at our ranch south of Leadville.  We had just got the fire started when we heard something like a holler or a yell in a very deep tone.  The first vocalization lasted   about 5 seconds.  Then after a moment it hollered again.  We have a large pasture behind the house where we graze our horses.  After the second vocalization the horses were running  full blast  towards us.  When they got to us they were very spooked.  Then it hollered again  stopped  and then uttered a few short very gutteral noises. We put out the fire and left  since the sounds seemed to be very close  at the tree line on the end of the pasture.  I would estimate the distance was no more than a quarter mile away. The noise this thing made is hard to describe or mimic.  It had to be felt as much as heard. It was deep low frequency holler that vibrates in your bones and literally shakes your guts.  You could tell it was a very large animal that was making the noise.  We have had our ranch for a number of years.  This is not the first time we have heard these noises. This was unique  because it was the longest  lasting over a three to four minute period. We have also heard what appeared to be rocks  clacking  together  and then  clacking back from a farther distance as if they are answering each other. ,Witness requests anonymity.

760,On Sept. 4  2001  I climbed Mt. Massive  southwest of Leadville. The route I took starts at the Mt. Massive trailhead  in the wooded valley where the Colorado Trail crosses Halfmoon Creek. The elevation of this area is just over 10 000 feet. Near the end of this long hike  at about 6 30 PM  I was approaching the trailhead parking lot  maybe several hundred yards ahead  when I heard an animal walking through the trees to my right. The trees in this area are dense  so I couldn  t see anything moving. But I could clearly hear loud footsteps crunching through the underbrush  about 100 to 150 feet away. I was not particularly worried  because the animal was rapidly moving in the opposite direction I was headed. After about 10 or 20 seconds  the animal made a loud  deep  resonant bark  like a combined dog bark and foghorn. The crunching footsteps continued moving away  when after 20 or 30 seconds  the animal made another loud bark  exactly like the first. I didn  t hear anything else. I never saw anything. No one else was in the area.  I immediately presumed this animal was a black bear. This explanation seemed satisfactory until a few months ago  when I found out that black bears don  t make any sound similar to the bark I heard. Also  the footsteps sounded as if made by a bipedal animal  but bears don  t walk on two legs. ,On the Colorado Trail  a few hundred yards east of the Mt.

761,I was determined to summit Mt. Elbert  the highest peak in Colorado. I had made 2 previous attempts in 2001 and 2000 and on both attempts I was turned back at 13 000 ft. by weather. I have always gone solo. On this day May 29th 2002 I left the Black Cloud Trailhead at 7 00am solo. I summited Mt. Elbert at 1 45pm. The weather was perfect and unseasonably warm. There must have been very little snow during the winter because there was very little snow left even at summit. I stayed on top for 10 minutes took pictures with my digital camera. My sighting occured around 3 30pm at approximately. 11 500 feet. I was decending and very tired.The trail is not very popular because of its steepness and because it  s very rugged in spots. I did not see anyone the whole day. I was traveling on the trail through the only level portion which is a high mountain plateau that lasts maybe 300 yards. The trail hugs an avalanche area to the left and to the right is a pine forest which is moderately dense. As I was walking I heard a fairly high pitched but gutteral cross between a scream and a growl. It must have been heard for miles. I froze in my tracks and unsnapped my holster. I scanned in the direction I thought it originated from but it  s hard to tell in the mountains because of echo. I looked to the right first into the forest and saw nothing  then slowly did a 360 scan and now I  m looking back to the forest. At 50 yards I spot the bigfoot. It is standing still facing me approx. 7 feet to 7 1/2 feet tall. I was wearing army camo and I think it had a hard time figuring me out for a few seconds. I was so scared and astonished at what I was looking at I could not move.Then suddenly it turned and ran with a huge stride and it was fast. Its color was black and brown mixed and its fur or hair was thick and matted in spots. It ran like a man except with a slightly haunched upper back and a much bigger and more powerful gait. I lost sight of it in about 10 seconds after it began to run. At this point I pulled my pistol and immediately started cautiously down the trail. My heart was beating so hard I thought it was going to come out of my chest. I could actually hear it beating in my ears.I was no longer tired and the adrenaline was pumping. All the way down the trail I was doing looks over my shoulder and scanning everything. My camera was in my light backpack and I didn  t even think about it till I got back to the cabin I rented. I know what I saw and nobody can take that away from me but I didn  t dare talk about it until I accidently stumbled upon this website. I hope this helps your research. ,At 14 433 ft. (4409m) Mt. Elbert is the tallest peak in Colorado. Located in the Collegiate Peaks Range inside the San Isabel National Forest. Mt Elbert is surrounded by designated wilderness on the north  south and west. It is quite close to Mt. Massive and Twin Lakes. This part of Colorado  s high country  which lies between Aspen and Leadville  has been one of the most consistent generators of sasquatch reports going back to the mining era of the 1880s.

762,The BFRO Colorado Expedition was conducted in a remote area in the same part of Colorado as some major ski areas -- Vail  Ski Cooper  and Breckenridge. The area was heavily forested and had plenty of water. The expedition was well planned and was executed well. The majority of the participants arrived at the initial base camp location on 8 Sept and individual camps (groups of two-three) were positioned along the drainage. We had all been briefed on the history of sightings  tracks  and vocalizations in the area   and the methods we  d use to determine their presence. We spread out that evening  stayed in touch via walkie talkie  and conducted wood knocking and calling in an coordinated manner. We had night vision devices  recording devices  and IR detection equipment.  We worked well into the early morning hours (2 AM). Nothing was heard.  The next morning (9 Sept) the guides said we should move the base camp to another target area  because we would have heard any sasquatches the night before if they were in that drainage. We drove a few hours to a new location across the Continental Divide. The night of 9 Sept was spent in canyon near the new base camp.  Participants were positioned a half mile to quarter mile intervals (I think) with the sound blaster positioned in the middle of the group. The calls and wood knocks announced and timed so as not to be confused with a response. Nothing was heard. The next day (10 Sept.)  the focus moved to a different canyon  near where some possible vocalizations were heard the night before by one of the guides. A group of five or six worked the top of the drainage from well above the timber line and hiked down in the direction of the base camp.  Two others worked the road on ATVs above the valley  and a few others worked the hillsides above the drainage. I hiked up the same drainage starting from the base camp. As I was walking up the trail next to the creek  about a mile or so from camp  I was in radio contact with the group above me. We would announce when we would call or wood knock. We could hear the knocks and calls between us  but just barely. I proceeded to a fork in the trail and found an old hunting camp site that had been used in previous years but had shown no signs of recent use.  I started to take an old trail that went through the camp site when I heard two distinct and clear wood knocks to my left approximately 150 - 200 yards away at most â€“ close enough to startle me significantly as I was by my self. I stopped and immediately got on the radio â€“ no one was within a mile of two of me and no one had said they were knocking.  The sound was much closer and more distinct that those made by the guys way up on the ridge above me. After about two minutes  I picked up a large stick and made two or three loud wood knocks in reply.  I got an immediate response of two knocks that appeared to be a little farther away (maybe 300-400 yards) but still very clear.  The knocks were similar to the first I had heard but just a little farther away. I responded again with knocks and then a whoop or two over a 30 minute period but got no additional replies.  I was alert to any movement or smells in the area but noticed none. Eventually I decided to return to base camp.  After arriving at camp I linked up with a few other guys. We road ATVs to the location where I heard the knocks to investigate further.  One guy took the ATV further on the trail that forked to the left at the old camp site. He went for about .7 miles in the direction where the sound came from. He later said he noticed a musty smell in that area.  The group that worked the drainage from the top had found a couple of sets of tracks (which they photographed). I saw the pictures and thought they were pretty clear. As they moved down the valley they also noticed a distinct smell about 500 yards to the left of the above referenced wood knock incident. This is the same area where Lee picked up the smell and turned around on the trail. Some things happened later that night around the base camp. I  ll let the others describe those incidents.  I recommend that as a prerequisite for attending expeditions  each attendee should listen closely to the Sierra Sounds CD.  I bought it after the trip and wish I had heard it before the trip. It gives a good understanding of what they sound like  the wood knocks  the vocalizations  and all.  The expedition guides from the BFRO were very informative and helpful. They brought a lot of experience to the event. The guides from Colorado had extensive knowledge of the encounters in this area  including some of their own. Other attendees were witnesses from Colorado. I hope to work with the Colorado guides and the other newbies over the next year (may even be up for a trip to Wyoming). I now have a working sound blaster  and a couple of digital trail cams â€“ enough to be dangerous.  I hope to attend some of the other expeditions over the next year (Oklahoma  Arizona or Oregon) and work with this group again. My wife thinks I have lost it. I have to get her involved.  , ,Lake,37,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8065,no
763,(Job title edited at witness request for privacy).  I am currently on a contract in Rifle Colorado.  My home is 5 1/2 hrs south of Rifle so I stay in my camper 5 days a week.  This morning  I left my home at 0245 as per usual.  I stopped in Buena Vista to fuel up and get a coffee.  As I came thru the little town of Twin Lakes  I was just feeling tired and the more I drove  the sleepier I got.  So before I started up Independence Pass  I thought I would pull over and get some fresh air.  (I had just noted that it was 36 degrees on the truck temp. gauge and even took a picture of it on my phone  to send to my brother in Virginia).  I pulled over to the left side of the road.  As I got out of the truck  I noticed movement in the meadow directly in front of me.  Not more than 3-4 miles below here  I had just seen a buck deer so I was thinking that I had probably flushed another deer.  As I walked to the rear of my truck  I continued to look out in the meadow and that is when I saw this thing move.  At first I thought it was a bear but it rose straight up and that is when I knew it wasn  t a bear.  A bear  s front legs hang in front of their belly when they stand and these did not.  The  arms  hung to the sides just like a person.  Only if this was a person  he was really tall.  It was furry and a deep brown/red in color. I was so frightened that I thought I would throw up.  As I moved back toward my truck door  it tipped its head back as if it was smelling the air.  When I opened the truck door  it turned  bent over and picked something up and began to run on two legs across the meadow away from me. Not running like sprinting  but running at a pace that he could probably continue for hours. Honestly  the thing that struck me most about this was the way it picked up  whatever it was  and carried it with both hands clasped together in front of its torso. By now I was back in my truck  shaking and tearful. I live in my camper 5 days a week.  I move from State Park to State Park.  I see wildlife daily.  I just saw a black bear Sunday evening and I know what they look like when they stand  how they grunt and grumble.  I know how they lumber and run...this was not a bear.  It was like nothing I have ever seen. ,Base of Independence Pass.  This is the border of Lake and Pitkin County. Just off the road  Hwy 82. ,Lake,37,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8065,yes
764,My family has a lot of private property in upper Cherokee Park by red feather lakes. A lot of deer and moose and elk.We went up for a elk hunt night  fall had just swept over camp. We got a fire going and had no other light. We could see about 40 foot or so  it was about 1 min after the fire got going we heard boom boom boom on the hollow ground. Out of no where there it was  about 40 foot away there was a white upright monster. It stopped  hunched down and turned to make a chilling stare at us for a sec. but it felt like time had stopped for me. I blinked and it stood up and was 10 foot or better. Seemed like it took about 7 to 9 steps and it was gone. All this took a little over 40 sec.  felt like a hour. ,287N out of Fort Collins to WY border then all old dirt roads from there and 4x4 ,Larimer,8,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8069,yes
765,My name is John  I visited my brother Howard in Boulder Co.Sept. 19 thru Sept 26 He has a cabin at Crystal Lakes   Co. near Red Feather Co. Elevation is above 8500 ft.We were at his cabin on Sunday but could not trout fish because of the snow for 2 1/2 days.Tues morning at about 7 30 I was standing at the front door of the cabin when I could see something black and walking upright heading for the aspen trees .I believe it was startled by a pickup truck comeing down this small dirt road. I ask my brother to look at this with the field glasses and I then look at it for several minutes as well as my brother.It looked to be about 7 to 8 ft tall and I estimated about 350 to 400 lbs. We went with a yard stick which is all we had to try and at least measure the foot print. It measured 17 inches long and 6 1/2 inches wide. We were going to track it for a while but the snow covered the tracks pretty good ,8 miles from Red Feather Lakes  Colorado. ,Larimer,8,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8069,yes
766,Visual Incident  I was spending the evening at a 2 bedroom cabin at the YMCA in Estes Park. It had been a cold  snowy day  and I had gone to bed rather early (around 8 pm.). I awakened at 2 30 and got up to look out the bedroom window  through the curtains  just to check on the weather  see if stars were out  etc. I noticed that the basement lights were still on in the rather large  two-story 3-bedroom family cabin. This cabin was about 75 yards directly SE of my cabin (in back of me). I assumed the lights were still on since children may have been playing games that night  and simply forgot to turn out the lights. I looked out the window of about a half minute with this thought on my mind. I didn  t see any movement inside the cabin basement  so I assumed the family had retired for the evening. Just as I was about to close the curtain  I saw a very tall  rather large  dark figure stride past the entirely of the basement  across the snow. The stride of this figure was very deliberate and determined. It did not waiver. It did not rush. The figure had long legs  and was mostly all legs. Its torso was solid and straight. It did not look human  I did not discern any clothing on it. I was puzzled at first  thinking   Who in their right mind would be outside in this weather  walking in the deep snow (about 1/2 foot or so deep) outside past the lighted basement of this cabin? The figure emerged from the right side of the cabin and was heading to the left side  which would have been toward the direction of the road and the next set of cabins (about 50 or more yards away). There were no other lights on at the time  but the snow held its own illumination in the dark. The basement back-lighting created the perfect silhouette for the striding figure. I only saw it swing its arms  it was not carrying anything. After I watched it pass  I closed the curtain (this episode lasted about 20-30 seconds) and then it occurred to me it had resembled images of what I have been informed about regarding sightings of Bigfoot. i did not have Bigfoot on my mind AT ALL prior to this incident. The image remained in my mind for a good while  so I got up and checked all the locks on the doors  just to feel more safe  since I was staying alone in the cabin. Auditory (Vocalization episode) The next day was especially snowy  almost like a white out. The snow was VERY thick and it was easy to get stuck  as the YMCA plows were working as hard and fast as they could to clear the narrow roads throughout the campus. It was very difficult to pass safely down some of the roads. I had just come out of the Mootz Crafts Center  and had gotten my car stuck. I was fortunate that some kind male guests spotted me getting stuck and helped to push my car out of a snow bank. They left quickly and went back inside the lodge nearby. The snow was falling quickly and heavily  and I was beginning to worry I might get stuck again. I was standing outside my car  trying to determine the best driving route to take  when all of a sudden from the back of the woods  nearby what I would determine was the Livery Stables  came a very loudly projected guttural (like from the deep part of the back of a throat) type of cry-moan. It lasted several seconds (about 4 seconds or so). I looked around to see if I could see anyone  but no one was out at all. The weather was far too severe. I stood by my car  opened the car-door  which made a squeak  and the sound uttered once again  almost exactly as it had the first time. Same loudly projected quality  carrying from somewhere back deep in the nearby woods. This time  I felt intimated and frightened. This sound did not match the sound of an elk  or a mountain lion or a person  or a kid being silly.  The bears are all asleep   I thought. The message that I perceived from it was  I am here. I can see you. This is my territory.  I quickly got into my car  closed the door and managed to pull away out of the deep snow  leaving the YMCA campus. it was a very eerie experience and I can still feel the chill going up my spine as I think of the impact of those howls on that very snowy day. ,Both incidents occurred on the YMCA Campus located in Estes Park. ,Larimer,8,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8069,yes

769,My husband and I went to check on a friend  s cabin on Storm Mountain north of Drake  CO. While behind the cabin we thought we heard voices like a small kid hollering I so went to see.  We were in the national forest behind the cabin. I went on ahead of  my husband. He has a bad back and doesn  t walk far. We had walkie talkies. I went on ahead where the sound was coming from. I was talking to my husband on the walkie talkie. When I went up the hill in the wooded area  I could hear limbs cracking like someone walking nearby. I saw a rock outcropping area. I felt like I got zapped by infra-sound. I took a picture in that direction of the noise and child like sounds. My phone went dead but my w.t. I had my was still working. I was disoriented and did not know which way to go so husband clacked rocks together making noise so I would know where to go. I was in a daze. I found my husband  went back to cabin and charged my phone to look at the pictures I took  and there he was standing behind a tree  looking at me. It sounded like there was more than one. Our friends that own cabin have heard sounds at night  it is in a secluded area. ,Storm Mountain  private road ,Larimer,8,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8069,yes
770,I was about 19 at this time and I was a youth group leader for a bible study in the mountains at a place called  Twin Peaks Bible Camp . At night we all played games like glow in the dark dodgeball or went inside the cafeteria to play telephone or mystery date. Sometimes before bed we would go out and watch the bats dive bomb small rocks we tossed up into the air under the light above the back door. Another game we played at night up there is called  Mission Impossible.  The idea is that a camp counselor goes into the surrounding woods whitch are cordoned off and hides as best he can. Everyone else (kids and group leaders) goes to find this person so he can give you a slip that says you found him. If you are one of the first five back you get ice cream or cake  some prize of that sort. Meanwhile the other counselors are out with flashlights patrolling around looking for you. If you are spotted you have to go back to the cafeteria and start over. While I was out looking for the counselor I was hidden in the bushes next to the road leading to the cafeteria. Behind me was the baseball field. It was illuminated by a bright moon out that night. I had ducked into the bushes because two of the counselors who were searching walked right passed me. As I was crouched into the thick of the bushes I was motionless listening for anything that would tip me off to the whereabouts of anyone else. Thats when it struck me I couldent hear any of the regular sounds from the woods. No chirps  no animal rustling  none of the natural sounds I was used to hearing out there night after night. As I started looking around I heard a light shaking of bushes adjacent to me in the baseball sidelines. I  m crouched about 5 feet from first base and the bushes were moving over by third base. As I watched figuring I would see one of the counselors or another searcher come out of the bushes  something else did. It was huge. Myself  I am 6  4  and leveled off this thing as it came out next to the fence whitch was 4 ft high. The fence came up to what I can only guess was its waist witch  I figure would put it about 8   to 8  5  tall  gigantic shoulders and a thin waist like you would expect on a bodybuilder. I was dumbfounded and shocked  but not scared as it didnt seem to know where I was or that I was even there. It stepped out cautiously and took a few steps into the open to cross toward the outfield. About two steps into the field it crouched down and looked toward the road as a couple kids who got caught came around the bend and walked by me with thier backs to the baseball field. Then as they got farther away I looked back and it was on two feet and was moving in a flash. It was across the field in about 5-6 second and into the woods alongside the mountain. When it ran I could see its whipsy hair in the moonlight  but I couldent make out a color. After It left I emerged from the bushes and spent the last of the evening in the cafeteria. My mother who was a counselor said I must have been cold because I was white as a sheet. This was not a bear  deer  or elk. Looking back on a once in a lifetime chance I wish I would have gone and done something fool hardy like tried to walk out to it. Though hindsight is always twenty twenty and I am glad I stayed put and just watched it. ,I know it was in Grand Junction. ,Mesa,2,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8077,yes
771,Four of us were bowhunting in the Douglas Mountain area on private property.  It was around 3 00 PM and my brother was bugling for elk on a hill about 500 yards away from us.  Our younger sister was with him.  Our dad and I were sitting in our vehicle and our dad began to bugle at my brother.  The commotion got a response.  We heard an eerie howling ooooooeeeeeeeeuuu that was very powerful.  In a way it sounded like a human trying to sound like an elk.  The area we were in is miles from other roads and had no other hunters.  Neither one of us was making the noise.  Our dad got out of the truck as the sounds began to draw closer.  He saw a dark brown flash of fur in the pinions and cedars.  He thought it was an elk at first but knew the color was wrong.  We have hunted all our lives and knew the sound was not that of an elk.  When dad realized it wasn  t an elk he became very nervous and jumped back in the truck.  When my brother and sister returned we asked them if they heard the same sounds and they said they did.  The closest sounds that resemble this are off the Bigfoot websites.  After the incident we quickly drove out of the area and we didn  t return to hunt again. ,East side of Douglas Mountain and West side of the Little Snake River. ,Moffat,3,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8081,no
772,While hunting in Moffat County  Colorado  my wife and I both heard a sound that was inexplicable to either of us. There is no doubt in my mind that what I was hearing was a vocalization of some sort. I have spent my entire life in Colorado  and spent quite a bit of time in the outdoors  and this sound was unlike anything I have ever heard  and I can not imagine any animal in Colorado that would be capable of making this sound. It started as a very low range roar  of sorts  and built in volume and range to a high pitched  very primal scream. The sound was very  very loud  and very  large   for lack of a better word. The sound came from an area closed to vehicles  and it echoed from the surrounding hills. The duration was about 6-7 seconds  and it was repeated 4 times in the course of about 90 seconds. This sound was so primal  so intense  so big  that it raised the hair on my arms and the back of my neck  and I was chilled as I have never been before in the wilderness. I know what bear  elk  raptors  and big cats sound like in Colorado  and I assure you  this was nothing like I have ever even imagined. ,At the southern end of the Danforth Hills  on private property known as the Morgan Creek Ranch  owned by the Colowyo Coal Company.

775,Nights of 9/4 & 9/5/1998 Vocalizations heard while camping. We arrived at Indian Mtn in the afternoon of 9/4 and set up 2 man tent at approx elevation 9 000 ft.  Stoked fire and retired to tent at approximately 2300 hrs.  No more than 15 to 20 min. later - loud but fairly distant howls heard eminating from the area to the east of our campsite. Dogs in adjacent neighbors properties were very disturbed and barked for sometime after hearing sounds in the area.  Sounds heard again approximately an hour later. *Was wide awake due to chill in air. Second night  approximately same time - same vocalization.  The dogs again were extremely agitated and would not settle down.  At approx 1 a.m. vocalizations heard again and faint groaning/growling sound.  About an hour later - shots heard in the area surrounding our campsite. When talking with neighbors below us  they thought a bear might have come up on to their porch during the night of 9/5.  Loud footsteps had been heard on their front stoop. I am an avid outdoors woman and not at all normally uncomfortable camping.

777,At approximately 0030 hrs. on May 12  2001  my children and I heard the worst sound we have ever heard in our lives. We were sitting at our dining room table eating a late-night snack when suddenly this very loud  frightening human/animal-like cry came from about 200 feet from our front door. It lasted approximately seven seconds or so. This sound was like something you would hear in a horror movie. It sent chills up my spine and immediately made me sick to my stomach. My kids and I were extremely frightened and we froze for about a minute or so. We could not move. It was like nothing we  ve ever heard before in our lives. My husband was gone at work  so it was that much worse. After we got over our initial shock  we ran quickly ran upstairs to my bedroom  where we remained until my husband came home. After reading a report on (the BFRO) page where it describes a rooster/dog sound (SR # 529  August 2000  Park County)  it sounded like if you put those two sounds together it would be very close  except 10 times louder.

779,This story was related to me by my Aunt last year  My Aunt and her husband are both Romany Gypsies living here in the UK  but once a year travel to Fairplay  Colorado to visit extended family - decendents of family that used to mine the area. They were staying in a Log Cabin with one of the family members  and had spent the first few days of thier trip walking the outlying forestry  and going to old mining sites and other places of interest. On the fourth day  they all decided to spend an evening out with a barbeque and invited over a few friends from a travelling show that they know from Iowa. At dusk  my aunt said that two of the travellers (J & S) returned to the barbecue  after hiking up a small valley for about 5 miles. Both were visibly shaken and upset. They told everyone that they had been followed by something at a distance of 30 ft or so for the past few hours  it smelled similar to old  damp caravan interiors and when J had shouted towards the creature  it seemed to back off slightly before violently shaking foliage. This is when they both panicked - as J could see   fur   as the creature moved  and thought it could  ve been a bear. My aunt requested that everyone leave just in case the   bear   had followed J & S back to camp  but due to inebriation most of the group were laughing  and didn  t take the story too seriously. At about 10 00pm  a fire was lit  and some of the travellers started juggling firesticks or playing thier instruments. My aunt thinks this may have been a lure  as over the festivities they heard a very loud  very high pitched scream just off the small clearing. One of the more drunken members of the group started walking and shouting towards where the vocalization had eminated - he later stated that he was   trying to communicate   - when a few of the people at close range saw what was described as   a very tall  very powerful ape-like creature   moving at first into the clearing  and then away from the camp at great speed. It had long beige hair  approx 6  long  and a dark area around the face and elbows. Everyone left the scene quickly and in panic - J left his very expensive juggling batons and a few other important belongings  so it is clear that they didn  t want to stick around. No-one wanted to return the next day to the site  and one of our relatives waited a week before going to look for lost property. Unfortunately  new fires had been lit suggesting that campers had been in the vicinity since  and no belongings or tracks could be found. ,Outside of Fairplay  in dense forestry at a clearing often used by caravans and campers. ,Park,24,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8093,yes

781,While headed back to Denver from Buena Vista  My wife and I saw something very large pass in front of another car. This car was in front of us by about 25 feet. The weather was not good as it was snowing and dark out.  I was driving about 12 to 15 miles per hour. At first I thought that it was a person getting out of the car infront of us.  This struck me as odd considering the weather and the time of night  not to mention the location. We were in a 4x4 pick up and I guessed this thing to be about 7 to 8 feet tall. Very dark body with a large head and huge hands. It crossed the highway in a smooth fluid motion  paying no mind to the vehicles coming in either direction.It crossed the road in three or four strides  then disappeared of to the west side of the road.

We were all sitting around the campfire. I was telling a story about a recent trip  at the same location where me and my coworkers had heard a very loud scream that sounded like a woman being murdered.  No sooner did I finish the story that we heard the howl or scream. The husband and two boys looked at me and were not very happy. They thought I was playing a prank on them.

784,About five years ago  in late Spring  I took my kids camping in the Lost Creek Wilderness area. They were 8 and 10 years old at the time. We go there quite a bit because it  s far enough away to avoid the Denver crowds that flood local trails and parks but close enough it  s not a days drive to get there. I have a spot near Tarryall Reservoir I have camped at several times before. It  s a few miles off the main dirt road up a jeep trail and during the week there are usually not many people there. I like it because it  s on a ridgeline overlooking a small valley. Itâ€™s at the end of the Jeep trail  so on the way up and once Iâ€™m there I can easily tell if anyone is in the area or coming up on our camp. We got there on a Thursday morning and I didnâ€™t see anyone on the way nor hear anyone down in the valley below us. I had heard bigfoot stories like everyone else but never thought about it or gave them much credit. I figured it was like alien abductions or something. Weird stories that happened in people  s imaginations but not real. I do know it wasnâ€™t on my mind when we arrived. We set up and hung out the entire day around camp. The plan was to stay 3-4 nights. We didn  t have a fire because there was a fire ban at the time. That night the kids went to bed as soon as it got dark. I went to bed around 11 30 pm or so. I was lying in my sleeping bag for about 20 minutes messing with my phone to see if I could get coverage and play some games. I could hear coyotes start to howl and bark down in the valley below us  where I believe they had a few dens. In the middle of this coyote chatter and barking I hear  about half a quarter mile in the valley below   this startlingly sound I have never heard before. I have spent years in the mountains. I have heard just about every animal sound there is. With the exception of coyotes  an occasional owl  ranchers cattle  and very rarely a screaming mountain lion most animals stay quiet at night. I heard two deep â€œWHOOOOPâ€ WHOOOPâ€ sounds coming from about a quarter mile in the small Valley below. The howling from the coyotes instantly stopped and remained silent. At first I thought maybe it was some drunk campers messing around. I had driven through the valley the day before and had seen no one there. Again I hear another series of loud whooping calls. I am running through my head what animal it could be. A bear? A mountain lion? Some sort of crane or bird? I hear it again. Did some ape escape the zoo or and get loose in the mountains? I start hearing what sounds likes someone beating two large pieces of firewood together. These sounds go on for another good 10-15 minutes. After it was over I stayed awake for several hours waiting for the noises to return. At the time I am thinking some idiots came in late to camp and were screwing around in the woods. The next day I walk down to the area I heard the noises come from  to check to see if anyone was there. Not a soul. I thought maybe whoever was there had packed up early and left. We spent the rest of the day at camp and hiking around. Later that afternoon  before dinner I shot some of the rifles I had brought. Amazingly my kids had slept through the previous nights noises and I didnâ€™t tell them about it. I didnâ€™t want to scare them for no reason. The kids went to bed around 9 30 and I stayed up. I figured I would stay up a bit later to see if the sounds would return. About midnight I decided to turn in and get some sleep. I lay awake in my sleeping bag for quite awhile. I still couldn  t sleep. Eventually I started to nod off thinking nothing was going to happen that night and whoever had been messing around the night before was gone. I am guessing it was maybe 30 minutes into a very light sleep later that I was startled awake to the sound of two very deep  and loud â€œWHOOOOPâ€ â€œWHOOOOPâ€ sounds. This time the sounds were much louder because the sounds were coming from about 70 yards from our camp near the jeep road below us. I am both half scared and half very pissed. I quickly jump out of the tent. I  m now thinking the jerks from the night before have decided to make this personal and have been stalking our camp and think its funny to wake us up in the middle of the night. I never go out in the woods without a rifle and a good light. (I have run into idiots out in the woods before). I heard the whooping noise a couple more times while I started to walk down the slope of the ridge about 25 yards. I was thinking if these people were armed I didnâ€™t want to engage in gun fight in the middle of my camp. I scanned the tree line with my rifle mounted light looking for movement. Each time changing positions after each scan. As I moved a bit further something off to my right and about 30-40 yards away went crashing through the woods. I know what somebody running through the woods sounds like. Whatever this was  it was very big and very heavy. I am thinking â€œwhat the heck  is Shaquille O  neal with them? It was running very fast and covering more ground than an average person could. It was also snapping branches and small trees like they were just grass. I could hear the heavy pounding of its large foot steps. At this point  my heart is pounding in my chest as I high tail it back to the camp. I donâ€™t know if this person is running away or trying to flank me.  I was now debating in my head on what to do. Wake the kids (I have no idea to this day how they slept through this) and break camp and leave knowing they will be scared to death when I do. The down side to that is there will be no one to watch our backs as we pack up and I get them up  weâ€™ll make a lot of noise loading the truck  and the trip out puts us down the jeep trail where I was hearing the noises to begin with. I elect my second option. I find a spot in the trees and shadows where I can observe camp and silhouette anyone approaching against the skyline without silhouetting myself. If anyone comes up the hill I will hit them with the light and confront and engage them if I have to. I figure anyone sneaking around my camp at night doing these things canâ€™t have good intentions. I didnâ€™t sleep the rest of the night. I sat waiting with my back against the tree the entire time. I never told the kids. I made up some excuse why we had to leave early that morning and never explained why I was so exhausted. Though the idea of bigfoot was in the back of my mind that second night  for whatever reason my logical side wanted to explain it off as some assholes playing games in the woods. Over the next week  after we got back home  I couldn  t shake both the question of what those noises were and was there a possibility that it was a bigfoot. I didnâ€™t really know what a bigfoot would sound like so I started searching google for â€œbigfoot soundsâ€ That  s when I came across this video. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuDRpYLsP5c At point  22 of the video I found the exact noises I heard that night. I have listened to it over a dozen times since. I also did some more research on the area. To my surprise I discovered that not only does the area have many reports of bigfoot sightings and encounters but that it is listed as one of the top 10 places to encounter bigfoot in the United States. I also found out there had been a documentary filmed in the area a few years before and featured in the film was Observatory peak; which I could see from my camp a few miles away. There have been so many sightings in the area that the nearby town of Bailey has since placed bigfoot crossing signs along their small town roads. Now when I go up to that area my mindset is a bit different. I look over my shoulder a bit more and I search the tree lines for anything that might be watching me. We went backpacking on the other side of the mountain last year. It was hard to sleep because I was waiting to hear those whoops again. I don  t know what it was for sure that night but I don  t think it was human. I will be back up there this June. We will see what happens.  ,About half a mile South of the intersections of CR140 and CR845. East of Taryall road and west of North Taryall Peak. ,Park,24,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8093,no
785,I was elk hunting alone and was having a hard time going to sleep so I was just laying in my bag at about 10 30 pm. Initially I heard what sounded like something clearing its throat but it was a very deep sound that was like nothing I  ve ever heard. 20 minutes later I heard what sounded like a rock land close to my tent and a few seconds later I heard another one land with a thud  neither sounded as if they rolled as the ground was damp from snow melt. Just after 11 pm I heard something come from the tree line behind me  wooooo   wooooo  from two separate locations as if there were several and they were talking to each other. Once the sun came up enough for me to see I broke camp and left and didn  t look around for sign as I was a bit unnerved by the whole thing. , ,Park,24,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8093,no
786,Oh my God is all that we can say. It is Thursday 08/23/18 and we are just getting to our vehicle from a harrowing hike. We were hiking the road at Kenosha Pass on the east side that takes you to the twin cones above tree line. We began our hike at noon and hiked up the road. We reached the twin cone tree line area at 3 30pm. It was a beautiful and uneventful hike until we were headed back down the road. My daughter had said she thought that she had heard a tree knock and I was being silly and took a rock and knocked on a large rock off of the road and then tossed the rock about 5 ft off of the road. Literally 2 minutes later we both heard multiple loud tree knocking and rocks were whizzing past our heads. The stench was unbearable-like nothing I have ever smelled before. My 21yr.old daughter began to scream and cry as we were under attack by someone or something. I was so startled that I just stood there frozen as this dark figure was staring back at me. I couldnâ€™t move. My daughter grabbed my arm and we took off. I had an air horn that I depressed 3 times as we were running away and that seemed to deter the rock throwing. The rock throwing continued for 5 more minutes as we ran down the hill. We were almost to our vehicle which was parked off the dirt road when we heard a loud guttural whoop off the road abit and we just kept running to the car so very very afraid! We made it back to our vehicle at 6 15pm. I will never return and we are not okay with this. This needs to be investigated please. ,The road on the east side of Kenosha Pass Campground that takes you up to the Twin Cones.

787,For the past several years  my hiking partner and I have been heading out to the Crested Butte area of Colorado for a week-long backpacking trip.  This year we both decided to be extremely aggressive and hike over an expanse of land we  d been eyeing on the topo map since our trip last summer. Because of the vast amount of land we would be covering in 5 days  we decided to acclimate so that altitude sickness wouldn  t claim us halfway through the trip.  We flew into Denver  spending a night in Boulder.  The following day we drove to Breckenridge and spent a night there.  Finally  we made it to Crested Butte and spent a night in town before hitting the trails.  On Monday  August 21  2000  we headed out on the trail toward our final destination  Snowmass Lake ,Included in above report. ,Pitkin,4,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8097,no
788,I lived in Colorado for 29 years. Eighteen of those I spent working at ski resorts. Over the years I  ve seen hundreds of deer and elk as well as dozens of bear  everything from cubs to large 400 pound males. In the last 4 years I  ve had 3 separate sightings of 4 creatures that I hesitate to identify. My second sighting occurred during February 2001 near Aspen. I was hiking with my dogs on BLM land at the base of Sopris Mountain. I was on a steep trail that snowshoers had packed down firm. My dogs began to sniff the air and get excited  so I knew they had picked up the scent of an animal. Then two dogs that live on the other side of the road and up the hill began to bark. When I looked down at them I realized they were looking at something ahead of us  not at me or my dogs. Sure enough not 50 yards ahead of me sat what looked like a gorilla sitting in the snow under the shade of a pine tree. It was looking at the barking dogs across the little valley. I could tell it hadn  t spotted me yet and I was determined to keep this one in my sight. The trail switched back to the right up ahead and I wanted to see it move when it did finally see me. After walking about ten more feet  I tripped in a deep hole in the snow that the snowshoers had left with their poles. I stood up as fast as I could only to see the back of a large furry head disappear over the ridge. I tried to find a path or some tracks to follow up the hill but without success. The snow was up to my waist off the trail so I couldn  t get any closer. ,Trail access was off a BLM access road  about 2 miles up West Sopris Creek Road  on the left. ,Pitkin,4,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8097,yes
789,I  m not sure even how to tell the events as they unfolded. All I know is that a large something followed me from a place I was sitting half way back to camp. At first I thought it was a back bear until I came to a large open field on top of the mountain. I had walked out of the heavy timber on a trail to an open field (the moon was very bright almost like daylight in the field   it was very easy to see my surroundings). I walked to the middle of the field  sat and waited  and nothing happened. So I continued on  reaching the heavy timber on the other side of the field on the trail. I turned and looked back and noticed a large black bump sitting where I waited just moments ago. Then it stood up and walked right at me. Then I said â€œHey youâ€ in a loud voice. Then it turned and it walked or ran very fast directly to the north into the timber. No noise  but it looked to be like a bear due to the heavy coat. But when do bears walk like humans? And it had a large swinging motion on the torso area. Very weird. So I  m afraid really to tell this story because I do not want my friends or family to know about this. It  s such a weird thing to tell people. ,The sighting location was about 7 miles east of Aspen at the top of the  Hunter Creek drainage of the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Area. ,Pitkin,4,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8097,yes
790,During an elk hunt Aug.28th to Sept. 4th we were camped in the Snow Mass Wilderness area. The first two days were normal with no activity. We were just glassing for elk and fishing. After the first day of elk season my friend Jim shot his elk and that night things started to happen. That night we put some loins on an old saddle rack ( about 4   high) for lunch the next day. The next morning they were gone with no trace of anything climbing or dragging them away. The rack would not of held up to anything of weight climbing on it. It was like something had picked them up and walked away. The next night one of the hunters was awakened by something pushing on his feet through the tent wall and asked his son if he was pushing on his feet but his son said no. The next night I was awakened about 2 00 am by something dragging my tent. I thought I was dreaming at first but realized I was  t. I grabbed for my light but the tent quit moving as I rolled over. My first thought was a bear was trying to break in but I could not hear any breathing like a bear would be easy to hear at two feet also I could not hear no moving outside the tent. I did not turn on the light hoping whatever it was if did nothing it would leave. I layed motionless till morning and never heard anything. At daylight I exited my tent and found an old elk jaw at the doorway and the tent had been moved @ 6  to 8 . I checked the elk jaw and tent for teeth marks or tears but there was none. Whatever had moved the tent would had to of had hands and had to of gripped the tent by each cornerabout 6 1/2   apart because the rain fly would have been in the way.I did not tell the other two guys in camp because I didn  t want them to think I was crazy. Then as we went out to track an elk that morning as we cleared the trees by camp we heard 3 whooping typ calls from the thick pines above camp.The two hunters just looked at each other and said what the hell was that. I said I diddn  t know and started walking. That evening Jim had returned from packing his elk out so I told him what had happened. That night something spooked one of the mules so bad it was trying to get loose so we went out to check but saw nothing. The next morning Jim and I talked about leaving and packed up camp and left with the other two hunters. , ,Pitkin,4,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8097,no
791,A co-worker and I  were finishing up our shift at a donut shop when the incident occurred. At about 2 45 am  I had stepped outside after seeing a speeding car go by. When I did  I heard dogs barking and howling like they were barking AT something. But it was the howling that gave me the creeps. Otherwise I would have passed it off as a cat tormenting a dog.  I went back inside and said something about the incident to my co-worker  and we kind of laughed it off and finished up for the night. About 20-25 minutes later I was in the kitchen area when my co-worker screamed  GET OUT HERE QUICK.  So I headed to the front just in time to see a very large hairy looking thing just walking down the street right under a light as casual as could be. We both kind of stared at each other for a few seconds and then I opened the front door to get a better look at this thing walking across the street. What happened next is still very vivid in my mind  My co-worker said  do something  so I yelled  HEY!  It never broke stride but it turned its head and looked right at me. Then it walked a few more feet and turned next to a fence and walked past a car wash and storage unit and out of sight. One odd thing I noticed about this  thing  was it had long reddish brown hair from head to toe and it didn  t seem to have a neck. It was like its head was just sitting on top of the shoulders and it was very very large in size. It walked next to a chain link fence aproximately 6-7 feet in height topped by  three strands of barbed wire and this thing  s shoulders were even with the top of this fence. I personally didn  t see exactly where this thing came from but I suspect that it came out of the Sand Creek ditch which runs right through the middle of town. It  s a large ditch that allows water runoff from the mountains a few miles away. Several minutes later the guy who delivered our paper drove up. I had noticed him coming from the exact area where we had lost sight of this thing  so I asked him if he had seen anything back there. He said no but he heard something in an old abandoned building he used to store his extra papers and it scared the hell out of him so he left rather quickly. Just a few minutes later a police officer pulled in on the parking lot. Still feeling shocked and a little scared about what we  d seen I asked him to drive his cruiser back in the area past the storage units and see if he noticed anything out of the ordinary. We watched him drive back shining his spotlight back and forth and as he turned past the storage units we lost sight of him. Several minutes later he returned quite shaken and started asking me what I  d seen. I was rather evasive about my answers (he asked me several times what I had seenbut I never did say.) He then asked me if I  d seen a bear and I replied no it wasn  t a bear. Seeing him slop his coffee all over the table made me ask him what he  d seen and his answer was  I didn  t see nothin  . Nothin   at all.  None of us ever mentioned it again afterwards and I never really spoke of the incident again until I ran across your web site. ,The sighting occurred on Highway 115  the main street through Florence  CO. The setting was a commercial area with a nearby car wash  storage unit and donut shop with a nearby irrigation ditch. The town is just east of the Wet Mountains and the San Isabel National Forest. ,Fremont,5,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8043,yes
792,Sometime in the late 1970s  a friend and myself were winter camping in the Pike National forest outside of Colorado Springs. I dont recall exactly what month of the year it was  but there was still abundant snow cover all around our camp area.After breakfast  on a sunny morning  we decided to explore the area.The snow in the area was in many places  up to our waists. After trekking through deep snow   we came upon a trail that was located on a rise from the valley floor. we followed the trail for a short distance  when we came upon some very large footprints. Thinking how strange these footprints looked  (size  shape  ect.)   we knew that they were not of any animal that we knew of. These footprints looked human except that the were very large.( what would a bare-foot  huge person   be doing way out here in the middle of winter?)we were thinking! We followed the footprints for a while  untill we came to an area where two adjacent mountains joined  at that place the ! snow became very deep  and impossible for us to continue. The footprints  however  continued right up the area  never breaking stride  and not overly disturbing the unbroken snow. After returning home  and telling our story to our friends and families  and met with disbelief  we didnt discuss our sightings again... untill now! ,Footprints were sighted by myself  and a friend  while winter camping behind Pikes Peak  near Colorado Springs  Colorado. ,El Paso,7,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8041,no
793,EAGLE RIVER  COLORADO Track Find Investigation by Keith Foster; BFRO - Colorado/Kansas Photos by Bill B. of Eagle  Colorado In early April 2000  Colorado resident Bill B. noticed three large human-like tracks while fly fishing along the south shoreline of the Eagle River  approximately one mile east of Eagle  Colorado.  The tracks caught Bill  s attention because a different Colorado fisherman (Vern P. of Grand Junction  Colorado) reported finding a number of 18 to 20 inch long human-like tracks along the same river a few days prior. Vern had reported his find to the Vail Trail Newspaper. An article mentioning the tracks appeared in the 3/28 edition of the paper. Vern  s tracks were found on 3/21/2000  on a sandbar/silt/gravel area just west of the town of Gypsum  on the Eagle River. Gypsum is approximately 7 miles west of the city of Eagle. Bill B.  a resident of Eagle  thought someone should know about his find of similar tracks along the river  so he reported it to the Eagle County Sheriff Department.  Officers from the Sheriffs Department eventually went to the scene of the tracks.   Bill B. also submitted a report of the track find to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization via their web site (BFRO.net)  upon the recommendation of Sergeant Kaufman. As a Colorado investigator for the BFRO  I spoke with Bill B.  Sergeant Kaufman  and Vern P. to confirm the details.  Bill B. returned to the site a few times and documented the scene thoroughly. The photos below are low-res  reduced-sized versions of the photos he took. Track casts were not made because of the poor condition of the tracks at that stage.  The measurements and photos clearly showed that the tracks were not superimposed bear tracks.  , ,Eagle,6,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8037,no
794,At 5 30 A.M. on September 2  1997  I was traveling east on Highway 67  after I stopped to pick up my newspaper from our box on Hwy. 67  I was traveling at a slow rate of speed since I just started up after stopping for my newspaper when I observed in my headlights a large  black object run from the north side of Highway 67  across in front of my vehicle  and went up an incline on the south side of Highway 67. In my opinion  it was not a bear  elk  deer  cow or any other four legged animal as it was running on two legs with arms about two feet from the ground. It ran at a very rapid rate of speed and when it crossed in front of me it peered over it  s right shoulder which was curved and humped over. It continued it  s stride while keeping eye contact. I know I never saw anything like this and I lived in this area for twenty-nine years and never saw anything like this. I was very frightened and do not know what this creature was. ,Colorado  Douglas County  Town  1 mile west of Sedalia on highway 67. .25 mile southwest of County highway 105. ,Douglas,27,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8035,yes
795,Possible footprint observation  FR 578 near Hermosa Peak  Dolores County Colorado  Friday  June 20  2003 We were staying in a cabin northeast of Vallecitos on Middle Mountain  just off of FR 724.  I arrived in the area Tuesday the 17th of June.  We had spent several days in the area  including trips to Mesa Verde  horseback riding on West Mountain in the Weminuche Wilderness  and fourwheeling up FR 724 on Middle Mountain. Friday morning (the 20th)  we drove into Durango and rented a couple of late model Jeeps.  We drove out to attempt a drive on FR 682 but found it closed due to a recent fire.  The Jeep rental folks had suggested FR 578 as an alternate if we found 682 closed  so we proceeded north on US 550 to the PurgatoryDurango Mountain Resort area and picked up FR 578.  At the junction we followed FR 578 and took it up through the Graysill Mine and Graysill ghost town  over Bolam Pass  and then west from the junction with TR 638. We followed FR 578 until the trail terminates at a berm installed on a spur of FR 578  presumably installed to close the trail to motorized traffic.  While my wife and daughter and I stopped to eat lunch  my sister  brother-in-law and father hiked towards the base of Hermosa Peak (12 579 ft).  I estimate we were at approximately 11 500 to 12 000 feet  near the timberline. When they returned from their hike (about 3 PM)  my sister (age 28) reported that she had noticed what she thought looked like a large bare human footprint on a closed portion of trail  approximately Â¼ mile WSW from the berm. Having been interested in the Bigfoot phenomenon for some time  I though she might be pulling my leg but I took my video camera and we walked down the path together  looking for where she thought she had seen the footprint.  We noticed a large amount of Elk sign in the area  and what appeared to be motorcycle tire tracks. We had not noticed anything and had actually started back towards the area where the Jeeps were parked when she found the print.  I videotaped the print  and compared my hiking boot (size 12) to the print.  The print appeared to be perhaps 2 inches longer than my hiking boot which measures 12Â¾ inches  and about 1 to 2 inches wider than my hiking boot which measures about 5 inches wide  making the print approximately 14Â½ or 15 inches long by about 6 to 7 inches wide.  The print had what appeared to be a clear heel line  foot shape  ball print and toe marks.  The print appeared to be a left foot. As we continued towards the Jeeps  we found another print  much more clear than the previous print about 3Â½ to 4 feet away.  When we first observe this print I am clearly heard on the tape to say â€œOh my Godâ€ because the print was so obvious.  This print appeared to be a right foot.  Relative size compared to my hiking boot was similar to that noticed on the first print.  This print had more definition of the heel print  arch and ball print  indicated flexibility due to a sharp rock that would have been near the center of the foot  and had five very distinct toe marks.  The rock appeared to have been displaced either by whatever made the print  or subsequent to that by the passing of Elk or my family.  My sister joked at this point that â€œhe stubbed his toeâ€ due to the shape of the print and proximity to other rocks. About 3 or 4 feet further along the trail (heading back ENE) we found a third print that was not as easy to distinguish but which approximately matched the distance from the first to second print and was again similar in size.  The ground on the trail was getting progressively harder and more stoney  but this appeared to be a left foot again. No further prints were observed as we made our way back to the Jeeps  but we continued to observe Elk prints made in the muddy sides of the closed trail (evidenced by curling and ridges on the prints). I initially took the whole event in a rather non-serious way  even though I have been a real student of Bigfoot stories and research for sometime  especially during my teens and early twenties.  In hindsight  we could have marked the prints and tried to take more accurate measurements of gait  print size  even sketched them  as well as heading back down the trail (towards Hermosa Peak) where the ground was softer and more likely to have recorded additional prints.  We also could have looked around the area for other signs  there were several nearby stands of trees  snow and other fresh water sources. I do have several minutes of video that includes the surrounding area to verify my location and for reference  and this includes some clear images of all three prints.  I weigh about 180 pounds and made very little in the way of tracks in the dirt  with only occasional traces of boot tread showing in the same area.  I do not recall noticing ridges on the prints indicating they were not likely made while the ground was overly wet or muddy. I am 33  do not drink or smoke  work in management at an aerospace company  and am married with a 7 year old daughter.  Having had several days now to think about this event  and to have gauged the reactions of the few folks I have told about our observations  I am still not exactly sure what we saw and what I taped  but it definitely appears to be large humanoid footprints  made in varying terrain  showing a 3 to 4 foot gait and a foot that is somewhere near 14 or 15 inches long and about 6 or 7 inches wide. I am not a great outdoorsman but I am aware that some bear prints can appear almost human  but the video shows what I believe to have been clear human or humanoid footprints with no evidence of claws as on a bear. Honestly  the thought now that we might have seen footprints of a large animal such as Bigfoot is quite unsettling  and made me uneasy at night  both while in the cabin near Vallecitos  and even at my home in Rio Rancho  near Albuquerque. I can be available for any follow-up or to try and make copies of the video available if desired. ,See description. ,Dolores,1,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8033,no
796,In the fall of 1994 I was hunting deer with friends north of Hotchkiss  CO. This area was called Wolf Park. I had never hunted this area before but my friend had grown up in the area. It was the September muzzleloading hunt which runs from the second to the third weekend of the month. We had drove in quite a ways. We hunted the morning and I had seen nothing. About 9 or 10 am I had spotted a bear up higher so I figured we had better move to a new location  for the bear may have spooked any deer in the area. We walked down the trail to our truck and left the area. The time from seeing the bear until we left was about 20 minutes. The bear was heading north-east. We drove south-west down the mountain about 30 to 45 minutes. When we came around the corner of the road  it overlooked Wolf Park and a hill on the south side. My friend and I saw them at the same time. He slammed on the brakes and we bailed from the truck. We both started glassing 2 of the creatures standing in an opening. They turned and started looking at us. That amazed me because of the distance. It was quite a distance away. With the naked eye you could make out the size of the creatures  which - between that and the fact that they were standing up -  made us stop. We looked at them about 3 to 5 minutes and then 3 small ones walked out of the draw the parents had come from. They were about half the size of the parents. The creatures were jet black and you could see the arms and legs  torso and head. They started moving back to cover when a white pick-up came out on the road below us which was about 75 to 100 yards from where the largest one was. The truck came to an quick stop for 10 to 15 seconds   and then took off like a bat out of hell. The creatures disappeared into the brush. We drove to the spot we had seen them and looked at where they had gone. The slope was pretty steep and real loose. The dirt was so loose you could see that with each step they slid so I could not find a real good print. I had to jump in order to reach from one step to the other. The brush was thick in this draw were they had gone so we did not go looking for them. We left and went home. We talked about it for a week or two. It had gotten us excited but we never told anybody about this. I tried to bring it up one time a few years ago in conversation to my friend but he avoided the topic.

797,In late July of 1998 my youngest son (who was 18 then)and I lived in Western Arkansas and took a week-long camping trip to the Wet Mountains in Colorado west of Pueblo.  I had done most of the driving to get there and we arrived there well after midnight searching for a place to camp and fish.  My son does not enjoy crowds when camping so we looked for some place  out of the way  yet not too remote.  We drove up a forest service road near Ophir Creek looking for a campground we had seen a sign for.  As I recall it was probably three or four in the morning.  I know it was still dark outside.  We located the campground  but unfortunately it appeared to be operated not by the Forest Service but by a private individual who had very opposing views to the government and authority in general  as evidenced by a very descriptive sign at the entrance to the  campground .  My son and I continued on up the forest service road toward a place we later found to be Blue Lakes near Greenhorn Mountain.  As we were driving up this road which wound in an out of pine trees and open meadows we came to a long straight stretch of road.  As I approached this straight part of the road I notice a small  pocket  of trees illuminated by my headlights on the left side of the road.  The trees bordered the road there  but it was open meadow leading up to the pocket of trees.  In the center of the stand of trees I saw an orange light that I at first took to be a reflector on a pole or stick marking the road. As I got within twenty or thirty yards of the trees I seemed to notice movement and thought someone was walking in the trees and smoking a cigarette and I was seeing the  cherry  at the tip of the cigarette.  I still felt no cause for concern and remember thinking facetiously that it was one of the  Ophir Creek Campground Wackos  out for a four in the morning recon. I continued to drive up the road and watched the orange light fade as the lights no longer shined directly into the trees.  As we rolled by my son said  Dad?  in a questioning tone.  He had seen the orange light/reflection also and was pointing into the trees to the left.  I noticed a large rock in the periphery of my headlights and something standing behind the rock turning it  s head to follow the movement of my truck as we drove past the trees at the edge of the road.  It was probably ten to fifteen feet off the road.  I started to brake but something inside said don  t stop so I didn  t.  What I saw in those few moments was definitely humanoid or bipedal  whatever you want to call it.  It was standing perfectly erect  not slumped and was definitely watching my pickup and turning it  s head and upper body to keep my truck in sight.  The large rock hid the lower half of the body but I could see a vague outline of it  s torso (from about where the navel would be on a human being)  shoulders  and head as I passed.  I do not recall seeing any distinct outline of arms in the very brief time this happened.  I would say the whole incident took 15 to thirty seconds to transpire.  I drove on up the road watching my mirror but saw nothing in the red glow of my taillights.  I looked over at my son whose only comment was   did we just see what I think we saw?   I told him  yes  I think we did.   We drove on up to Blue Lakes and talked about what we had seen and then took a short nap (with the doors locked) waiting for daylight so we could set up camp.  Later that morning after daylight had come and we set up camp  we drove back down the road to the stand of trees and got out to look around.  The ground was covered in pine needles (except the road area and a creek bed about twenty of thirty yards away.)  We both stood by the large rock and realized the  creature  had to have been 7 to 7-1/2 feet tall because the top of the rock was at the level of our chests  (he and I are 5  10  tall).  We found one spot in the edge of the road where it appeared something had come down off the hillside on the right side of the road.  There were no distinct tracks in the packed gravel of the road  but there were two spots where small rocks (maybe thumbnail size) had been disturbed and pushed from the roadside toward the hillside (90 degrees from the direction of normal vehicle travel).  I took several photos of the stand of trees  the large rock  the marks on the roadside and an indistinct depression in the moist edge of the creek.  There was nothing that specifically proved it was a Bigfoot standing in those trees watching us drive by  but my son and I have no doubt that it was. ,I don  t recall the number of the forest service road  but if you drive west on S.H. 165 and go past Lake San Isabel  it goes to the left off the highway and then heads west and south back toward Greenhorn Mtn to the Blue Lakes.  This sighting took place shortly after the private Ophir Creek Campground which was also on the left side of the forest service road. ,Custer,8,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8027,yes
798,Shortly after the Reader  s Digest article which discussed the Patterson Film  my dad related something that had been told to him as a teenager in the late 1940s. At that time he was working as a fishing guide during summers at Monument Lake in Southeastern Colorado. In his spare time he used to  hang out  with an old Indian man and go hiking and hunting in the Sangre de Cristo Range. He said that on one occasion he indicated to the old man that he wanted to hike into a new area near Blanca Peak and the Indian said  no we can  t go there  because that is where the Sasquatch lives.  My dad had never heard of this  but given a brief description he said  oh  you mean a bear.  The Indian said  No  this animal walks like a man.  My dad chalked it up to superstition  but was surprised when the Patterson film was made public. I didn  t notice any other reports from this area so I thought I would send in this info. , ,Costilla,3,Colorado ,CO,Unknown ,8023,yes
799,In the first week of June  1994  my 2 sons and I were fishing in a beaver pond on the Lake Fork of the Conejos about 1 mile upstream from where the Lake Fork of the Conejos meets with the Conejos River. It was near sunset and the sun had already gone behind the mountains. There was a sparsly forested rise toward the southwest above the beaver pond we were fishing. Just beyond this rise was the south slope of a ridge of old growth forest. A horrible gravelly scream or yell of almost unbelievable volume came from just inside the forest at about 150 to 200 yards distance. I am an avid bowhunter of 20 years experience with all manner of big game and the sound was definitely not an elk or bear. Elk make some loud and unusual sounds but this sound was vastly different and many times louder. I noticed that a light breeze was blowing from us toward the source of the sound. If the creature had a good sense of smell  it was probably smelling us. Bowhunting experience has taught me that an elk would smell us under the same conditions. The sound had a threatening essence to it. The sound itself was kind of undescribable and seemed louder than a creature could possibly make. Whatever made the two tone scream must have one big set of lungs and a very large  megaphone size  mouth. The sound lasted about 1 or 2 seconds and was repeated three times  with a 10 or 15 second pause between each blast of noise. I was unarmed and decided since I had my sons with me I would give the creature its space. We left. I was somewhat alarmed  but would have gone to the source of the sound if I had not had my sons with me. I did go to the area of the source of the sound the next morning alone at sunrise to see if I could find tracks or other evidence of the source of the sound. I some very old large tracks in soft dirt on a flat area about 1/2 mile uphill. They were about 16  by 8  in size but too old to descern any toes or other detail and could have been bear tracks distorted and enlarged by rains and time. There was a line of about 20 of these large tracks in single file across the bare ground of this bench. Most of the rest of the soil in this area is too rocky to see the tracks of soft footed animals well. The tracks I found were at least a week or two old. I spent all morning looking the area over  hoping to find evidence  but hoping I didn  t find the creature itself. ,Conejos County  Colorado  on the Lake Fork of the Conejos River  near the San Juan Wilderness ,Conejos,8,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8021,no
800,A friend and I and my dog were hiking in the Loveland Pass of Colorado.  We parked on highway 6 where it crosses the continental Divide and hiked south along the divide for about five miles.  We meandered down into one of the valleys carved into the divide on the eastern side.  We were looking for pioneer artifacts from the many who passed through this area on the trek to California. We had descended below the tree line where the valley peteres out into a boggy meadow.  This meadow runs down to a stream to the immediate east.  The stream is large at this point and I think this is the same stream that can be seen from Interstate 70 at the Eisenhower tunnel several miles north at the Loveland ski resort.  Dense brush and tree cover run along the opposite bank. We began to hear what we thought were noises from a large animal across the stream.  We tried approaching the source of the noise  but as we moved closer the sound moved away downstream along the opposite bank.  I started catching glimpses of a large  hairy  brown and black animal and thought we were following a bear.  My friend had the same idea and our pace slowed to a halt.  The animal then moved a little closer to us and appeared to watch us for several seconds.  Its height made it look like a bear reared up on its hind legs.  It then turn and moved off downstream through the brush in a long  loping  two legged gate that would have been impossible for a bear.  We did not care to follow. Adding to my belief that what we saw was not a bear or other wild animal is the fact that my dog did not bark or show any of the aggressive excitement he usually displays upon encountering a wild animal.  He actually drove an adult black bear  which was pillaging garbage cans  out of a campground several years ago.  During our encounter in Loveland he only showed the polite interest he shows in people in the woods. , ,Clear Creek,1,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8019,yes
801,I was camping with my family at the headwaters of Clear Creek Reservoir near Granite Colorado. I was very young at the time.  I was with eight of my cousins and we decided to climb the hill at the north end of the reservoir to get a better view of the area. There were nine of us ranging in age from nine to 14 years old. When we reached the top of the hill we started rolling rocks down the hill. It was then that we noticed  right across the ravine from where we stood  a tremendous amount of crashing through the aspens. At first we thought it was a grizzly bear since it stood on its hind legs watching us from a distance of about 300 feet.  Its hair was golden brown in color and very long. It was very tall  at least eight feet. It just stood there on two legs looking straight at us. I could not see its face. The sun was at its back and its face was in silhouette. But  I could tell that the face was very dark. The head and body were large and were not built like a bear. We stood and watched this animal and it watched us for several minutes. It stood on two legs at all times and sometimes it rocked back and forth. At that time I assumed that this was because it wanted to get our scent or to get a better view. We then decided to run for it. We came down the hill at breakneck speed  and were scolded  by our parents who thought we could have broken a leg running so fast down the hill. My parents claimed it was a bear. But  I have been hunting and fishing these mountains for thirty years. I have never seen a grizzly bear in this part of the state. I have seen grizzly bears before and their fur is brown.  The color of the fur on this animal was unlike anything I have ever seen.   Again It was very long and golden in color.   To this day me and my cousins swear we saw a bigfoot. ,Travel South out of Leadville Colorado about fifteen miles on U.S. 24 to Granite Colorado.

802,I grew up in Boulder County  my parents quit farming in NE and moved to Longmont in 1960. During the summer  we would go up Big Thompson Canyon or the St. Vrain to camp and picnic. In the summer of 1964  we were picnicking along the St. Vrain stream. We had started a campfire  you could do that then  and while I was looking for wood  I felt like I was being stared at. I looked up  and at the top of a sheer rock wall about thirty feet up  I saw him. I can see him like yesterday. He was looking at me and as soon as I saw him he turned and left. He was very large probably eight feet tall and had long greying hair. His face was darker and did almost look human. No one believed me of course  but I can still see his eyes looking at me before he turned. So I have always believed in their existence. ,Bend in Hwy  small sand bar area into stream were we were picnicking  sheer rock wall on north side of stream. Tan colored and redish sandstone.

803,On Dec  20  2000  my wife and daughter were walking along (withheld) Road when they spotted two large footprints in the snow about five feet off the road a quarter mile from our cabin. Due to the size of the prints  at first they thought it was a bear. But as they got closer  they saw it was a huge foot similar to a man  s without shoes on. They came home insisting I come and look at this thing. I examined the print by placing my foot next to it. My shoe size is 10 1/2 and this print was five inches longer and double the width. I estimated it was 14 inches long with toes  and a slight curve in the arch area. It was left a mystery until today  s Denver Post arrived with an article on bigfoot displaying the same footprint we examined on Dec. 20. ,Withheld at witness request. ,Archuleta,3,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8007,yes
804,(Witness stated the incident occurred while he was with his mom  dad and uncle four-wheeling on the Como Road in the Sangre De Cristo Mountains in the San Luis Valley in Colorado on Sunday  August 20th  2000.) We had made it past Lake Como and to the end of the Jeep road  where we fished for a while and ate our lunch. When we left the last lake  it was about 1 30 p.m.  with my uncle and me in the lead on our four-wheelers. We had gone about a half a mile when my uncle and I spotted both something that looked like a dead  burned tree stump that was about 7 to 8 feet tall. We didn  t think to much of it until it moved. It stood upright and walked like a man. At first  we thought it was a hiker but it was all the same color  from head to toe. It walked about 15 yards before it walked into the trees. My uncle and both stopped to make sure we saw the same thing. But we drove down the road about 300 to 400 yards before we decided to go look for it. We walked into the trees about 200 yards and came to a small meadow. My uncle was looking the other way when at the other end of the meadow it ran through. I yelled   There it goes !. We took off after it  on foot. This time I got a little bit better chance to look at it. The creature was a light to a medium brown and had shaggy long hair  it stood about 7 feet tall. When we reached the end of the meadow  each of us went in an opposite direction. My uncle went the same direction as the bigfoot  and I went the other way in case it double-backed on us. But we didn  t see the creature after that. We did find a few footprints  but didn  t have any plaster to make a mold. So we went back down the mountain. I know what I saw that day and no one can tell us otherwise. ,From I-25 at Walsenberg  take U.S. 160 westbound. Turn right on Co. 150. Go about 2 miles and turn on what is called Lake Como Road.

805,It was Friday  January 25  2001.  At first I was not even going to go down to the area were I and a friend saw a bigfoot.  I was going to finish watching the Pagosa Basketball team play and go home. But a boxing match was on the same night and my best friend  s (not the friend that saw it with me) brother-in-law was going to buy it on Pay per View  and his brother-in-law lives in the area of Cromo and Edith  Colorado.  There are always some crazy sightings of UFO  s and Bigfoot sightings. I really didn  t believe in these type of things until I saw one for myself. We watched the boxing match and after it was over we started to head back to Pagosa Springs on Cromo Rd and we were almost to Highway 84 when about 20 yards in front of us this thing or big foot crossed and went quickly  almost as if we were seeing things. I didn  t know what to think  so I asked Sammy if he saw it  and he said  What was that?  We got up to where it crossed and I opened my door to look down on the road and saw a foot print and Sammy opened his door and saw a track too. We both freaked out and I drove as fast I could to Pagosa Springs. We didn  t tell that many people  only the ones that would believe us.  , ,Archuleta,3,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8007,yes
806,Two friends and I went camping in the San Juan National Forest just east of Lake Vallecito on 6-1-04. DC and I were from out of state but JG was a regular camper there. We went 12 miles up the forest service rd. and picked a campsite. We saw no one else that day and it was a dead-end road. JG said it was the first time he  d been there alone. We spent the day hiking around and cooking meat over the campfire. We did not see or hear anything unusual that day other than a partial horse skeleton. At about midnight  we were winding down when we heard three  2-tone howls to the hill approx. 1/4 mile to our north. We knew it was not a coyote but almost sounded like a person trying to imitate a coyote because it had a deeper bass tone. About five minutes later  we heard the same thing again. Then I heard something like a gunshot in the same area but there was no sonic crack. It was like something hit a tree really hard. Both sounds came from the same place as the first set of howls. We were all standing around the fire wondering what it was. JG had his shotgun in hand and we were all starting to get a little edgy. We all are police/former police/former military so it takes a lot to get any of us  edgy.  We all have camping experience and none of us had ever experienced anything like this before. About five minutes later  directly to our west  was a very loud 2-tone howl approx. 100 yds. away. It howled again and it was closer so it was closing in on us. DC and I drew our pistols and flashlights and all of us focused on the logging rd. that it/they would have to cross to get to us. There was a bright full moon so the open areas were well illuminated. It howled one more 2-tone howl before stopping at what we estimated to be 50 yds. away in the woodline. It seemed like it covered at least 50 yds. going through the woods while howling three times. Whatever it was was BIG and LOUD! There was a lot more bass to the howls than a dog/coyote/wolf has. Each time it howled it was 2-tone  in a series of three and it seemed unemotional or intelligent. About a minute later  another series of three 2-toned howls came from the hill to the south approx. 1/4 mile away. It seemed to be answering the one hiding in the treeline in front of us. Then the one in the treeline let out three more of the same howls. Let me stress again  this thing was LOUD! We were all pretty shaken. We felt that we had aroused at least three  big things that were communicating among themselves and closing in on us. We were all facing out from a dying fire with weapons and flashlights drawn. We didn  t know if we were being studied or they were getting in position for attack. We decided to leave. After some debate  we decided to pack the trucks while one of us took turns watching with flashlight and gun. A few minutes later we were packed and headed down the mountain to the main rd. We did not see or hear anything while packing or leaving. When we got to the road  we stopped to unload our guns and stow them legally in the trucks. There was one house close to the road and after a while the dogs started to bark. I joked to JG that  they  were coming after us. Just then  we heard another set of howls about a mile back the rd. we  d just come down. Whatever it was had followed us and we left immediately. We were not sure what it was that night but after talking about the incident quite a bit  we think we had a Bigfoot encounter. It was a remote  wooded  mountain location with a large lake over the hill. There were at least three intelligent beings communicating that sounded loud and large. We had been leaving our scent all around and had been cooking meat all day. No person would be crazy enough to risk getting shot playing a prank on us. The howls were very eerie. Like I said  they were all like the first 2-tones of a wolf howl but much deeper. There was no trailing off like a dog/coyote/wolf howl  just 2-tones. Each 2-tone howl was in a series of three howls that took approx. 5-6 seconds per series. The only thing missing from the encounter was the lack of the famous Bigfoot stench. There was no wind so maybe the thing in the treeline was far enough away for it not to reach us. We are not out to hoax anyone. We hope none of our colleagues find out so our day to day judgment is not questioned or ridiculed. This was the first time any of us had seen any of the other ones scared. We just felt that we had to share our experience for what its worth. ,The encounter took place above Beaver Meadow Spring in the San Juan National Forest east of Vallecito Reservoir.

807,I live in Denver  Colorado and I may have seen a bigfoot when I was in college in Boulder  Colorado several years ago. This occurred in November 1995. I was a freshman college student in Boulder  Colorado  and I used to like hiking in Chataqua Park nearby  which is higher than the rest of Boulder and faces the city. One night I was in Chataqua Park at about 11pm. It was cold and I was standing in my coat  looking down at the city lights. Suddenly  I heard a rustling sound and turned toward it. That  s when I saw a large figure that was silhouetted against the city lights. It looked like a very large  hairy  naked person with a powerful build  broad shoulders  and a relatively small  pointed or bullet-shaped head. It spotted me  which made me afraid of being attacked  but instead it began running toward the cover of the trees. Its running gait was unlike that of any person I had seen. It was a kind of hunched-over  loping gait. Nevertheless  the figure moved quickly and disappeared behind a tree. That was all I saw of the figure. I have always considered this a possible bigfoot sighting. ,The location was in Chataqua Park near the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder. To reach Chataqua Park  just drive west on Baseline Road from the CU Boulder campus. You will drive up a short but fairly steep hill  and the park will be on your left side and clearly labled. ,Boulder,3,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8013,yes
808,My friend had an elk tag for that area but I did not draw so I was just along for the ride. My friend took a strool up a very high ridge as I stayed in the bottom walking along the creek that split the saddle. As I made my way down the creek I noticed a strange single track in a patch of snow. The track was old as the snow was melting away its clarity but it strongly resembled that of a human print. It was extremely large  15  to 16  long  6  to 7  wide. I must have studied the track for an hour trying to make it out but it was very unclear. I did not see another track in the immediate area but I decided to show it to my friend anyway even though I started believing that it was just an act of nature. My friend was entrieved by the  track as he found more characteristics in the print than I did. He pointed out the toes which were very hard to see but when you looked hard they were there. They seemed to go straight across the top of the foot in a straight line but only three were visible. We then chatted about the track for a while and making excuses for what else it could be. We then decided to head back. We walked down the creek a little farther when we saw something we could not believe. About 100 yards from the original track were about six or seven additional tracks in snow and mud. These tracks were in much better condition. They had the same dimensions of the first track and appeared to be just as old. They were in a shaded area so they were some what preserved. Like the first track they only showed three toes but one track showed four and one showed five. The only explanation I had for the tracks being so far apart was that what ever made the tracks must have used the rocks along the creek to walk on. ,Incident occured in Chaffee County Colorado in an area known as Middle Fork  about 14 to 17 miles west of Salida off Hwy 50.  ,Chaffee,4,Colorado ,CO,Unknown ,8015,no
809,This incident occurred after my husband  myself and our 3 children and I had moved up to some land purchased on Sugar Loaf mountain west of Boulder. My husband managed a tavern at the time and had purchased the five-acre silver mining claim for a song from (name withheld) at the bar and on a paper napkin. We built a tiny 12 x 16   cabin and squeezed ourselves in there on the south side of the mountain about 2/3 of the way along the original little mining road. The cabin was on only level land on a heavily treed and rocked parcel. The north side of the cabin snugged right up against the mountain slope with pine trees all around. That side was two plywood sections high  which would have put it a hair over 16  . We had an over-sized plywood platform  bunk-bed  in the NE corner of the cabin with we adults and our baby daughter on the first level and the two boys on the upper level. We put in a little window up there for them for air and put an inside shutter on it so they could close it when it got really cold  which it sometimes did. It reached 40 below the first winter we were there. I think it was during the second  autumn there  so it would have been 1971  our then 5 1/2 yr old son claimed he heard the sound of footsteps in the early evening after hearing a really strange sound - definitely animal  but he had no words at that age to describe it. He said it sounded like a call of some sort and  bigger  than an owl (some kind of hooting???). Then he heard some noises close by - rustlings  etc. When he looked up through the open shutter window  - he said he looked right into the face of a  monster.  All I know for sure is that I  ll certainly never forget his terrified screams! When he calmed down  he described it as dark and very hairy and a  funny  face and glowing eyes; it turned and ran away as soon as he started screaming. His brother  two years older  slept through the incident until his brother  s shrieks woke us all. With the ground sharply slanted up  we figured something would have had to have been just about 7-8   tall to peer into that upper window. Not being trained trackers  we found no evidence the next day  but our son  who is now almost 35  swears to this day  that it was Bigfoot that he saw. And I have always believed him since there was no way in the world that  at his age  he could have made up that precise an auditory and visual image or his terror. He came over and visited us this morning. I told him about the article in the Post and he reiterated his story. He says the image has never left him and probably never will. ,Precise location withheld on request of witness. Location is near Sugar Loaf Mountain. ,Boulder,3,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8013,yes
810,I was driving south down from the mountain on my regular route I had my high beams on because its dark in that area. Its very rural when all of sudden a large up right dark figure stepped out into the road I stopped and watch it cross the road in three steps. This thing was so tall that it stood at least a foot and half above the rack on the roof of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. The legs were long and it bent at the knees like a human. All I seen was the side profile of it. It was very tall and from what I could see the head was large and long  the shoulder span was very wide. The side profile of the face was flat. It very quickly in three steps crossed the road.(its a wide two lane road). After it crossed I drove forward a little and tried to see where it went but couldn  t see it any more. This thing was frightening. I have been looking for it everytime I  m on my route but had not seen it again. On my other route which is on county road 306 about a 10min drive from this incident two days later there was a very strange strong smell in the area around 3am again. The smell was a very strong sweet burning rubber smell  I can  t describe it  I never smelled anything like it before. I smelled this for two days straight in this area and then it was gone. ,Driving west up trail west division off of county road 340 west of Buena Vista ,Chaffee,4,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8015,yes
811,We normally walk our dog off lead but entering the start of the hike  at the west entrance my wife and dog were immediately on high alert. My wife wanted our dog on lead as she was spooked.  After approx 1/4 mile I noticed  animal droppings that appeared large human shaped under the uphill undergrowth  spaced every 10-20ft.  I commented on the size and shape of the droppings with my wife and agreed they couldnâ€™t be human as there were too many and under the branches of the uphill side  We discussed how they appeared to be marking a territory. The droppings continued for maybe 150ft. We continue down/East on the trail.  At about the 1/2 mile marrk a deer startled us running from the uphill side across the trail and down the other side. My wife was spooked and we turned around to go back. As we neared the spot where the droppings were I spotted a  single foot print on the uphill side partly hidden by branches. I took pictures using my water bottle and shoe(size 10) for comparison. I wanted to spend more time but my wife and dog were very agitated. I spent 5 minutes searching for a rock or log or anything that would fit in the form of the print thinking it must have been a rock to have left such a deep  clear impression. No luck. We left in a hurry. ,The western side of the Railroad Grade Trail above Chalk Lake. CR 162 parallels the trail approx 300 ft below the trail. ,Chaffee,4,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8015,no
812,I saw with binoculars a group of three hikers and a dog making their way down the Lake Fork Trail toward the Lake Fork Ranch. They were walking at a fairly normal speed. What I would say to be 400 or 500 yards in front of them was a large  black object moving in the same direction--away from the hikers--at a much faster speed. It was not on the trail  but instead in the meadow next to the trail. It seemed as if it was spooked by the hikers. I  d say it was about a half mile from me  and 1000 or so feet downhill  so I couldn  t get a really good guage on how big it was. Although  judging its size against the hikers  it was clearly much larger than a man. There is no question that it was bipedal; not once did I see it move quadrapedally. This was definitely not a bear. As it appeared from my vantage point  I don  t think the hikers ever had a direct view of this thing. The clearing in which the hikers were was separated from the clearing across which it was running by a tongue of aspens growing down into the valley. I watched for about 5 minutes as it moved away from the hikers  eventually jumping Lake Fork and bearing farther away from the trail and disappearing into the trees on the southern edge of the valley. are there any other reports in this area? I  ve been going to the Conejos for about 25 years  and have never seen or heard of anything like this. ,Conejos County  Colorado...sighted on Lake Fork of the Conejos  on the Lake Fork foottrail  about half way between Big Lake and Rock Lake...sighting was made from the eastern branch of the Saddle Creek logging road...line-of-sight distance approx 2.5 miles SSE of Platoro  Colorado I was on the logging road  about 0.25 miles lateral and 1 000ft or so vertical distance from the Lake Fork trail when I made the sighting...we were standing on a rocky overlook next to the logging road which allowed a good view of the Lake Fork Valley  including Big Lake and Rock Lake ,Conejos,8,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8021,yes
813,REPORT OF A FIELD INVESTIGATION by Richard D. McCuistion  Sr.  Chilton Williamson  and Keith Foster  Between 4 and 7 August 1998 we began a long term study in a drainage thought to be the summer range of the Sasquatch(s) described by Foster in the Big Foot Research Organizationâ€™s geographical data base for Conejos County  Colorado.  Our purpose was to spend at least six days in the study area to establish our presence deep into  what we thought might be  the home range of the creature and to familiarize ourselves with the area.  Exact locations within Townships 35 and 36 North and Range 4 East will not be divulged here because of the areaâ€™s importance to us as a long term study area.  Also  it is not recommended that anyone  other than serious researchers who coordinate their activities in the area with us  venture into this area because of its remoteness and the unusual occurrences that we experienced. The study area is heavily timbered with slopes ranging from about 10% (6Â§) to over 100% (45Â§) and elevations ranging from 9400 feet above mean sea level (MSL) to over 12 000 feet above MSL.  The off road terrain is extremely rough and suitable campsites are almost nonexistent.  The soils are granitic  very firm  and not particularly conducive to animals with soft feet leaving discernible tracks -- shod horses weighing 1 000 pounds or more generally left slight hoof impressions in the surface of the dirt road.  The study area is summer range for an apparently sizable population of elk (Cervus elaphus).  The cow elk and their calves that I observed were numerous  well fed  and healthy.  I believe that this population serves as a prey base for the alleged resident sasquatch(es) as well as other large predators including man.  No evidence of bears was seen on this trip  but that does not preclude them from existing there. The first twenty-one hours spent in the study area by Williamson and me were uneventful.  We found a suitable campsite that had a fire ring and other evidence of recent human usage -- possibly by seasonal elk hunters.  The campsite lay between dense forest and rising terrain on the north-northwest  east and southeast sides and a large wet meadow that drains into the _________ Creek on the west side. The meadow covers an area of about 230 acres and is oriented on a northwest-southeast axis.  It was about 250 yards wide west-southwest of our campsite. At 16 00 MDT  5 August 1998  Williamson and I heard five distinct primate-like calls apparently originating from an 11 000 foot high ridge north of the campsite.  The vocalizations resembled those of a large man rising from a low pitch to a higher pitch before ending -- something like  Uuuuhhhhaaaa - Uuuuhhhhaaaa  and were similar to the vocalizations that I heard near Leadville during the early morning of 23 October 1994.  The vocalizations stopped before they could be recorded.  To our knowledge  no other humans were within four and a half miles of our campsite.  A possible hikerâ€™s camp was observed by us as we drove into the area the previous day. It was approximately four and a half miles southeast of our camp and was next to the access road and a pack trail leading up to _______Peak.  This camp was located at about 9400 feet above MSL and the intervening  rough  and heavily wooded terrain rose to over 11 000 feet above MSL.  By road  the distance between camps was greater than seven miles.  At about 16 30 MDT  we were joined by Keith Foster and his son Andrew.  We discussed the vocalizations and it was noted that our campsite was about ______ miles from the site of Fosterâ€™s scream encounter of June 1994. At about 01 40 MDT  6 August 1998  Williamson was awakened by an undetermined disturbance.  Since he had decided to keep his horses in their trailer that night  it may have been their movements in the trailer that awakened him.  At about 01 57 MDT  he heard a vocalization coming from nearby that sounded something like  Ahhhh - uuuhhhh  -- a diminutive  rhythmic  and almost conversational form of the vocalization heard the preceding afternoon.  Also  this vocalization was repeated several times and was followed by a pair of low  sharp clicks as if two hard objects or rocks were being struck together.  Foster also heard the clicks.  The vocalization seemed to emanate from a small ridge less than a quarter of a mile northeast of our campsite.  Unfortunately  Williamson was unable to awaken me sufficiently for me to corroborate his observations. After daybreak on 6 August  we observed several elk cows and their calves grazing on a bench about one half mile southwest and upslope of our campsite.  Several bulls were observed bedded down above the timberline on the east-northeast slopes of _______Peak.  After breakfast  we conducted a brief examination of the area north of our campsite  but nothing unusual was observed.  Foster and his son departed to examine the bait sites that he had established near the site of his scream encounter.  These bait sites were established in mid-July 1998 and were designed to collect hair samples and hand prints.  Williamson and I rode the horses further down the drainage following a closed logging road.  We rode about one and a half miles down-drainage before coming to the end of the closed road.  We found the road washed out and impassable by vehicle.  At the roadâ€™s end  we found a major game trail that continued down the_________Creek drainage  but we elected not to follow it because of the deadfall and snags which made going impossible for the horses.  While at this location  I took the opportunity to pound rhythmically on a hollow log with a large rock for about 30 minutes;  my effort  however  elicited no response.  We retraced our path to our campsite and rode beyond it to an old clear-cut.  The exact date of the cut is not known  but it shows up on the aerial photography taken on 29 August 1989 as a recently disturbed area.  This clearcut is now an open meadow with slopes of about 10% to 20% and is covered with a generous growth of grasses  sedges  and some pine saplings ten or twelve feet in height. Numerous cow and calf elk tracks  along with recently used beds  were observed throughout this area. At 18 03 MDT  6 August 1998  numerous and sustained primate-like screams or roars were heard by Williamson and me reverberating around our campsite. The direction from which the vocalizations emanated could not be determined  and the quality of the calls seemed to have a definite edge or harshness over the vocalizations heard the previous day.  They sounded something like  Rrrrraaaahhhh - Rrrrraaaahhhh! .  These vocalizations lasted for about four minutes and  again  I was unable to record them.  The horses were securely tethered to the rear of their trailer and we turned in for the night at about 22 30 MDT which coincided with the rising of a full moon. At about 02 00 MDT  7 August 1998  Williamson and I were awakened by Fosterâ€™s vehicle alarm system  which caused a few moments of pandemonium  and Foster shouting   False alarm! .  He then advised us of the events preceding the alarmâ€™s activation.  He stated that he had been awake when he began to hear a rhythmic rock-clacking 50 to 100 yards north of the campsite.  The sounds of two rocks being struck together began at about 01 40 MDT.  He described the sound as having a definite cadence of one strike per second and lasting for a period about twenty seconds.  He observed that the horses were fully alert   extremely nervous or frightened  stamping and snorting and both of them were trying to position the horse trailer between themselves and the source of the rock-clacking.  There were no slopes around the campsite steep enough for a dislodged rock to tumble down and duplicate the steady cadence that he heard.  Upon hearing the clacking and observing the fright exhibited by the horses  he attempted to lower the window of his sport utility vehicle in order to hear better  but inadvertently activated the alarm system which caused Williamson and me to respond to the emergency with weapons at the ready. The events leading up to the alarm were discussed  especially the horsesâ€™ exhibited behavior.  They are experienced mounts for deer and elk hunting and have been used on numerous such hunts to pack out downed game.  They have also been exposed to bear which  according to their owner  frighten them considerably.  Foster expressed the opinion that no further incidents would be forthcoming because of the noise made by the alarm and our activity and then he retired for the night.  Williamson and I decided to maintain a listening watch.  Within 45 minutes after activity in the camp subsided  the horses began to alert again and  with the aid of a sound amplifying device  Bionic Ear  stealthy  creeping footfalls could be heard.  Although the device had a directional parabola  there was enough spurious background noise from over-flying jet aircraft to make precise directional orientation difficult; still  the footfalls that I heard were definitely not the thudding noise made by the horses or other hoofed animals as they walk.  It became apparent that the horses were confirming what I was hearing and that they were giving us an accurate bearing on the intrusions.  The horses never alerted toward the meadow on our open west-southwest flank. To aid us in our surveillance  we also used a pair of night vision goggles  but despite a full moon and the unitâ€™s infrared spotlight  viewing into the shadows wasnâ€™t very productive because of the jumble created by branches and snags.  A four celled Mag-Lite was also used to pan suspected areas and at about 04 00 MDT red eye-shine was detected.  The eye-shine appeared as two parallel  reddish pinpoints which winked off and on at about the same visible plane as the base  and to the side of  a lone tree growing on the southwest rim of a small swale.  The swale began about 15 yards north of the horse trailer and was approximately 25 yards in diameter.  A person of average height standing in it would be unable to see over the rim and into our campsite.  The eye-shineâ€™s color was consistent with the red or orange reported by Grover Krantz ( Big Foot-Prints   1992)  while the color of the eye-shine cast by the horses was lime green.  Despite a full moon and clear meteorological conditions  no grazing elk or other nocturnal animals were observed at any time during the night.  (An absence of browsing deer and nocturnal animals was previously reported by me in my report of the alleged sasquatch screams and response calls that I heard near Leadville  CO in October 1994.)  The meteorological conditions then were basically the same as on the morning of 7 August 1998.  Moonset occurred at about 05 30 MDT. The intrusions occurred at intervals of one every 45 to 60 minutes and always began with the horses alerting in a different direction toward the forest around us.  Stealthy footfalls and movements would be detected and we would wait until we were absolutely sure that an animal was close by; then we would unzip the tentâ€™s insect netting and pan the suspected area with the night vision goggles or the Mag-Lite. An interesting  and I believe important  observation is of the horseâ€™s behavior preceding successive intrusions.  They were becoming more accepting of whatever was encroaching upon our campsite.  Bears are ruled out because they were not observed and the horses did not exhibit the fear reaction they are known to show in a their presence. After daybreak  the area around the campsite was examined for tracks and other disturbances.  The groundâ€™s surface was  as stated previously  very firm and fairly even  with a layer of pine needle duff under the trees and grasses and sedges in the open areas.  Rock outcrops occurred throughout  and the open areas were moist from a heavy dew and a light rain shower from the previous afternoon.  An animalâ€™s bed was found about 90 yards north of the campsite under a tree above the northern rim of the swale.  This position or bed provided an excellent  but screened  view of our campsite. The bed was dry and appeared fresh  and I did not observe any hoofprints or footprints in or around it although the soil and duff were disturbed.  There was no detectable odor in the bed.  Foster picked up two base-ball sized rocks and struck them together to demonstrate the sound he had heard earlier that morning.  The noise he produced startled the horses and elicited their undivided attention during the demonstration.  Conclusions  1.  Primate-like vocalizations were heard on three separate occasions between 5 and 7 August 1998.  The vocalizations heard in the afternoons of 5 and 6 August 1998 could not have been made by a human without the aid of a megaphone because of the dense forest and vegetation which quickly attenuated sound.  These vocalizations lasted for a period of not more than five minutes each occurrence and were definitely produced by a living animal and not by a tape player.  The vocalizations heard on 5 August had  as interpreted by Williamson  a  Heads up or general announcement  quality to them  whereas those vocalizations heard on 6 August were more like  Now hear this! .  The vocalization heard during the early morning of 6 August had a conversational quality to it and was followed by a pair of low  sharp clicks which were also heard by Foster. 2. The footfalls and movements heard with the Bionic Ear were consistent with the night movement techniques that I learned during my training as a combat infantryman.  The technique was  basically  to place the toe of your boot carefully but firmly  avoiding branches  twigs  or dry leaves  and then gradually shift your weight to that foot so as to minimize the sound of vegetation being crushed or soil being shifted.  It is apparent to me now that the tentâ€™s zipper broadcast our alertness and the panning spotlight confirmed it. 3.  The horses that we had with us were  initially  invaluable as an early warning system  but they seemed to become accepting of whatever it was that kept encroaching upon our campsite.  It appeared to their owner that they were beginning to show the same interest in the intruder(s) as they did when one of us approached them. 4.  We were not subjected to the same sort of intimidation or threat displays  such as screams  and thrashing of vegetation that others have reported in their sasquatch encounters.  This difference in behavior could have been due to our numbers and the nature of our presence in the area.  We all carried firearms  we actively scouted the area  we made drumming noises on a hollow log  we didnâ€™t hunt the elk that abounded the area  and we remained vigilant during the night. 5.  Williamson and I had the distinct impression that we were dealing with an adversary rather than a curious and semi-intelligent animal. My conclusion is based on my personal instincts and experience as a former Marine who has seen some combat and Williamsonâ€™s was based on his  gut feeling  as he had no previous experience with anything like this.  We independently noted the change in the quality of the afternoon vocalizations between 5 August and 6 August  the use of non-verbal communication in the form of rock-clacking  and the repeated probing of our campsite on the morning of 7 August 1998.  The rock-clacking could be interpreted as a form of close range communication intended to mimic naturally occurring sounds which would not tend to alert a quarry.  According to Foster  such communication is sometimes used by bow hunters when hunting Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and Mountain Goats (Oreamnos americanus) because they tend to disregard the sound of falling rock 6.  The probing of a position is a complex  aggressive  and hostile act that is used to determine the strengths and weaknesses of an adversary. It is my opinion that the use of this device could only be made by an intelligent  sentient being or beings of potentially dangerous capability or intent.  Although there are no recently documented incidents of anyone being attacked by a sasquatch(es)  the above described occurrences  the Ape Canyon incident described by John Green ( On The Track of the Sasquatch   1980)  and the reference to chimpanzee hunting behavior described by Jane Goodall ( The Chimpanzees of Gombe  Patterns of Behavior   1986) caused my personal warning flags to go up.  Keith Fosterâ€™s  gut feeling  was that the encroachments on our campsite amounted to nothing more than simple curiosity. 7.  After considering all of the events leading up to the night of 6-7 August  Williamson and I decided to cut short our planned stay and to leave when Foster and his son left for their home in Kansas.  It was clear to us that our campsite could not be defended because of the surrounding terrain and forest and we did not want to test the intruderâ€™s intelligence and tactical ability with just two people and a pair of increasingly relaxed  horses.  If we had  indeed  been probed the night before  we were obviously under constant surveillance and it would have been readily apparent to an intelligent being(s) that it had the advantage. 8. Although no conclusive evidence was found that would support a claim that our campsite had been visited or probed by a sasquatch(es)  the area warrants further  and careful   investigation which we intend to   systematically  accomplish. , ,Conejos,8,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8021,no
814,We were on Highway 17 in southern Colorado  heading south through the Rio Grande National Forest toward Chama  NM. As we neared the border  Highway 17 began snaking up a five mile grade beginning at the Conejos River and cresting at La Manga Pass (10 230ft). Midway up the grade  we pulled off at a turnout to take a break and survey the surrounding forests  enjoying the view the elevation afforded us. The morning was quite brisk and one of the individuals in our party let out a  whoop  as we exited our vehicles. Soon after the echoes of the  whoop  had faded into the distance  we heard what sounded like a very loud roar (made by some type of nearby  animal )  unlike anything I  d ever heard before  that lasted for several seconds. Following a short pause there was another roar  then a pause  and then a final roar. The  roar  can best be described as being almost exactly that (sound  duration  pausing) which is currently found on this website  listed as a potential Bigfoot  howl  recorded in Ohio. In fact  listening to the  howl  and noting the distinct similarities to the  roar   is what prompted me to submit this report. In the silence following the final roar  I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand on end and uttered the only thing that came to mind at that point. Namely   What the hell was that?  And  needless to say  I apparently wasn  t alone in my thoughts as  with minimal discussion  our group quickly departed. In retrospect  even though we were seemingly alone on the grade  someone could have been playing tricks on us. Whatever  whether it was someone or something  the  whoop  issued by a person in our party is seemingly what precipitated the sounds we heard. ,Highway 17...Rio Grande National Forest...midway up the grade rising from a small bridge over the Conejos River to La Manga Pass. ,Conejos,8,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8021,no
815,Preface   The following is an excerpt from a true story my brother wrote several years ago for a hunting magazine.  Iâ€™ve edited it down to just the relevant portion of the story where he has an encounter withâ€¦something. ************************************ â€¦.sliding on my wallet with boot heels braking  I claw to a halt beside a dense stand of willows. Parting the foliage  I see the bull is mine at last.    Snapping a few quick photos  Iâ€™m hoping to slide the his sizeable mass down to a creek side flat for field dressing  but wedged in the tangle  itâ€™s a case of too much elk and not enough meâ€¦ â€¦Nightfall has now engulfed the landscape.  Stepping aside  by Braille I grope through my pack for a flashlight.  Successful  I turn its beam across the downed elk  only to be startled by the sounds of a heavy animal scrambling uphill from beside the carcass.   While my adrenal glands havenâ€™t exactly been on vacation this evening  all sensory gauges are now pegged.   It appears Iâ€™m not the only one who has followed the blood trail. Shouting threats into the darkness  Iâ€™m hoping to make it clear to this interloper exactly who this elk meat belongs to. How could an animal come so close without detecting the feared human scent?   Having my share of bear-in-camp encounters  Iâ€™m confident that this creature will  as others always have  amble off in search of easier pickings.  Standing in the blackness of heavy canopy  I hear the crunching leaves from circling footfalls that tell me this time might be different.   Looking at my bow and one remaining arrow  I feel like Iâ€™m on safari with the proverbial switch.  I briefly consider building a fire to keep the animal at bay  but as I scan the surroundings I find only fresh aspen growth upon a hillside too steep to support a fire. While Iâ€™m generally a stickler for prompt field dressing  Iâ€™m hesitant to make myself vulnerable by turning my back to the night â€“ and whatever is out there watching me. Sunrise is eight hours away and I know that if this continues much longer  my flashlightâ€™s batteries will begin to fade.   While pondering my dilemma  I hear footsteps and trickling beads of gravel dancing down the face of a rocky overhang directly behind me. Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m up against  but something tells me itâ€™s time to back away and leave the elk to whatever it is thatâ€™s skulking in the darkness.   Scanning for eye-shine with my failing flashlight  I descend the mountain  tying surveyorâ€™s tape to aspen limbs to help me retrace my steps in the morning  and begin following the creek back to camp.   Moments into the journey I stop and cock an ear into the night. Fifteen yards into dense willows  I again detect footfalls  seemingly paralleling me.   I shouting once more.   Iâ€™m weary of all this  and not equipped to do anything other than continue on. Itâ€™s a long  mentally exhausting hike back to camp.  As soon as I get there I reach under a nearby log and feel the cold steel of my stashed .38.   Gazing to the stars  I reflect upon my night.   Unbelievably  I again hear the pacing of heavy footsteps on the wooded flat rising behind camp.   The pistol is an enormous confidence builder  and wanting to get to the bottom of this  I rush the bench only to hear heavy footsteps dash off through breaking brush.   Now  to have an animal come to a carcass is understandable  but why in the world would it pass up a freshly killed elk to follow me back to camp? Sleep is not going to come easy tonight. Even in the darkest woods  Iâ€™ve always been comfortable; itâ€™s just the same beautiful forest with the lights turned off  right? But tonight  Iâ€™m truly unnerved.  Contemplating the 4-mile journey to the security of the Jeep  I realize - whatever it is - itâ€™s still out there. After wrestling the elk  Iâ€™m sure I smell like one. Slipping into fresh clothes  I have a seat in a large clearing and scan the surroundings.  As meteors race across the moonless sky all seems calm  and soon my sleeping bag beckons. At first light I eat a quick breakfast and head out  fully expecting to find my bull the subject of somebodyâ€™s midnight snack.   An hour later  Iâ€™m ascending to the site. A metallic clang of the .38-barrel striking a Sierra Cup announces my approach to any lingering scavengers. Cautiously advancing  Iâ€™m amazed to find my bull intact. Hmmmâ€¦ why then  was I followed? â€¦  â€¦One question remains   Why was I pressed off the downed bull â€“ then apparently followed back to camp?   Having stood my ground for some time  did the animal and I experience synchronized cowardice  mutually backing away  only to cross paths enroute to camp?   Maybe.   Or  was I intentionally followed?   And  if so  what were its motives?.... , ,Conejos,8,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8021,yes
816,The following is a report of unusual noises.  First  I would like to qualify myself as a competent woodsman...certainly no 19th century mountain man  but one who knows his way around the outdoors.  I was camping in the Rio Grande National Forest in Conejos County Colorado in September of 2005.  For those famaliar with this geographical area  I was in a district of the forest known locally and on topo maps as   Jacob  s Hill.    I have hunted and camped in this area for many many years.  It was in late September and I was sitting in front of my campfire around 9 pm when I heard the most bone chilling and indescribable wailing roar that I have ever heard.  It was a very throaty sound and could best be described as an animal in agony.  While I have never heard a mountain lion roar in person I have heard this and other  cat  noises on T.V. and this did not sound at all like those noises.  The closest thing I could relate it to would be the noise of a hereford bull bellowing....but it was not that either.  The sound continued uninterrupted for about 5-10 seconds and then ceased.  Immediately coyotes from several different locales in the vicinity began howling and yelping as tho very disturbed.  I did not hear the noise again during that particular outing. Now  fast forward 2 months into November in camp in the same location for the elk hunting season. Bear in mind that until this moment in November I had not mentioned this incident to anyone.  I awoke at 4 AM one cold morning and noticed that someone else was awake and had built our camp fire again.  Because I was going to get up in another hour or so anyway  I got up and stepped outside.  It was my brother prowling around and I asked why he was up so early.  He replied that he had gotten up to go to the bathroom and the weirdest thing had happened.  I interrupted him immediately and told that before he told me what had happened I wanted to tell him about my experience.  I related to him the very story I told above.  When I was finished my brother just looked at me in amazement and said that is exactly what he had just experienced verbatim; right down to the coyotes reacting.  He  like me  could not relate the sound to anything we had ever seen or heard. ,[GPS coordinates were supplied  and are shown in the internal database  but have been removed by the Editor from the public version of the report.] ,Conejos,8,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8021,no
817,Let me begin this with a brief bit of information about the area.  The South San Juan Wilderness (in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado) is considered to be Coloradoâ€™s wildest corner.  It was in the backcountry of this wilderness in the fall of either 1977 or 1979 (I forget which) that a sow Grizzly Bear was startled and attacked a bow hunter.  He was mauled but managed to kill the bear with an arrow he repeatedly drove into the bearâ€™s chest.  It was thought that the Grizzly had long been extirpated from all of Colorado.  If there are Grizzlies still in Colorado  this is where they are thought to be. I have been hiking  backpacking  camping  and fly-fishing in this area for about six years now  making about 2-3 trips per spring/summer/fall and one of those trips usually includes a backpack into the backcountry.  I am very familiar with the sounds the various animals make in the forests and mountains of the west and of this specific area. On this trip I managed to sneak away for a three day weekend in mid-June with the new lab.  I heard that the Salmon-fly hatch had started and wanted to try to get a piece of the action fly-fishing for big  aggressive trout. I figured I would save myself a few dollars by not camping in the developed Forest Service campsites and enjoy some solitude at the same time.  So I camped in a large series of meadows known as the Trail Creek Primitive Camping area; no water  no services  just camp where you will.  I was about 15 miles from the tiny community of Platoro at the upper end of the Conejos valley and maybe 10-15 miles from the next nearest community of assorted vacation houses known as Rocky Mountain Estates back down the valley.  I did not realize it at the time but this was a remote area even though the dirt road that ran up and down the valley was only about a Â½ mile across the meadows from my camping spot.  Behind me by about 50 yards was the edge of a 150â€™ moderate canyon of the upper section of the Pinnacles run of the Conejos River.  On the other side of the canyon  which is steep but easily crossed by humans  is a huge  expansive mountainside of aspen groves  spruce and fir trees  and mountain meadows.  This is the beginning edge of the South San Juan Wilderness Area. The second evening I had cooked dinner and taken the lab out for a last evening walk around the meadows.  It had been a good day of fishing and we were both tired.  We went to bed in the tent just at dark.  It was a night of an almost full moon.  We both fell asleep quickly. A bit later I awoke and thought I head something outside the tent  probably a deer.  But because I was curious I sat awake for a bit and listened.  After about 10 minutes from out of nowhere I heard this unreal  LOUD  clear  resonant  scream/screech/howl/roar type sound from not too far away.  It sounded maybe 300-400 yards away and like it might have been just across the canyon on the mountainside.  It was like no sound I have ever heard in my life.  It was fairly high-pitched and did not have the rough  gravelly sound that cats have when they roar and call.  It was clear  even crisp  loud  and lasted for about 5-6 seconds.  It seemed to be two parts screaming howl and one part roar  as it had that deep quality but was still high-pitched.  I sat there for a minute stunned  and then realized what it must be. I have read accounts on this website before about the sounds these creatures supposedly make  and this was what came to mind.  (So I guess chance does favor the prepared mind.)  And it was not that far away.  The sound seemed to be coming directly toward me  like it might have been screaming at or towards me or this meadow area where people sometimes camp.  It felt territorial  aggressive  even a little threatening.  Even though I had a .357 loaded with hot hollow points and a strong flashlight  the prospect of encountering some big  hairy â€œman-thingâ€ outside my tent in the middle of the night  in the middle of nowhere  and alone  was a little more than I wanted to deal with.  I got the dog in the truck and got the hell out of there  with the .357 in my lap.  After a few minutes on the way back down the valley toward an area where I could sleep in peace I sort of had a delayed reaction.  I became unnerved and thought that if I actually see one of these things in the headlights or on the side of the road next to my truck as I passed it I might really lose it.  I was that rattled.  I have lived and backpacked extensively in Montana and in the Canadian Rockies and dealt with the reality of Grizzly bears with no real problem.  But this noise and the creature that most likely made it really freaked me out. After sleeping in the car in the nearest little town of Antonito (I could not find any lodging at 11 30 at night) I went back a little after daybreak to look around and to get ready for another day of fishing.  I ate a cautious breakfast and kept looking around  worried I might actually see one of these things.  But in the daylight I was not quite as unnerved.  I did not find any tracks in the greater area in which I was camping as it was mostly grass  although I did walk around and search for a bit. When I got home I went online and listened to recordings of Mountain Lions and Bobcats  although I know these sounds and have actually seen a Mountain Lion up close in the wild.  The sound was definitely not one of these.  But when I went to this website and listened to some of the recordings I realized it had to be one of these creatures.  This sound was a bit higher in pitch than some of the other recordings  but VERY similar in most other respects. Now I am paranoid and worry that I might not be doing any more backpacking in this beautiful and remote area for fear of running into one of these spooky creatures  especially at night. ,I was in the Trail Creek Primitive Camping Area  just off of FR 250  about 30(?) miles up the Conejos Valley from the turnoff at Horca  CO. ,Conejos,8,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8021,no
818,in early june of this year i was riding my four wheeler above jasper colorado   at about 7;00 in the morning  i had stopped to rest at the logging block  when i heard a loud howling noise. there was no wind that day  and i could not focus in on the source. i had seen alot of sheep on Cornwall mountain on the way up so i figured it was a dog  or the sheep hearder  when i had finished my water i was loading everthing back on the bike when i heard the same sound again  only this time it was much louder. i zeroed in on it and my heart stopped. slightly below my logging road and to my right i observed a very large dirty black man like creature with his hands around an aspen tree it was leaning a little to the right and staring at me. i stood very still and never took my eyes off of it.after about seven or eight minutes it turned and simply walked off down the hill.i will add that i am a 30 year archery hunter  and have succesfully tagged bears in this same unit. this was no bear. it was large and shaggy looking. ,mount cornwall  right at the treeline ,Conejos,8,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8021,no
819,i was looking through binoculars scanning for elk and saw what i thought was a man walking down the path on the mountain .  Thought it was unusual he didn  t have on any hunter orange on.  It then turned sideways and I noticed it was bigger than a normal man walking with a long gate and was brown  almost the color of elk fur  was walking on two feet rather fast.  It walked to the ridge and looked over valley   then walked up same path it came in.

821,The witness  a 32-year-old software engineer  was rock hounding on Forest Road 320 in Long Hollow (2 miles off Rampart Range Rd about 5 miles south of Devil  s Head) in Douglas County  Colorado between 6 and 7 am when the incident occurred.  I had been working site looking for rocks for about 45 min.  I was about 100 feet south from my car  which was out of sight around the outcrop. When I was walked back to my car  I saw the windshield wipers were flipped over  rubber side out. As soon as I saw this  I began looking around  scanning the tree line (about 40 feet away from where the car was parked). Just inside the woods   I saw what I thought was the silhouette of a black bear looking at me.  I walked slowly (15 or 20 feet to my car) to the drivers side of my car watching the  bear  in the woods. It was about 20 feet in the woods watching and the car was between us. I got in my car  still watching the  bear  in the woods.  As soon as I slammed the car door it stood up. That was when I realized it was not a bear.  It ran south  still in the trees  and over the top of the quartz outcrop/mound. I saw it running for about 3 seconds before it was over the top of the mound. It took it about 6 seconds for it to move from sitting/crouching to out of sight. I started the car and drove away quickly and didn  t stop untill the McDonalds in Woodland Park where I flipped the windshield wipers over. The total time watching was about 2 min  from the first sight of the  bear  in the woods untill he was over the top  out of sight. Description  It was in the shadows of the trees and must have been sitting or crouched down  as I thought it was  a black bear standing on all fours. I could see a black mass which did not move as I watched it. When I slammed the car door it stood up about 7-8 feet tall (it looked like a large  dark man covered in black fur) I started my car as soon as it got up and did not watch it continuously as it ran  but did see it for about three seconds. Thinking back  it just seemed curious but at the time it didn  t feel that way.  ,Starting in Colorado Springs  go west on I-24 to Woodland Park.

822,I work at Arrowhead Golfcourse in Roxborough  Colorado.  Me and two other of my co-workers were going around getting all of the flags at the end of the night.  As we were going around the corner for hole 13 (it backs up to Roxborough State Park)  out of the corner of our eyes we saw this huge whitish grey figure that was clearly distinguished as a large human like figure.  Maybe about 7-8 feet tall.  Then we went around the corner before realizing what we had seen.  We sat for a second and I questioned my friend as to if he had just seen something as well.  The answer was  yes  and we turned around to go back to where we had seen it.  When going around the corner my two friends had seen it again. unfortunatley I missed the second sighting.  Acording to my friend the  figure  had peeked its head around the corner and stared at them.  They claim to have seen a  shoulder  move and then started screaming.  Once they started screaming the  figure  moved and was out of sight.  We put the golfcart into reverse and drove out of that area as fast as possible.  We went up to the cart barn and got a cart that was fully enclosed that had front headlights and went back to hole 13.  As we got there we stopped around the corner (just before the point in which my friends saw the shoulder move) to see if we could find footprints or anything out of the ordinary.  As we sat there  we started hearing very strange creaking noises that came from the back and to the left of us.  We stood there listening to this sound  for about 5-10 seconds and nobody was moving because we were all scared to death.  We left the area quickly.  The next couple days we attempted to look for  it  again and haven  t seen anything since. ,Rampart Range Road to Arrowhead Golfcourse in Roxborough Park.

823,My girlfriend and I were hiking the Lake Charles Trail in the Holy Cross Wilderness area.  We had hiked approximately 3 hrs/6 miles when we reached a basin which included 2-3 small lakes.  Upon reaching the basin area (a clearing) after climbing a steep switchback  we immediately heard what sounded like a loud scream coming from approximately 50-75 yards away in a dense pine cluster at the base of a mountain.  The sound grew louder as the animal was moving in a diagonal to us through the pine cluster somewhat towards us.  The vocalization now sounded like a large man wailing or moaning in a loud  rhythmic pattern.  The vocalization would last for 2-3 seconds then pause for 4-5 seconds then start up again.  This went on for 2-3 minutes.  I am an avid hiker and outdoorsman and am familiar with animal vocalizations including bear  elk  coyote  and mountain lion.  I can say that what we heard was not an ordinary animal.  I had with me two dobermans that have a tendency to chase a moving animal however  on this occasion  they were motionless showing a curious stance and looking in the direction of the sound.  As the sound grew louder  I became extremely frightened due to the volume and unknown nature.  I leashed the dogs and reached for my pepper spray as the sound moved towards us.  I cannot emphasize enough the rhythmic nature of this call and sheer volume.    The vocalization eventually stopped and we continued our hike.  5 minutes later  we passed a White River Forest Ranger   Lisa   who we questioned regarding the vocalization.  She had heard it also and stated that in her years of service  she has never heard a sound like that before.  She had no idea what it was. ,From Eagle  CO  take Brush Creek Road south to East Brush Creek Road(415)to the Fulford Cave/Lake Charles Trailhead.

824,I lived in Colorado for 29 years. Eighteen of those I spent working at ski resorts. Over the years I  ve seen hundreds of deer and elk as well as dozens of bear  everything from cubs to large 400 pound males. In the last 4 years I  ve had 3 separate sightings of 4 creatures that I hesitate to identify. My third sighting occured in November 2001 between Vail and Eagle. I was driving west on I-70 with my girlfriend who was sound asleep next to me. It was around 10 p.m.  a day or two after the full moon. It began to snow very hard  almost whiteout conditions at times. Somewhere after Vail and before Eagle the snow stopped for a few minutes. Even though it was night  it was very bright out due to the large moon and all the fresh snow. As I rounded a long curve in the highway my headlights hit two figures walking in the middle of the Colorado River. My first thought was   Oh no  these people have wrecked in the river and they  re trying to cross back to the highway.  I started to pull my Jeep to the side of the road and when I got even with them I saw two fuzzy looking people with very long arms walking down river. I could only see them from the knees up but it was obvious they were human in shape  upright  with elbows and knees. I stopped the car pretty quickly just past them and put on my emergency flashers. There was no break in the snowbank on the side of the road so obviously there was no wreck. With my girlfriend still asleep  I got out and stood on the edge of the bank looking up river for the two figures. It was maybe 20 degrees out and when they didn  t round the bend I figured I  d back the car up to them. As soon as I put my reverse lights on a semi-truck came around the corner and almost hit us  so I parked again and sat there for a couple of minutes. I had a camera with a flash. I figured I might get a picture since it was so bright out. But I couldn  t bring myself to wake my girlfriend up to tell her I was going to run back up the highway to take a picture of Mr. and Mrs. Bigfoot and I wasn  t about to leave her there sound asleep on the side of a snow covered highway. So when it began to snow again I put the car in gear and just drove home. Of my three sightings I find the third one the most compelling. I suppose someone in costume could have fooled me on the first two sightings. However  someone in costume walking in the middle of the Eagle River at night probably wouldn  t survive very long.  ,Sighting occurred off I-70 between Minturn and Edwards. ,Eagle,6,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8037,yes
825,I was 17 and on a back packing trip with my family in Grizzly Creek canyon. It was night and we were sitting around the campfire talking.  Suddenly a foul smell came into the camp site. Smelled like a combination of rotten meat  body odor and musk.  Our dogs went crazy barking and growling staring past our campfire behind the tent.  We could not see anything.  Suddenly we heard extremely loud  and extremley close vocalizations coming from just outside the ring of light made by our fire.  The sound was unlike anything we have heard before.  It was NOT a mountain lion or an elk.  It is hard to describe the sound. It was gutteral and it undulated sounding like something was strangling a goat.  It vocalized 2 or 3 times each time the sound started slow and then built in intensity.  My dad grabbed his gun but didn  t fire.  After a few more minutes the smell disapated and the dogs calmed down.  I have never been more frightened in my life  and remember wondering if I would live through the night.  The next morning we expolored the area where we felt the sounds were coming from.  There was an area of smashed grass behind a large boulder approximately 15 -20 ft from our tent but nothing else significant. ,This is near the Dotsero exit from I-70 past Coffee Pot Springs on the road to Deep Lake. ,Eagle,6,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8037,no
826,Monday August 31 2009 was the 3rd day of Coloradoâ€™s archery elk season.  The day before I was hunting a familiar ridge and noticed a remote looking hanging valley across from the ridge I was hunting and decided that if I didnâ€™t get into any elk that afternoon I would try to get into the hanging valley early the next morning. Monday morning I started out before light. By 6 30 I was climbing up a steep elk trail through a patch of very thick forest. I remember thinking that I had never been in this area before despite the fact that I had hunted this unit for over a decade and that this patch of forest was as close to â€œold growthâ€ as I had ever seen in central Colorado. I climbed onto a flat swampy and very lush area filled with thickets of brush. I started to feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck and I was sure that I had found the spot where I would have an opportunity at a bull. I could see a fairly large clearing just past the brush with a large wallow in the middle. I set up behind a thicket with a clear shot into the clearing  knocked an arrow set down the bow and blew on the hyper hot cow call 3 times. Immediately I heard him coming in from about 100 yards away but not from the direction I expected. He was coming in from just to the left of where I had just walked through. I was surprised he wasnâ€™t catching my scent. I could here him coming in very quickly through some very thick timber just past the clearing. I had my bow ready and I could see shadows move as he approached but I couldnâ€™t make out an elk. He stopped in the timber just outside the clearing at 30 yards and then it got super quiet. I didnâ€™t want to move a muscle so I just sat there motionless for 5 minutes and then blew the cow call again  nothing but silence. I waited another 5 minutes and decided he had blown my cover and left silently. I noticed it was 7 15. I got up and walked over to the wallow and I remember thinking that I had never seen an elk wallow look anything like this before. It looked like a tub made by man. It was perfectly rectangular  about 10 feet long and 4 feet wide and about a foot deep and appeared that the mud had been scooped out by hand. The water was perfectly clear so I knew nothing had used it recently. I admired it for a minute and then started hunting up through this hanging valley. I hunted all day up through the valley and to the top of the mountain without seeing any elk or much fresh sign. I started down the mountain thinking I really wanted to find that wallow again not so much to hunt today but to have a better sense of how to find it in the future.  At about 4 00 I knew I was getting close but I was exhausted from battling the timber all day. Then I stumbled upon another wallow that was also very strange. This one was round and about 7-8 feet in diameter  quite deep with the mud walls scooped up like a mini volcano cone. I remember getting a very weird feeling while looking at this wallow. How could an elk roll in the mud and create this perfectly round hole in the ground? This one had been used very recently because the water was very muddy and there was fresh mud all over the surrounding brush and trees. I started waking down the hill towards the first wallow and realized I was on a heavily traveled game trail  I followed it down the hill about 300 yards and it dropped me into the clearing from the morning. I walked over to the first wallow once again admiring how handmade it looked. I took one step away from the wallow towards the direction that I had entered the area that morning and started to hear a knocking sound. At first I really didnâ€™t pay attention but then I realized that it wasnâ€™t timed with the breeze and not consistent. I stopped the sound stopped. I took a step and knock  knock. I took a couple more steps and knock  knock  and knock much louder. Ok now the hairs are standing up on my neck as I realize the knocking is directly timed with my movements. The sound is coming from inside the swampy thicket area about 60 yards from the edge of the clearing. I get to the edge and stop the sound stops. I take a step to the right and knock  knock. A few steps to the left and knock  knock  knock very loud this time. So know I think there must be a bow hunter in a tree stand in there who is messing with me and Iâ€™m starting to get mad. I decide to take off my backpack and sneak in there where the knocks are coming from as quietly as a seasoned bow hunter can. I notice that as soon as I enter the brush I no longer hear any knocking. I keep sneaking in and finally get to where the sound was coming from and nothing. I search the area high and low looking in every tree for a tree stand and nothing. Now Iâ€™m really mad and go crashing out of there the way I came in. I get back to the clearing and swing my pack onto my back and knock  knock  knock  knock very hard coming from right where I was just standing a couple of minutes ago. Now Iâ€™m totally freaked out. I grab my binoculars and start glassing through the brush and timber looking for a window that I could see through. I take a couple steps to my right while looking through the binoculars and I see a log swing through the air and hit a dead tree  Knock. I quickly try to focus on the spot when it comes into focus in a small sight window through the brush. I can see a large grayish black hairy figure  I see its torso  arm  shoulder  elbow and hand clutching a log about 4â€ in diameter and smacking it against a dead tree  knock  knock. I move to try and get a better look but it moves from the window but as it does I distinctly see its movement. It was a very human like move as it turned I could see it turn at the hips while its arm swung in time with the movement just like a person would look while walking and turning 90 degrees. Realize I am looking through binoculars at 60 yards so all of this is crystal clear. It was totally covered with hair about 3 to 4 inches long and appeared to be matted with mud. I judge that its elbow was at least 5 feet off the ground. Almost going into complete panic now I start running the other way. I only take a few steps and force myself to calm down. I tell myself that if that animal wanted to harm me it would have already done it. So I start walking diagonally away from it in a direction that will get me off of this shelf. The knocking continues intermittently as I put yards between us  when I get about 150 yards away I hear what I can only describe as the sound of a log flying through the air crashing through the brush and hitting the ground with a thud at about 50 yards from me. I never heard any more sound but as I worked my way down through the dark timber I found myself on a heavy game trail and I came on a switch back where a tree had fallen or been pushed over. As I approached I could see and smell this rancid black liquid on the ground where the tree used to stand. I can only describe it as a huge puddle of pitch black diarrhea buzzing with flies. There did not appear to be anything in it like chokecherry seeds or hair or bone that you would associate with bear shit. I see lots of bear sign and this certainly didnâ€™t appear to be bear. I got off of that slope as quickly as possible without further incident. It was an hour and a half back to camp. I arrived in camp disappointed to find that all 3 of my hunting partners had already left. It was a long semi sleepless night in the tent with my pistol by my side but uneventful.

827,My wife and myself and another couple were traveling west on I-70 roughly the 135 mile marker. The Colorado River is very visible to your left side only 50 yards away. The temperature was 10 degrees. It was about 5 pm  still plenty of daylight. We were all enjoying viewing the Colorado River when we all four noticed something tall thin and hairy walking in the middle of the river. It was slightly leaning forward and its arms were swinging. We just saw it for a few seconds  as we were traveling at highway speeds. We commented to each other that as strange as it seems it was a bigfoot. ,Between Dotsero and Glenwood Springs on I-70 WB. ,Eagle,6,Colorado ,CO,Winter ,8037,yes
828,While training at Ft Carson  I was on patrol with a Marine Recon Agressor Force  agressing fire batteries in simulated attacks.  My patrol attacked the HQ company  and during the withdrawal  I was separated from my unit.  There was plenty of ambient light  and I could see my unit across the field and hear them calling for me.  They took off  and I figured I could cut through a wooded area and intercept them.  As I rounded a bend in the trail  a figure stepped out into the trail in front me.  It was about 6.5 feet tall  covered in light brown fur  had large fox-like ears  and large  black  globe-shaped eyes.  The nostrils were slitted and large  without much nasal definition.  The body was muscular  with a thin waist and easily discernible definition  and the arms were long  hanging below the level of the hips.  The creature stepped out into the trail  looking in the opposite direction  and I had stopped stock-still the moment I saw it.  It turned and saw me  at which it exhibited a startle reflex then immediately crouched down and slowly moved sideways off the trail  watching me the entire time.  It knelt behind a bush  at which point it became very hard to see. I realized that I was encountering something few people have the opportunity to see  at only a distance of about 10 feet. ,Cheyenne Mountain  near NORAD. ,El Paso,7,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8041,yes
829,The creature was seen during mid fall snow storm from the east bound lane of Highway 24. Traffic was backed up due to snow and ice on the highway bringing traffic to a standstill after stepping out of the vehicle we saw a woman pointing up onto the hillside. We observed the creature about two hundred feet above the highway on a ridge-line ofver looking the road.

831,My family was on vacation in Colorado Springs  Co  last summer. We were driving up Pike  s Peak on the main road  and turned off onto the first rest area parking lot. The region was composed of large and small rock formations and was forested  primarily with pine trees. A stream was across the street. It is an area that is not inhabited by human  except for the traffic on the road  tourists visiting Pike  s Peak. I was standing on top of a large rock formation  looking down on my dad  who was about to take my picture with his camera. I shouted   Dad  look!  as I saw what I immediately believed to be a bigfoot 100 feet behind him. My dad did not turn around and look at the bigfoot  because he wanted to take my picture. The bigfoot was in motion  black  and was quickly out of sight. I know what bears look like  because I did a report for school on bears last year.

832,Last year during archery season my 12year old son and I were elk hunting off Rampart Range road between forest rd 322 and Mt Herman rd and herd strange noises. I am an avid archery hunter and have hunted all typs of animals all my life and what we herd that night still sends shivers down my spine. I do alot of calling for myself and friends for elk so I am familiar with alot of noises in the woods  we had seen elk in the aera the week prior to this incident. We drove in to the end of a trail off 322 and parked the car it was getting late and having my son with me I decided to just go to the end of the trail that overlooked 3 beaver ponds and try calling. We got to where we could see the ponds and sat down to wait a few minutes and listen for bugling elk. After hearing nothing for a few minutes I decided to call  when I bugeled from the ridge opposit us we herd what seemed like part elk  part cat  whining  but it sounded like there was 20 or 30 animals on the ridge across from us all making this moening/whining type noise. It lasted about 15 seconds. I wasent sure what I had just heard so I bugeled again we heard the same noise again. I didn  t recignize the noise and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up so I decided to leave. I also heard water splashing  it was getting dark and I looked all over the beaver pond through binos and could see nothing moving so we left. There is very few animal noises in the forrest that I do not recignize much less make me nervous but those noises we heard that night I will never forget. ,Between balanced rock rd and Mt Herman rd aprox 1/4 mile east of rampart range rd. ,El Paso,7,Colorado ,CO,Fall ,8041,no
833,My son and I were turkey hunting on BLM land near Fort Carson  CO. We arrived in the area around 0930hrs. My son is only 3 and 1/2 years old  so we were moving slowly to find a good spot to set up. We were approximately 500 yards off the west side of Sate Hwy 115 in the Table Mountain area. We found a decent site to set up on and started our hunt. I called a few times with my diaphram calls and we heard one turkey gobble about 100yds away. My sun was busy playing with rocks right next to our site. At about 1030hrs I noticed a truck driving down a dirt road that runs through the area. I watched the truck drive through the area and as it turned down a left hand bend in the road  I caught some movement out the corner of my right eye. The movement was approximately 600yds away. I picked up my binoculars to get a better look  hoping it was a turkey coming in to my calls. When I got focused on the object  it definately appeared larger than a turkey  so I checked it out more and focused the lenses better. What I saw  I don  t know for sure  but it appeared to be walking upright on its hind legs and and was covering a great deal of ground in a short span of time but was not running. I estimated the being to be approximately 6-7ft in height. It was walking northwest from my location. After about a minute or two it disappeared into some high brush and thickets. That terrain went up and over a little rise. I did not see anything else after that. We left the area about an hour later. I was shakin a little bit from excitement  but didn  t want to hang around too much longer. I have told no one of this thinking myself to be a little crazy at the time  but I know I wasn  t seeing things and it actualy hapened. I only tell this now to get it off my chest and let you guys determine if what I have said and seen is true or not. The temperature was warm and the sky was clear and sunny. ,Area can be reached via HWY 115 from the north or south...Exit I-25 on South Academy BLVD and drive south to the intersection of Academy BLVD and HWY 155  then drive south approximately 20 minutes. ,El Paso,7,Colorado ,CO,Spring ,8041,yes

835,My family and myself were in Colorado on vacation. We we going down the Phantom Canyon between Florence and Canon City Colorado. We were probably 5 miles into the canyon when we made a curve in the road and I noticed out the right side of the car several cows standing around and a large black furry thing  kind of bent a little in the knees walking around the cows. He looked maybe 7 to 8 foot tall. He was swinging his arms really fast like he was trying to get away in a hurry.I never saw his face he had his back to me. I was shocked at first and could not really say anything but about 5 minutes later I told my Dad and he turned around and went back to the place where I had saw him. There was nothing there by then except the cows. We drove back a couple of miles and some people were camping but they were packing up to leave. My Mom and Dad did not believe me for a long time  but a few years after that they had went back and had heard that someone else had seen such a thing around Colorado and that something had tried to get into someones house not far from there and had found some fur on their back screen door. This was back in 1985. Noone had ever really believed me but on 8-7-03 I watched a special on Discovery Travel and they had some reachers on there trying to track a Bigfoot sighting in Oklahoma  so I looked up your web page when I got to work today. ,When you come in from Pueblo headed towards Canon City you will see a sign on the right that says Phantom Canyon and It is also I short cut to Cripple Creek and the back way to Colorado Springs. ,Fremont,5,Colorado ,CO,Summer ,8043,yes

I was so startled I dropped down behind the counter with my cat and when I peaked over the eyes were gone.

837,I was talking with my sister in the spare room. She and her kids were spending the night. Her kids were sleeping and she was just getting into bed. My two dogs were barking outside  so I decided to take them for a walk since I figured they wanted me to take them out of the cage to do their business. I went to the backyard and opened the cage  but before I let them out  I placed the leash on their necks so they wouldn  t run around and make trouble. They were barking more then usual  like when company arrives in the drive way  but there was no one.  I went to the front of the house and got to the street. I noticed that the bushes in front of the neighbor  s house were moving and thought it may be a deer. As I kept walking I looked back to the bushes with curiousity and I noticed a figure walking from the bushes towards the back of the neighbor  s house. Their entire front and back yard was lit due a full moon and I could see a human shape going towards the back slowly  almost like hiding. It was weird because I could see the reflection of the moon on its entire body  as if it was wearing something that reflected the light very well. I turned around with the dogs and went down the hill towards the end of the street. I kept looking to the left since I knew that whatever I saw (if it wasn  t human) had to cross an opening across the other neighbor  s front yard to escape into the woods. As I approched the mailbox of the last house of the dead end  I kept looking to the house on the left  their driveway went up hill. The full moon illuminated the driveway very well. I stopped and waited about a minute. The dogs started barking even more. Then I saw something running on two legs across and the dogs wanted to go after it  the chain almost slipped from my hands and they were pulling so hard. The thing ran across and went into the trees. The entire body had what appeared to be hair all over. I couldn  t tell  whether the fur was dark gray or brown. I  m leaning more to brown. But everything else was as clear as day. I then thought to myself  if it was a thief dressed in a monkey suit going from yard to yard thru people  s properties why then wasn  t he smart enough to wait until I left with my dogs to run across? And if it was a practical joke from someone  that guy must had really had to have guts of steel to listen to mad barking dogs and still run. Besides  it  s a crime to traspass thru multiple houses   yards  specially so late at night just for a joke. I told my sister the next day about it  she remembered the unusual loud barkings of the dogs and she confessed she felt a little concerned about it. I  m glad she believed me. I didn  t tell my parents though. . That  s the first and last experience I had with something I couldn  t explain. , ,New London,3,Connecticut ,CT,Summer ,9011,yes

840,This took place 53 years ago  however  I have lived with the vision of this creature all my life and have told no one about it. I was visiting a relative  s cottage on Housatonic Lake near Indian Wells State Park in the White Hills region of Shelton  CT. Back then (1953) this area was not inhabited very densely and still is not today. There were 3 of us  all age 5-6  and we left the cottage and headed for the railroad track  which ran along the Housatonic River and Lake  to pick wild blackberries to put on our cereal. It was about 1/3 mile from the cottage. As we were busy picking  a large (6 1/2   to 7   tall) creature came down the steep hillside and proceeded to walk northward along the railroad tracks  staring at the 3 of us once  and moving at a fast walk. I remember the length of it  s stride (about 5  ) and it  s arms which looked like they went almost to it  s knees. The body was covered in a dark brown/grayish color hair and it had the face of a primate. The hair was shorter than Bigfoots I  ve seen on TV (Patterson film) and it  s body was thinner than those also. We ran back to the cottage to tell our parents who dismissed this as children  s fantasy. This event took place BEFORE there was ever a mention of anything like Bigfoot  especially in this area. ,Proceding north on Howe Ave. in Shelton  CT take a left at Indian Wells State Park.

841,Me and my mother were in the kitchen washing dishes around 11 30p.m. around thanksgiving 2004. We heard a loud BANG! on the far side of the house . Me and my mother just looked at each other and I said what was that! so we went to the location were we heard the noise and I witnessed  a BIG shadow larger than a human moving by the window. I estimate aroud 7/1/2 - 8ft ft tall.After the incident I went upstairs and my mother told me the next morning that she felt like she was being watched for about 3 hrs. and was quite unerved by the whole thing. ---------------- [From the aunt of the witness above  who lives roughly one mile away  bordering the same stretch of woods ] It was late June around 3 00A.M. it was hot humid night being a sound sleeper  I was awakened by a loud sound  one I have never heard in my life I live near a State forest called Salmon River State park in East Hampton CT  for almost 25 years. I know all the animal sounds   as I am an animal lover  avid hiker and camper . I have never heard such  an animal sound like this  It was an incredible kind of screaming. It lasted for several minutes. The closest I have ever heard was on your site. I live in Moodus Ct  in Middlesex County. ,Middlesex county ,Middlesex,6,Connecticut ,CT,Winter ,9007,no
842,This sighting happened when I was a young boy of about seven or eight years of age. It was a cloudy fall day. I was playing near a window in a second story farm house when something caught my eye. I watched as a hairy nine-foot creature walked up hill across the front yard. It had a huge stride  as if it were in a hurry. It kept looking back as it walked with its long swinging arms. When it turned its head it had to also turn its shoulders to be able to look at a 90-degree angle. I stood watching it walk along when it apeared to look up and make eye contact with me for only a second. It never broke its stride. It  s eyes glowed like a raccoon or a cat at night when light is shined in their eyes. What frightened me was that it was still daylight. I didn  t get really freaked until it disapeared around the side of the house. That  s when I ran in to the kitchen were my parents were playing cards with another couple. I tried to get their attention but they didn  t have time for a whiny kid who wanted a cookie or candy. It wasn  t until they escorted me out the front door and slammed it in my face that they figured out something was wrong  There was no way I was going to hang around out side with a monster in the area. I flipped out --screaming  beating kicking the door  and crying for them to let me in. It was only a couple or three seconds and they knew something was terrible wrong. They let me in and I explained what I had just seen through tears. My father and his friend went outside to look around  probably thinking they would find a loose cow. I  ll never forget the look on their faces when they saw the foot prints that dwarfed their own. My dad  s friend was a tall man of around six foot two or three. When he stretched his legs to step from one foot print to another it was next to impossible. Their disbelief had turned to fear. They did however want to follow the tracks that went across a field that had been plowed recently. I freaked out again. They seemed to understand this time. They decided that going in a car would be better. We drove down a road a short distance  found were it crossed and went on up a hill. The tracks disapeared and that seemed fine with everyone. ,Newton farm ,Litchfield,10,Connecticut ,CT,Fall ,9005,yes
843,My friend and I were out late on a saturday night visiting some girls.  We didn  t have a car and we had walked about 7 or 8 miles to arrive.  We were both on the JV soccer team at our highschool and even though the season was over we were in very good shape.  For this reason we jogged maybe half the trip which got us there in time for saturday night live.  We stayed long enough for me to watch SNL with one girl and my friend to spend some private time with his beau.  It got to be late and we knew we had a long trip back to his place. I felt fine and wanted to leave after awkwardly watching TV with this girl.  Getting to this location was easy because it was mostly downhill  but getting back was going to take longer. We were still in good shape so we jogged most of the way back up the long hill on Town Hill Rd.(219) near Bakersville  but in New Hartford  CT. It was a crisp night without much moonlight. We had grown comfortable jogging side by side in the middle of the road.  Since it was so late nobody was out driving and we set a consistent pace for about 2 hours.  We finally made it to the top of the long hill where Route 219 flattens out.  We were casually jogging in the middle of the road past houses and an occasional farm when we heard a bad sound. It made us stop dead in our tracks and we were both frightened.  It came from the left of the road perhaps behind a farm and a fair distance away.  I distinctly remember turning my head as the sound swept from left to right and thinking to myself that is a big sound. I would like to comment on the sound.  I have spent alot of time in the woods of Connecticut and was familiar with sounds from area wildlife including birds  squirrels  coyotes  dogs etc.  I immediately asked my friend  What the f!$# was that?   He responded that he did not know.  From the left  the sound was a cry that sounded like a cross between a baby and a woman screaming bloody murder that started very high  held for a number of seconds  and then came down in pitch.  When it got lower it changed into a broken cackle that made the echoes more pronounced.  It was very disturbing and unlike anything we had ever heard.  I asked my friend if he wanted to stay and check it out but he was very disturbed and did not want to hang around.  It was a bad sound that you don  t want to hear in the middle of night.  We stood there for a few moments confused and scared  and decided to get going. We continued jogging for another hour discussing along the way what it could be.  Eventually we became more relaxed and the conversation moved onto other things like the events earlier in the evening.  Things were fine again and we were making good progress over a few more miles when we heard the sound again  this time on the right side of the road and closer. Again it was a blood curdling scream that held for a few seconds  slowly descended in pitch and cackled at the end  but on the other side of the road and closer.  We were now more scared and both had the feeling we were being followed or tracked.    I turned to my friend and said pointedly that we might not get another chance like this again and I grabbed his arm.  In panic he cocked his right arm back and said some expletives to the extent that if I did not let go he would lay me out flat right there.  He sprinted down the road without me and I had no choice but to follow him since I lost sight of him in the dark.  I caught up with him soon enough and we quietly jogged the remainder of the distance to his house though we were shaky. For years he was not open to talking about what we heard and he apologized for threatening me and leaving me standing there.  When it was discussed we never came to a decision about what it was. A few years ago I came across the BFRO website and started reading reports.  I listened to a few audio recordings from OHIO but nothing clicked until I read reports of screams.  The recordings on the site are like moans and long whoops  but some reports describe a more stressed vocalization that puts the listeners instantly into panic- this is what we heard.  Its a really really bad sound that is confusing because it sounds sort of familiar  but is so extreme its difficult to describe.  The reports I have read that describe the scream include hunters and military folks who pretty much bolt when they hear it. Since this happened I have worked professionally in molecular genetics and neurobiology at UCONN and Yale University.  I have also had careers in the financial industry as a quantitative analyst  and as a sound designer and audio engineer to the musical instrument industry. Whatever made the sound was able to project over a great distance  and kept up with us over enough miles to convince us we were being stalked.  I cannot say for sure what made the sound  but based on  other credible reports in the BFRO database  the similarity to other screams and our own responses  a sasquatch is my best candidate without invoking the supernatural which I personally would never do. Looking in the database for reports from Connecticut  the only one I found was surprisingly in the same County - Litchfield. ,This happened on Town Hill Rd  Rt 219 going toward New Hartford from Bakersville. ,Litchfield,10,Connecticut ,CT,Fall ,9005,no
844,There is a small pond located in the wildlife management area in Harwinton. I have frequently visited this place throughout my youth  and adulthood to fish  camp  hike  bike  and hunt. The pond is spring fed  and is located in a flood conroll area. A town built dam at one end helps contoll the water level  but at the time of the incident the dam was poorly built. In late summer the water level in the pond would drop drastically  and create a higher concenration of fish. The best time to go fishing was at night when temps. were cooler. On this one particular night I decided to go moonlight topwater bassi  n alone. I parked my car at the entance gate around 9 00pm  and proceeded on foot down the service road. The moonlight was intense  and afforded me the luxury of saving my flashlight batteries for most of the treck. The trip from the road to the pond is approx. 3/4 of a mile  and takes you through several fields wich are cut in the summer.On the way i startled some deer that were around a salt lick  they ran off in the opposite direction of the pond. I walked through the final field  and over a stone wall  onto a path that leads directly to the spot on the pond where i wanted to fish.The area from the stone wall to the pond is wooded  and recquired use of the flashlight. The path  and woodline end in an area of land that juts out into the pond  forming a point. Due to the low water level  it was another 50 yds. walk to get to the waters edge. I fished off of a couple of rocks that jutted out even further. I had been fishing for approximately an hour  and havig some luck. The moon was full  and almost directly overhead. I was out in the wide open  and could see very well all around the shoreline. The woodline around the pond was spaced from the water at least 30yards plus in all directions. The moonlight did not penetrate into the woods  and so I could not see into them. I felt as though I were on center stage to anything that might be in the woods wathing me. All of a sudden out of nowhere a loud and deep sound eminated direclty from the woodline where I had entered the area. My knees went weak  and I nearly fell off the rocks. I turned to face the area in a ducking position trying to see what it was. The sound was again repeated after a short pause  and then nothin. I pointed my flashlight in the direction of the sound but it was too far and too weak  not even an eyeshine. This was all that I heard. The sounds were as follows  WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSFSSS!!-twice in succession  then a short pause (10 sec.) followed by the same WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSSS!!-Twice in succession. The sounds were deep  and came from something large  (200+lbs.) They echoed across the pond! They were definitely directed at me  something was letting me know it was there. I found it odd that pryor to and after  there were no sounds of walking in the woods. Watever this was made a stealthy approach  and exit. I never heard anything again. I stayed and fished nervously for another hour  and left the area scared but without incident.  ,The incident took place in the Roraback Wildlife Management area.I entered off of south road there are two closed access service roads that lead to the pond  one is paved  the other is not but leads almost directly to the area of incident. ,Litchfield,10,Connecticut ,CT,Summer ,9005,no
845,My Aunt has owned a large piece of land  over a hundred acres  in northwest Connecticut for many years now. Her property is located in a state park that is mostly uninhabited and only frequented by backpackers. Her land is well off of any main roads  and we have to drive through a lot of forest to reach her house. She bought the land and remodeled the old house that was already built on it so that it was more livable  and going up to visit her has always been my favorite thing to do. I have been going yearly since I was a baby and have spent countless hours exploring the woods  creeks  and land around the house. We call it â€œthe farmâ€ although it is not a true agricultural or livestock farm. My Aunt does have rescue miniature horses  alpacas  donkeys  and back in the day there were ducks. The animals are on one part of the property where area has been cleared out for them to graze  get fat  and be happy. The rest of the farm is untouched woodlands. In the early 2000s she decided to install 12â€™ ft fencing around the property  although it only encloses about 80 acres of the land she owns. She explained to me that she could not stand the sounds of the coyotes howling right outside her window at night  and that she had some creepy encounters while living there. She did not go into the details of these at the time since I was a young child. She lives alone  so I understand why she wanted to feel a semblance of security in those deep woods. We are originally from the bayous of Louisiana  so being in this type of environment was new to all of us. Anyway  despite being initially unfamiliar with the land  I eventually learned to navigate the area very well as a child. I had a few favorite spots  and one was up a small foot hill in the deepest part of the woods. I would go up so often that eventually a small path was established in the brush  and I would bring my cousins with me to show them my little oasis. In 2008  when I was about 10 years old  I took a summer trip to my Aunts and brought my best friend Alex with me. She and I often took trips here together during our childhood and this was not her first time accompanying me to the farm. I remember that we were in the woods at my favorite spot  sitting together and listening to Katy Perry while playing Doodle Jump on our new iPod touches. This makes me laugh to remember  but we were just trying to enjoy some nature while getting our fill of new tech  I guess. We were there for a while enjoying ourselves and talking about random kid stuff when there was this shift in the air  almost like a suffocating stillness and silence settled upon the woods. I paused the music and looked to Alex  who was already staring at me with a concerned and worried expression on her face. We stayed still and silent for a minute  tilting our heads to listen to the woods and search out any of the familiar sounds that normally crescendoed day and night across the farm. There were no birds  no summer bugs  and the trees almost seemed to stand frozen in place  as if the light winds that normally rustled their leaves left us completely. It was a vulnerable  terrible feeling and I knew Alex felt it too. Then began the sound of footsteps coming from even deeper in the woods. It took a moment for me to determine what the sound was  but the distinct rhythm of weight being picked up and put down on leaves and brush was impossible not to notice. It was bipedal and heavy  and was coming up towards us from a steep slope down the side of the mountain/foothill. I remember thinking that it was impossible for a human to move so easily through that part of the woods  since it was very thick with growth  fallen branches  trees  and rocks  even making it hard for an agile small child to navigate  let alone a large adult. It felt as if the woods lay still in wait while these footsteps made their way swiftly up the steep incline towards us. â€œDo you hear that?â€ I asked Alex in a whisper. She nodded. â€œIt sounds like footstepsâ€¦â€ I continued. She nodded again  looking like she was about to burst into tears. I took her hand and began running down the makeshift path with her  trying not to fall or let her lag behind me at all. We did not stop until we reached the house. I donâ€™t think we told anyone that day  because we were just too shaken to even comprehend what might have been out there. The next day I asked Alex if she would go back out to the spot with me. She was very hesitant and first  but eventually agreed and said we could go look for signs of another human. We made our way back  nervous but determined to discover what had invaded our little sanctuary. When we reached the spot  I looked down towards the direction we had heard the footsteps. I think I even slid down a bit to investigate passible indentations in the brush and leaves. I did not go too far because I was about to lose my nerve  and I hadnâ€™t noticed much anyway  so I quickly climbed back up to where Alex waited nervously for me. We decided that it mustâ€™ve been some sort of animal  or deer  despite every logical explanation indicating otherwise. I knew what deer sounded like  and that was not a deer  but I wanted to forget and have fun again. We took our iPods out and began the same ritual of relaxing and playing games while chatting about nonsense. It seemed that things were back in their natural order again  so we quickly forgot about the terrifying experience and let our naive childlike wonder take over. After a little while  the stillness returned  and it happened so quickly it felt as if the forest took a gasp and never exhaled. This time  the footsteps started almost immediately. They were louder  and coming from a different direction. The best way I can explain their location is that it was in a similar spot to the day before  but somewhat more to the right where the forest was very dark and the incline to reach us was less steep. I did not wait too long to run  but it was long enough to realize that the sound was faster  closer  and definitely not a deer or bear. It is not a super exciting story  but that is my first creepy experience in the woods. I have since had more  as I am an avid backpacker and love the outdoors. But the experiences on her land have always been the most bizarre and inexplicable. If anyone has any ideas about wtf this was  please comment or DM me! I think about it every time I am in any woods. It still sends chills up my spine to remember. I did not look into the woods too closely because I wanted to get the hell out of there and was too scared to see whatever it was. I knew it was close enough that it would be upon us any moment if we did not flee. So without a word  Alex and I took off and ran as fast as humanely possible out of those woods. Extra info  the area we were at is pretty far away from the main house and any other civilization. We asked my aunt if there were any men on the property and she said no  there were not. She also confirmed that the gates were in working order  although it wouldnâ€™t be hard for a bear to breach them  or for a fox to dig underneath them. ,Please do not post the exact address online since it is private property.

847,It was early evening and our golden retriever was barking loudly. This was not unusual as there are many deer behind our house. Our back yard consists of a large twenty acre field leading into a wooded area. When I went outside to call the dog in and I saw six or seven deer running like heck like they were being chased  I looked behind them and in the tall grass a large hairy animal was chasing after them running on two legs towering above the grass which was around four feet tall at the time. We see occasional black bears but this was like no bear I had seen before. I am convinced it was a squatch. Then later in the season I was outside at around nine o-clock with a friend we had a small fire going. The coyotes were yipping in the far corner and in the opposite back corner there was a large screech like sound and the coyotes went dead silent. , ,Litchfield,10,Connecticut ,CT,Summer ,9005,yes

849,I don  t have a specific incident to report but I live in a rural area of Torrington CT. While my wife and I have never seen anything we hear strange noises constantly starting at dusk and continuing through the night. At least once every couple of months we hear knocking and dragging noises against our house and on windows that are approximately 6 and half feet off the ground. Occasionally load thumps against the house are also heard. Once in a while on our porch smoking a cigarette  me and a friend experienced something very large running through the field behind my house. We could not see anything but from my experience in the area it was very heavy and moving in a straight line across the field.

852,On July 3rd  2016  at around 7AM I was fishing at Norwich Pond in Lyme  CT.  I caught my first fish within minutes of arriving.  When I brought the fish to shore I heard 3 distinct knocks coming from behind and above me. There is a rather steep  high (30 ft?) slope along the access road near the boat ramp. I turned around thinking it was people walking down the road.  Nothing there...  I threw the fish back and recast.  I caught another within a few minutes.  As i brought this one to shore  I heard another 3 distinct knocks from the same spot and again turned around to see if someone was there.  No one! This boat launch/pond is about 4 - 5 miles in from the main road and the only houses around were on the other side of the pond  the opposite direction of the knocks.  I am pretty sure it was an encounter with Sasquatch even though I did not see or smell one.  The knocking was too  human  to be an animal and there were NO people around. , ,Middlesex,6,Connecticut ,CT,Summer ,9007,no
853,Walking in woods about 50 yds off trail with my adult son. There was a stone wall about about 30 yds from me. I noticed a black figure behind this 2 ft. high wall. The animal was very black. I thought it was a bear at first. After 5 seconds it stood up and walked deeper into the woods. It looked to be around 5 ft tall. I never saw a face. It just got up with its back to me and walked away fast. It had a cone shaped head  no neck  a slim looking body  very black hair  swinging arm was very long  legs seemed shorter. It moved fast but it didnâ€™t run. I yelled to my son who was about 20yds from my left. We tried to follow it. My son never had a visual but he could hear it crunching ahead of us. We looked for about 3 hrs trying to see it again but could not find anything. ,North Chestnut Hill Rd. north of Abner Lane. ,Middlesex,6,Connecticut ,CT,Fall ,9007,yes
854,It was approximately late July early Aug  I canâ€™t recall but was summer 1987. At the Burlington Bristol Townline in Connecticut there was a woodsy area behind a Cumberland Farms store we used to go up there camping or have cake parties. One night three friends and I went up there to camp for the night. We arrived approximately 6 PM. We kept hearing what sounded like with knocks. We shrugged it off thinking there was other people up there.  Approximately 11 oâ€™clock that night we started hearing what sounded like whooping sounds.  One of the friends Mike that I was with was an avid hunter. His father has been taking him hunting since he was young and even though he was 16 he spent a lot of time in the woods with his dad.  He was trying to figure out what that sound was or what animal made it. He could not figure out any animal that made that sound.  Again we shrugged it off and chalked it up to maybe a couple of our friends are messing with us. We decided to go to bed and we kept hearing somebody walking around our camping area. We all climbed out of the tents and started yelling at our friends that theyâ€™re not scaring us they might as well just go home.  We continue to hear noises of somebody walking around for about 30 minutes.  We just assumed it was them and we went back into the tent to go to sleep. About 20 minutes later my friend Mike grabs my arm and said holy cowâ€™s  someone just walked by and stepped on my hand as he was real close to the edge of the tent. The four of us were in one tent so it was a little tight I said well maybe it was an animal Mike. Maybe everything weâ€™ve been hearing was the animal. He said no this was a foot  a really big foot. The two boys were scared to get out of the tent so us two girls got out of the tent and looked around. We didnâ€™t see anything but we did hear something heavy walking very quickly away from our campsite.  Never did we ever consider it being a big foot.  It was just not something we even thought of  until years later when we realized oh my God remember that night we went camping !?  That was a bigfoot! We were young and we never even really heard anything about a big foot back then , ,Hartford,2,Connecticut ,CT,Summer ,9003,no
855,I have a couple of incidents to report  both took place near Bethel  CT at the property I owned/lived on at the time. These incidents took place in May of 2013 if I recall correctly. I lived set back in the woods up a long driveway not completely surrounded by forest but mostly. There were a couple houses a hundred or more feet away but I was pretty isolated. I pulled up to my house in front of my garage. I was facing a small chunk of woods behind an old stone wall that was very brushy and bushy and had a lot of big rocks and uneven ground and it all went slightly up hill. I got out of the car with my 4 and a half month old German Shepherd and she uncharacteristically ran away from me toward the aforementioned stone wall barking very aggressively like a full grown Shepherd in protection mode. I was curious what sort of creature could get her to react like that so I took my flashlight out of the car and shined it in the brush but it was so heavy all I could see was a dark shadow moving about 20 ft or so ahead of me very slowly  sounding almost bipedal  like it wasn  t very afraid but was keeping its distance. Finally it got to somewhat of a clearing but was crouching and hiding behind a tree poking its head out from behind repeatedly. I wondered what dark bulky figure could have bright reddish orange eyes and move from crouching to standing relatively tall so I initially figured it must have been a black bear and I called my dog inside and went about my business. The very next night I pulled into the same spot and I had a friend with me and we got out of the car and we both heard a large bellowing roar a couple times and it sounded like it was in the area I saw the  bear  the night before. He asked me  what the f--- is that  and I said it must have been what I assumed was the bear I encountered the night before. It wasn  t until a few months later when I was watching some videos on sasquatch encounters did I realize what I really saw. Not only that but black bears don  t roar. The roar I heard sounded like vocalization recordings of angry sasquatch and the movements of the head and color of the eyes were exactly as anyone who encountered them had reported. According to another sasquatch reporting site there was a sighting in the late 70s in the town next to Bethel (Danbury) and a cast was taken of prints. I firmly believe it was a sasquatch I encountered. ,Woodsy and hilly and very rocky but with neighborhoods and houses scattered about. ,Fairfield,7,Connecticut ,CT,Spring ,9001,yes
856,On Saturday afternoon on August 4  2018 at approximately 2pm my boyfriend and I were driving from Berlin to Woodbridge about halfway there I was staring out the passenger side window as my boyfriend was driving. In a clearing of the woods I saw what looked to be an extremely tall man with shoulder length dirty blonde hair. As I focused in I realized this 8 ft tall creatureâ€™s arms  chest and legs were also covered in the same long dirty blonde hair. He was walking north with the back of his hands facing forward  swaying like a gorilla as he walked on two legs. As we passed him I jumped out of my seat and turned around and kept my eyes locked on him as long as I could. My boyfriend asked me why I did that and I told him  â€œI think just saw a Sasquatch. I just saw the weirdest thing and it was not a human.â€ And went on to describe what I saw. ,Spotted in the woods on the southbound side of the road (Wilbur Cross Parkway) ,Hartford,2,Connecticut ,CT,Summer ,9003,yes
862,This incident happened around 1947/48.  I was about 12/13 years of age.  I have held this incident in my mind  s eye all these years and have tried to figure out what I had seen.  After reading sightings and descriptions on your website  I beleive what I saw could well have been a sasquatch. It was summer time and I was riding my horse  Jenny.  We were going to visit a neighbor.  I was on my regular path through the woods when I saw a lone  large  dark figure.  At first I thought it was a man making  cat faces  on the pine trees.  There were a lot of trees in that area  that were being used to collect resin.  It looked as if the man had on a raincoat.  That seemed very strange to me as it was a clear and hot day.  And then when I looked closer  it looked like a fur coat and that really made no sense because it was summer and very warm.  The  person  was a distance from me and I hesitate to even try and say how far.  As I was scrutinizing this  person   Jenny suddenly stopped and threw her ears forward and raised her head.  She  too  had seen the  man .  I urged her to go forward by kicking her in her sides  but she refused to move.  I decided to turn her around and go another direction in order to make her think we were not interested in the  man .  She gladly went in the oposite direction.  When I saw she would go in another direction  I turned her around and again proceeded toward the  man .  Because Jenny sensed a danger  I was uneasy at this point.  She continued to carry me in the direction of the furry man until we approached to spot she had stopped at before.  She again pointed her ears forward  raised her head  smelled the air and refused to move another step. I watched the creature for awhile as I felt I was at a safe distance.  It was at a large pine tree.  It was making up and down motions (like it could have been scratching its back).  The arms seemed to be raised in the air as it made these undulating motions.  I sat there on Jenny trying to figure out if the creature had on a fur coat or a rain coat and if so  what for?  As I mentioned  I have pondered this for years and it finally makes sense to me in the context of a sasquatch sighting. This took place in Putnam County about 5 miles northe of US 17 in the deep pine forest near my home.  Rice Creek is about 1 mile further north on US 17.  The nearest town is Palatka  Florida - about 5 miles. My mother used to tell me of hearing screams like a woman screaming.  Of course  that could have been a panther.  I never heard any of these sounds. ,The open pine woods of north Florida. ,Putnam,7,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12107,yes
863,We lived in a rural area of central Florida that was mostly pine forest.  There were a few hundred acres on derelict citrus groves nearby as well as a cypress swamp to the north and east of the pine forest.  The area we lived in was roughly 4 square miles between paved roads  but to the north  east  and west beyond the area I am describing  there were additional substantial areas of pine forest  palmetto scrub  and dense cypress swamp. Our house was situated on the crest of a hill  or at least what passes for a hill in that part of Florida. It was about 8 00 one night and I was home alone with my father.  My parents were separated and my father would occasionally come to stay with me when my mother and siblings were out.  During the late fall and winter months  it was our custom to shoot rabbits at night.  Our house was roughly square  with small flood lights on each corner of the house that would illuminate our small yard area and the edge of the tree line out back to the north and west.  We would typically wait until it was fully dark before we would go out.  We would load our shotgun in the house  get our flash lights ready  and on occasion my father would wear a headlamp  or as he called it â€œa one-eyed dogâ€.  We would leave the corner flood lights of the house off until we were ready  then we would turn the lights on and quickly step out the back door.  Most of the time there would be a rabbit or two  nibbling the grass at the border between our poorly kept lawn and edge of the forest.  Not a difficult shot with a shotgun at just under 30 yards. On this particular night it was my fatherâ€™s turn to shoot.  I held a large flashlight  he held a Stevenâ€™s 12 gauge side by side double barrel and wore a less than powerful headlamp.  As we flipped the lights on and emerged from the back door he stepped to the right and panned east towards an old ear tree at the edge of the grass.  I turned west towards the northwest corner of our yard where there was a clothes line and an old bench my grandfather had made.  On the edge of our yard  just 6 or 8 feet from the tree line  was a large  crouched figure.  When I first saw the figure it was reasonably well lit from the flood lights on the house and from the upper edge of my flashlight beam.  By my first glimpse of the creature it was already moving  springing up from a crouch to a fully erect  bi-pedal stance while simultaneously rotating away from me (turning to the creatureâ€™s right).  As there was motion when I first saw it  I was not able to get any meaningful look at its face.  But as it turned I saw the creature with very good clarity from a distance of just under 30 yards.  It was not a giant creature â€“ it was almost the same height as my father (who was 5â€10â€)  perhaps an inch or two shorter than he was.  Most of my view of the creature was from the back after it had turned and started moving away.  The creature was clearly much stockier than a man  with very large shoulders and not very much narrowing noticeable at the waste.  Its upper legs were thick and powerful looking.   It was covered in fur of medium length â€“ not shaggy or super long  but long enough to obscure the details of most muscle tone.   The fur was longer than that of a deer  yet not quite as long or as deep or dark as a bear.  The fur was not especially dark and was certainly not black.  The flashlight we had back then made everything look a little bit lighter  and a little bit more bluish purple than it really was  which I had previously observed many times when examining close up the rabbits that we had shot. The creature took 3 or 4 very distinct strides before its lower body became obscured from view by some undergrowth.  Its shoulders and head were visible for perhaps another two or three strides and then nothing could be seen because of pine branches and the fact that the creature moved beyond the area illuminated by the flood lights on the house.  I never shown my flashlight directly on it as I was stunned to the point of both immobility and speechlessness as soon as I saw it.  I will never forget the distinct look of the creature from behind.  It had some kind of deformity.  Its head was tilted quite far down on the left side with that side of its head at an awkward angle to its shoulder.  It was like the muscles or tendons in the left side of his neck had been injured and were now contracted a bit and shorter than the muscle on the right side.  It was not a temporary position or part of the creature sudden movement; that awkward  left leaning head position was maintained even as the creature ran away. I do not recall any vocalizations or any specific smell.  I do remember the sound of twigs snapping and leaves and pine needles crunching very loudly as the creature moved away.  The sound of it moving through the forest and undergrowth was quite distinct and had a cadence that no other local creature made.   The sound of the creature running stopped when the creature reached a small clearing about 70 yards into the woods (or I assume that is why the sound of its exit stopped based on its direction). My father who was with me saw nothing  although he heard the creatureâ€™s exit.  He was facing about 160 degrees opposed to where I was facing and the entire incident lasted perhaps only 3 or 4 seconds.  My father asked me what was going on and I was absolutely (and very literally) speechless.  I could not speak!  I simply pointed and stood there frozen.  He took me in the house and tried to get me calmed down  but it was more than 5 minutes before I could speak.  I remember feeling fear  but I think my physical reaction was actually a mild form of shock.  What I saw was so unbelievable  so unexpected  and so close.  I suspect my physical reaction would not have been any different than if I had seen a headless horseman. After about 10 minutes I had recounted what I saw two or three times to my father  who was clearly in disbelief but quite moved by my physical reaction.  At about this time we heard a loud  but distance barking  howling and baying from our closest neighbors hunting dogs which he kept in a large outdoor kennel at his home about 1 mile through the forest from our home.  We would occasionally hear the dogs bark at night â€“ but never like this.  I could see the look on my dadâ€™s face change from disbelief to some level of fear as the dogs made the most agitated sounds we had ever heard â€“ and that we never  ever heard again.  We tried to find the phone number for our neighbor with the dogs  but we didnâ€™t know where my mom kept it.  After about 20 minutes the dogs settle down a bit  although they continued to bark without the same level of agitation.  After another 10 or 15 minutes my father suggested that we go investigate the area where I saw the creature enter the woodsâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦I thought this was a really bad idea and wanted no part of it.  But my father insisted there was some explanation for what I had seen  and that I would feel better once I had things cleared up in my mind.   My mind was not unclear â€“ I was quite certain of what I had seen  although I could not explain it and had no name for it. Eventually we went outside  this time with both of us carrying shotguns. I refused to step away from the back door  but my father slowly ventured over to the area about 30 yards away and looked at the ground and the brush line.  He entered the brush line where I indicated and went perhaps 2 or 3 more steps and bent down again.  I kept my shotgun pointed in his general direction but not directly at him.  After just a few seconds my father came hurriedly back and said that we needed to get in the house.  He was clearly shaken and my construction worker  outdoorsman  purple-heart awarded father was afraid of nothing.   My father called the local Sheriffâ€™s office  but when he started to explain things he did not know what to say.  He explained that I had seen something and was scared to the point of being speechless.  He told the sheriff about the neighborâ€™s dogs. But the more he spoke  and the less he said about the specifics of what happened  the more frustrated he became.  He finally told the Sheriff â€œnever mindâ€ Iâ€™m sure it was nothing.  He did not give me any meaningful details of what he saw  but simply explains that â€œsomething big clearly went through there in a big hurry.â€  Both my father and I knew the woods well and we hunted all the time  spending hundreds of hours a year in these woods.  I had never seen anything like this creature before  and I never saw anything like it ever again.  I never saw any large animal tracks in that part of central Florida that I could not easily identify and I never saw any scat that I could not identify. ,3030 County Road 70  Palm Harbor. ,Pinellas,2,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12103,yes
864,This is an old sighting  having occurred around 1981 or 1982 in coastal Pasco County  Florida.  I have not reported this for professional reasons  but now that I am retired  this is less of a concern.  At the time  I was teaching an Oceanography class at the local community college.  One evening of the week would be classroom lecture on campus and another evening would be lab or fieldwork at a science center operated by the school district.  I was also director of the center.  The center is located on an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico called Salt Spring Run  and surrounded by a typical upper west coast Florida Juncus-Spartina marsh with mangrove islands.  After class  approximately 8 30 or 9 00 PM  I drove out of the gates of the center  got out to lock the gates  and then drove down the dirt access road to the center.  As I came round a bend in the road  a creature stepped out of the vegetation onto the road.  I stopped and stared at the creature  which was illuminated only by my headlights.  It did not seem frightened and simply stared back at the car.  We were about 40 â€“ 50 feet apart.  I had a chance to take a long hard look at the creature and tried to note everything I could.  It was not a human  nor was it an emaciated bear.  It had a simian face  flat nose (not a snout)  and ears on the side of its head.  It was slim  not heavily muscled  and was covered by grayish-brown hair or fur.  The hair was not thick and bushy.  It also stood only about 5.5 to 6 feet tall at most.  I could see the entire body of the animal because it was out in the road.  It was turned sideways to me and only its head turned in my direction.  Because of the angle of view  I could not tell if it was male or female.  I was not frightened by the thing because I was in an old Dodge station wagon I had at the time  which was a tank.  Also  the creature did not seem agitated or aggressive  but simply wary.  Eventually  the creature calmly walked across the road and into the salt marsh at the edge of the road.  I got out of the car with a flashlight and tried to get another look at the animal.  I sniffed and tried to detect any odor  but there was no odor.  I never heard any vocalizations.  I eventually drove home and told my wife  but did not share this with anyone else.  Eventually  I told my sons  one of which encouraged me to make this report.  At the time  I was not only sober  but also well rested.  I was not sleep deprived  and had at least a full minute to look at the creature.  I simply do not know what I was looking at.  The closest thing to what it looked like would be one of those National Geographic artists renditions of what an early hominid looked like â€“ not large  slim  a walk with knees slightly bent.  The next morning I surveyed the area  but found no tracks.  The road was hard-packed limerock and oyster shell and even shoe impressions werenâ€™t left.  Near where the creature entered the marsh is a small hammock with cabbage palm  saw palmetto  etc.  and it may have been moving toward that.  I found nothing in the hammock the next day. , ,Pasco,8,Florida ,FL,Unknown ,12101,yes
865,The incidents all took place on a private reserve of land called River Ranch over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend of 1985  friday night through early sunday afternoon. My uncle and I arrived at the family cabin at around 10 p.m. friday night and for the next hour or so we opened up the cabin  tested the generator and put the food in the refrigerator. My uncle had planned a full day of hunting the next day so we turned in after everything was put away. I had no trouble falling asleep and all was peaceful and very quiet. The next thing that happened still puts a chill up my spine 20 years later. I just remember waking up for no reason at almost 2 a.m. and then feeling very unsafe. About 10 seconds later  I heard some kind of crunching on the ground near the screen porch. Louder than the sound we were making ourselves walking on the same ground. Then  a few seconds later  I heard the screen door open then close quickly but not long enough for someone to come in. It was just click  woosh click. The second thing that struck me as odd was that my uncle  s red nose pit was awake but still curled up at the foot of the bunks. I could see his eyes moving around but he was not going to move a muscle. Not the case at home. I didn  t move from the bunk until it was light enough to see. From that point on  the only way to describe the rest of the trip is that it was very bizarre and un-relaxing. We are both 100% convinced that we were being watched and maybe even stalked by something. ,100 thousand + acre ranch and private hunting reserve between Lake Kissimme and Tiger Lake.

866,The witness   daughter originally submitted this report after he had relayed it to her. Subsequently  Vince Lauria and myself met with the witness on March 19  2003 and conducted a personal interview and had the witness take us to the actual sighting location. The following is the account of the sighting as told to us by the witness. On February 18  2003 at approx. 5 30 AM  the witness was heading eastbound on Interstate 10 when he saw what he first believed to be a person stepping out onto the highway just as a tractor-trailer rig had passed it. Because the tractor-trailer rig  s rear lights illuminated the animal he was able to see it.  The witness tapped his brakes to disengage the cruise control and turned on his high beams. He stated to us that his first thought was perhaps someone had broken down on the Interstate or been involved in an accident but when he got a better look at it  he realized it wasn  t human. He stated that   its hands hung almost to its knees and it moved in a hunched posture.  When questioned further  the witness stated that it moved with its knees bent in  almost a glide  and that its arms stayed by its side as opposed to swinging back and forth. He further described the creature as being approximately 7   in height; 250 to 275 pounds with a muscular   squatty  build and was covered with reddish hair. The head appeared to sit directly on the shoulders and was somewhat pointed. A note of interest; the witness told us the hair on it  s head looked  slicked back  as if it had just been combed  not as if it were wet. He also stated that the creature never looked toward his truck so he didn  t notice any facial detail. According to the witness  the creature wasn  t running but was moving  at a good trot . It crossed both traffic lanes and the breakdown lane in 4 or 5 steps. At the time of the sighting  the creature was approximately sixty to seventy yards from the witness  and the sighting lasted about thirty seconds  maximum. ,Interstate 10  east of Caryville ,Washington,54,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12133,yes

869,Witness and a friend were deer hunting that day. They were resting by their vehicles at approximately 1 30 pm when the witness looked north on the road (Rd. #1) and observed 2 Bigfoot crossing the road from west to east. The Bigfoot crossed from an oak hammack into an area of pines and tall palmettos. Approximately  225 yards east through the pines is a large swamp. The witness and his friend were roughly 2/10  of a mile away from the creatures when they crossed the road. The witness saw a large male  6.5 ft. tall with light brown hair cross the road first. When the witness first saw the male he thought it was another hunter walking around without an orange safety vest on. The witness states that it was walking weird and slightly hunched over. When the second one came into view (5.5 ft. tall) it was completely black and had breasts. She also appeared to be carrying something about her waist with both hands. The witness feels she was either very pregnant or carrying a young Bigfoot. The male was 15 yards in front of the female. The witness states that the female had hairy breasts and that both bigfoot walked without locking their knees. ,NNW end of Three Lake Wildlife Management Area Keenansville  Florida Approx. 6 miles west on Williams Rd. then north 2.85 miles on Rd. #1.

871,The witness was driving to Cocoa around 11 am. He pulled over to relieve himself and found the tracks. The tracks were backed up to a large gate approx. 4.5 feet tall. It appeared to look as if the creature walked across Nova Rd. from west to east  stepped over the gate and continued east into a wooded tree line. There were 6 tracks in all covering about 30 feet of ground. After that the ground slooped down into a gully with weeds and water  then back up into the trees. The witness took 2 photos of the tracks. The tracks measured approx. 13 inches long by 8 1/2 inches wide. ,The prints were found on the east side of Nova Rd. just south of a small bridge  1 1/2 miles south of SR 520. ,Osceola,11,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12097,no
872,Well  on May 21st 1999 I was out in the woods in St. Cloud Florida armadillo hunting with a few friends. My good friend and I wandered off by ourselves and were exploring. As we were walking through the woods we saw what seemed to be a large extremly hairy creature. It stood about 7 1/2 feet tall and must have weighed about 350-400 pounds. It walked slowly with its arms hanging low and a hunched over back. My friend and I stood in amazement the creature slowly turned and stared at us for approx. 4 seconds  then turned back in its original direction and contiuned walking until it was out of sight. My friend and I quickly ran away and found the others and told them about our sighting...most did not believe us. ,St. Cloud Florida in the woods out by Holopaw.

873,Aug. 26 2011 This day was a Friday in August  Central Florida. In the pre-dawn hours of the morning my husband was not even half way on his commute from Space Coast to Disney World to report for his early morning shift  like he does 5 days a week.  He takes the 192 which involves a loooong stretch of road with seemingly no sign of life anywhere for about an hour until you reach the St. Cloud area.  My husband slammed on the brakes to try to avoid what was in the road without hitting it dead on  all the while trying to avoid flipping his Volkswagon Passat. Unfortunately  he could not avoid contact  and he struck the massive 9 Ft. Gator. He pulled the car over after attempting to resume driving  realizing the car was now undriveble. He made phone calls to the insurance company  his job  and me. I head out on the same stretch of 192 to retrieve him.  His vehicle is being loaded onto a flatbed and he is waiting with the tow truck driver who is nice enough not to leave him standing at the side of the road in the middle of nowhere at (now) 6 o  clock in the morning. I am driving  wide awake  looking the whole time for this piece of road kill.  I want a photo of it. No I am not morbid  but he said it was HUGE  and I take pictures of all wild animals I come across. Bunnies  snakes  gators  whatever.  I drive a long time  the sun is breaking over the line at the moment I finally come to the Gator.   It is daylight enough that I can drive without headlights and I can see outside very well. I see it up ahead in the distance  I see the Turkey Vultures. The BIG BLACK birds that come to eat the road kill.  My eyes are darting down to the road  up ahead the highway looking for the tow truck  back to the monstrous mess in the road.  I am slowing down so I can photograph the Gator  and I am reaching for my camera.  As my eyes follow a 3-pack of the large birds up off the road and cross over the the right  I see a man walk into the woods up ahead. He is up ahead a distance I would call a block. A block away.  He is wearing ALL BLACK.  His elbows are bent as he is walking   and he disappears into the woods. So I am pulling over now  snapping photos of the disgusting mound that is so large in the road that if it  s not cleaned up  and if someone hits that  there is going to be another accident. And I am fully awake and present in the moment.  I am running a checklist in my head.  Gator. Birds. Man. Man ?!?!  What Man? Why would a  man  be out here at (now) 7am exactly  walking around in the woods. There are cows here.  Lots of land you pass on this road has cattle being  raised for beef. Oh  and a DEER sign. A sign  just a moment back I passed   warning of Deer Crossing. (Thanks for the heads up on the 9 Ft. Gators).  So he  s tending to his cows?  A ranch hand? Where  s his truck? Where  s his Cowboy hat? . So I recall this again.  A man - in ALL black- no change of color for face or hands- Wearing a black hoodie? On a beautiful  warm  dry  summer morning- in August- in Central Florida? He  s not  looking  when  a car pulls up? He  walks into the woods that are headed nowhere?  I don  t think so.  Makes no sense.  I think I saw a Bigfoot. So it took me about 2 minutes to put this all together and I didn  t want to leave!  I wanted to go in after him.  I couldn  t. My husband was waiting and was all revved up from his climactic morning.  He would be angry if I delayed  goofing off. The tow truck driver had waited long enough. I snapped like 2 pictures of the mess in the road and quickly moved on. Putting this all together in the months since the event  it makes more and more sense that what I saw was a Florida Skunk Ape.  Of course he would be pulled out of the woods at the knowing of the HUGE road kill.  It was dark for more than an hour while that Gator sat there in the dark. There was time for a Bigfoot to hoof it on out there and check out the scene  hey  he even had enough time to pack a bag lunch. Nearly escaping unnoticed before the sun came up over the horizon. It has been almost a year  and I am planning to go back to said location and search for prints and evidence one day. I have driven by the exact location approximately 6 times since then. Each time going over and over it in my head.  I am so angry with myself that I had camera in hand  and came up empty.  But even driving in the passenger side with the camera hanging out of the window I can miss a pic of a deer!  Nothing could have prepared me to photograph a  hey--maybe that  s a  somethin      at a moment  s notice.  Meanwhile  since my incident I have heard of two other sightings in locations that are within 2 hours driving distance (east or south) of my incident.  I continue to search for new reports of local sightings and hope to make future trips to search for tracks.

874,Bigfoot have been living  and sleeping on my property here in FL  (known of since 1969). They do whistle signals  I used to hear them quite frequently. The last two sightings  within the past year(eyes on)  were by one of my grown sons  that thought the old timers here were telling  Booger-y stories   until he saw him. My neighbor and I went in search of  someone messing around in the wooded area . Long story short he ran towards the heavy footsteps (heard clearly on the leaves and brush)  thinking he was going to see a man. I stayed directly across from him (about 30 yards)  as he ran at what he was sure would be a man.  He found out differently as it ran with lightening speed. As it passed me  it looked like an 8 or nine foot tall flash as it ran past me in the moonlight. I always feel safe at night  because bigfoot beds close to the house near my bedroom window.  It looks like a deer bed  but 8-10 feet long. I haven  t seen him laying there  but I have been in the woods long enough to know what a  bedding area looks like ! He eats grapefruit off of the tree  sometimes leaving a large bite mark on a half of grapefruit (usually hanging three feet above my reach). ,Please do not post it online. I live in a wooded area  that used to be only 10 acres inhabited out of the surrounding 500 acres. There have been a male & female spotted on my dirt lane (that was about 30 years ago  when an Uncle saw them). I still believe there are more than one  because I hear the whistle signals. People I  ve told   commented  oh  they whistle too (said sarcastically-doubting Thomases) . I did not know that the whistles were signals until I watched your show tonight. Makes me feel alot better knowing that somebody besides me knows that they whistle. When my garden (200x100 feet) was still growing  lots of vegetables were missing. Now  if I leave vegetable and fruit scraps out  up high  it will eat them. ,Osceola,11,Florida ,FL,Unknown ,12097,yes

876,I saw a large two legged figure walk left to right across the road and a car was headed in its direction.  It doubled back and jumped a fence that was there.  I sped to where it was and there was a field it would have had to cross but nothing was there.  Amazing to see but none of my friends believe. ,Call me I  ll tell you everything ,Osceola,11,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12097,yes
877,These thing  s which we called skunk ape  s would come on our property at night and eat mango  s and other fruit. They would also sometimes come to the travel trailer and look in the windows as if they were curious. On one ocation they had picked up a 100 lb. hog out of the pen  bit three large bite  s out of it and spit it out. It was like he was taking out chunks to get to the liver. That  s all he ate of the hog. when they would come around we also noticed that the horses would go crazy! they appaerantly had came from the everglades looking for food. During this time there had been a large fire which had burned off a very lage part of the everglades! We susspected that the lack of cover had driven them into the rural areas in our vacinity and there had been many sightings. I saw the whole family of these creatures at one time! The first one I saw  I thought was a big one. I later realized that this must be the young one. It was about 7 ft. tall and had brown hair. Later  I meet up with  dad . He was huge  about 12 feet tall and had silver-gray hair. The  mom  was 8 to 10 feet tall with brownish-gray hair. They all had long arms  hardly any neck and man can they run fast. They stink real bad  too. We tried hunting these things  but it was like they were playing a game with us. At that time there was a big reward out for one of these things. We spent about a year hunting these things.  They are real intelligent. We even shot at them at close range and they would just rub the spot and look at us as if to say  Why did you do that ?. they would just turn and run away. Myself  wife  cousin and even a police officer witnessed these event  s and a nieghbor. I know this seem  s far fetched or unbelievable  but I swear this is the truth! I tried to report this back then  everyone thought that we were crazy! After that year  we didn  t see them any more. They probably moved back to the Everglades when it started growing back up. The closest I came to one of them was about a foot  I walked up on it. Thing is  they NEVER showed any aggression towards us  even after getting shoot at. We could always hear them outside at night chattering a lot. ,This location is somewhat rural.It is on the outskirts of Lkae Worth. It used to be a hog farm  and is somewhat secluded.

878,We were gonna go camping in the woods. It was a wooded area with a canal along one side that had a dirt pile next to it from digging out the canal. The dirt was high and very steep  almost straight upward. We were setting up the tents and I looked out into the open field that was about 100 yards away and saw a very tall  I  m not sure what to call it  thing running across the field. It stopped for about 30 secs and looked toward us and then ran straight up the dirt pile very fast to the top  stopped and looked again and ran away. This thing had no problem at all running up it. It was very tall  had long arms about to its knees. Had long brown hair all over it. It actually was very man-like but definitely not human I don  t believe. ,It was around where the turnpike meets PGA Blvd ,Palm Beach,3,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12099,yes
879,A friend and I had towed my canoe from Okeechobee to Lake Park to paddle the water catchment area EQQ. It was early morning before 8AM. We were told we had to rent a canoe and couldn  t go out by ourselves  had to go one a guided trip. I grew up in the area and had covered on foot  horse  swamp buggy  canoe  etc. But they ranger still wouldn  t let us go. So we walked the boardwalk and I looked out to the cypress heads and squatting down at the base of a cypress tree was a dark figure. It would dig a little in the mud at the base of the tree and stand up and put a hand to it  s mouth. I asked a Ranger for binoculars and she came out to look. The humidity was so high the binoculars fogged over and were useless. We watched the figure squat down and repeat  dig around  stand up and it did it over and over. Another Ranger came and my friend and I watched this motion for about five to seven minutes more then left. I have no idea how long the rangers watched it or if they saw it leave. If it turned out to be a bear that would thrill me too. No bears had been seen in Palm Beach County since 1979. But I  m sure it wasn  t a bear. It stood too straight and bent at the waist and squatted at the knees like a human. A Bear doesn  t bend the waist. I had forgotten about it until after I had a sighting in Okeechobee Co. I filed a report on the Okeechobee sighting and spoke with and went out to the area with an investigator. I  ve decided to report the first sighting because of the way Fish and Wildlife handled a sighting here in Columbia County  Fl where I now live. Big joke  lots of laughs. I take offense to that attitude. I  ve spent a life time in the swamps and woodlands of Florida  put in 12 years as a wildlife rehabilitator in Palm Beach County. It  s pretty safe to say I know what I  m looking at. My friend and I talked about the sighting in 2006 and she said if that  s what I thought we saw she was happy with it because she didn  t know what it was either. I should mention she is a Veterinarian nurse  pretty familiar with animals too. Since the second sighting I  ve been putting a lot of research into the subject and would like to discuss ideas with other people but haven  t found anyone to carry on a serious conversation with. Since the Finding Bigfoot program came on air and as more information comes out I hope to get past the jokers.

880,We were in an open field when we heard the creature first. It made sort of a howling/growling type of noise.We went towards the tree line where the sound came from. It was crouched down slightly and then stood up as we got close.It was about 8 feet tall. It then ran off  extremely fast  towards the swamp. We were all armed  but decided it would not be a good idea to follow it into the swamp. When we reached the spot  it was at  we noticed it had shreaded the bark off the tree it was behind. ,north central pasco county near crews lake.approx. 10 miles south of Pasco/Hernando   county line.

881,About 26 or 27 years ago when I was about 9 or 10 at the time and my sister was either 7 or 8  but we both remember exactly what we saw.  We shared a bedroom in the mobile home that we lived in.  The bedroom window was only about a foot wide and a foot tall and was only about one foot from the ceiling.  One summer night we both woke up with a feeling like something was watching us  and when we looked at the window we both saw a dark figure looking down at us through the window.  the thing that got us both was the red eyes that almost glowed in the dark.  We were so scared that neither of us moved a muscle until whatever it was left.  a couple of weeks later  my mother and I were sitting in the living room watching tv late at night when all of a sudden we both heard a loud bang and the mobile home shook.  the next day when we went outside to look  the middle of the back door had a fist print in it about half way up the door and it was bent in a little.  (it was a metal door.)  and there were big bare foot prints under the door.  the mobile home sat about three feet off the ground at that time  so the bedroom window alone had to be at least 8 feet from the ground. the last thing was in either December or January that winter  my sister and I were waiting at the bus stop to go to school  when we heard something in the palmetto bushes behind us.  We both turned around and saw a dark figure moving the palmetto bushes aside with it  s hand to look at us  then duck back down behind the bushes.  it did that for about 10 minutes or so until more kids started showing up at the bus stop  then we didn  t see it again.  Neither of us were brave enough at that time to go see what it was. ,about 40 miles east of Pasco county  and about 5 miles south of Hernando county.

882,my sighting happend in Land O Lakes Florida in July of 2006  It was around 10 30 at night and there was another car infront of us we were driving down parkway it has wooded areas on both sides one side being a 30k acre nature preserve. the other side bieng a 500 acre orange grove. we were following the car down the road to the nieghborhood 3miles away whenall of a sudden the car infront of us slammed on its breaks and we pulled up behind. and inour healights about 25yards infront of the truck there was manlike object walking acorss the two lane road it was about 8-9 feet tall and its arms went down to is kneecaps it was really dark but we could see almost all of its side. It also had a really strong musk we could even smell it after it was gone the bigfoot walked acorss the road and put its hand on a bob wire fence pole and broke off the top of the pole and walked over the fence and disappeared  we went back the following day and saw the fence post broke the bob wire fence bent like it may have been stepped on and and all the brush was broken down going into the woodline we didnt go any further thenthat. ,about 2 miles before pine view middle school facing ehren cutoff ,Pasco,8,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12101,yes
883,One day  my son and his friend ran out of the woods next to the house out of breath and scared.  They said they had seen  something big .  I asked them what color and my son said brown.  I assumed it was a deer or wild pig as there are many around  just told them to be careful  and brushed it off. A month or so later  there was a show about Bigfoot on TV and my son came to me and asked if there were Bigfoot in Florida.  I told him no and that they stay up North.  I didn  t want him to be scared of the woods.  I didn  t tell him about the Florida  skunk  ape sightings. About 6 months later  my neighbor called me to ask if I or my family had ever seen anything unusual in the woods.  I was sitting in the car with my son waiting for school to open.  My neighbor told me about the sightings he and others had last fall.  My son heard the conversation and started interrupting  telling me he saw it. My neighbor heard him over the phone and started giving me questions to ask.  Height?  Very tall  taller than parents.  Color?  Reddish brown.  Was there a bad smell?  Yes.  I asked him what did the ears look like  were they pointy  rounded or what?  He said he didn  t see any ears  just head and hair. My son and friend were playing in the woods when he saw something moving in undergrowth.  He saw the back of something that looked like it was on all fours.  As the back was large and tall  he decided to move closer to the house.  He felt very nervous.  As they were leaving  it seemed as if the something was moving toward them.  He also remembers sticks being thrown.  He urged his friend to move on.  Then at one point  he turned to look and he saw this large thing looking at him from behind a tree about 10 ft back.  It was standing up and very big  tall.  The tree was at least 2 ft in diameter yet it had wrapped one arm all the way around it.  There were many vines and branches on the trunk so he didn  t get a good look at the body  but he insisted it was standing on two feet  not hanging on the trunk.  He said the eyes spooked him.  He started running and his friend followed.  That is when I saw them coming out of the woods  all out of breath. I asked him why he didn  t tell me he saw Bigfoot when he came out of the woods  instead of saying something big.  He said that he didn  t know there was such a thing as Bigfoot.  Then when he saw the show on TV  he asked me if they were in Florida and I had said no.  So he filed it away until my conversation with my neighbor reminded him. ,At edge of Cypress Creek Well Field.  A 7 400 acre conservation area.

884,the date  3/5/2009 time  12 00AM Place  In Pasco County going down Gulf Trace towards US Highway 19. I was just going over the bridge close to the Holiday Recreational Center. Well just over the bridge the road curves slightly then straightens out  I had my high beams on like I always do when I pass a wooded area (I am a strong believer in Bigfoot) to try and catch a glimps of the sasquatch  Well that night it paid off! What I saw was a figure about 8 and a half to 9 feet tall and was hair covered  my light had made his eyes glare and he kinda squinted his eyes a little due to the light I am guessing. And I supposed I surprised it as it appeared to be just making its way walking out of the tree line towards the road and thats were I saw him  he stopped instantly when my light hit him (I saw him instantly  as well I slowed down)he backed up into the tree line more and just watched me in a seemingly very curious manner. at that point I had been stopped and due to the angle of my lights not being directly on him anymore  just the peripheral of my lights were on him  all I could see was from his shoulders up. I was speechless and for some reason I called out saying  Hi!  and at that point he backed up out of the light and I could hear running off into the woods. I stayed a few more moments and continued on my way. the entire incident from start to end only lasted about a minute thirty.

886,Around 2 or 3 am I was woken by a sound that I can only describe as a mixture of a whooping  screaming  howl. I have heard coyotes and bobcats and this was not anything like that. (In fact I did hear coyotes howling and yipping later in the evening) I patted my son on the leg and he responded in a whisper that he was awake and he heard it too; we laid there for several minutes and then we heard a whistling noise moving through the swamp around the perimeter of our camp. It was not like a bird it was almost like a human whistling a tune but much louder. The whistling lasted for several minutes. It was long drawn out whistles not just 2 or 3 seconds and then a pause. Another hour or so later I woke up again just in time to see a silhouette pass by the backside of the tent. ,Along the Florida National Scenic Trail in the West Tract of SWFMD  s Green Swamp Wilderness Preserve.

887,Early Saturday morning about 1 55am I went outside for a smoke before bed and it happened. I heard a clinking sound of the chain-link fence clinking on the bar-rail fence. At the very same time I heard the sound of the brush/bushes being smashed. I looked over in the direction of the sound and seen a leg hanging down. As I looked up I seen a large hairy back. The thing turned and looked right at me. Just after it made eye contact with me it pulled its leg right back up and over the fence. It actually used the bar of the top of the fence to leap back onto the brush/thicket area. It was huge  from what I could see. This is not my first encounter with what I believe was one. I was on a walk at around the same time of early morning a few months ago and actually felt something run by me on that same side of fence-row. As the thing ran by me I could feel the vibrations of it moving by me. It sounded like it was tearing through the thick brush with no problem at all. I didn  t report this before because I didn  t actually see it  only felt & heard it. However this time I know what I saw! No doubt in my mind. Even woke up my 25yr old daughter to come and try to see it. She heard it  and smelled it. ,It is a wooded area  with a small lake.

888,I just read one of these stories and I wanted to let you know about an incident that happened in the early fall of 1974. I still remember it clearly even though it has been 30 years.  It took place on the West side of Lakeland  Florida in Polk County.  This took place about 8 miles from the Saddle Creek area near Lake John which is at the end of Willow and Redwood Avenues. The area at that time was significantly more rural than today and there was wooded  swampy area nearby (the end of Cleveland Heights Golf Course).  I could show you specificaly on a map  but it was just northwest of Willow Ave.  We were sitting outside looking toward the northwest. The sun had just set. We heard wood being chopped or tapped just behind the house on the other side of the street. The sound was muffled- further away than the house.  We stood up and looked to see if we could see anything behind the house when something that looked like a very large upright monkey crawled up one of the pine trees and jumped to another one.  It looked around for a moment and jumped down; what must have been 20 feet. ,The south end of Cleveland Heights Golf Course just West of Willow Ave. ,Polk,36,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12105,yes
889,Just watched a TV show which made reference to the Skunk Ape/Bigfoot of Florida. As I have seen one  I was interested in learning if other sightings had occurred in the same area. While searching for this info  I came across your web site.  Even though my sighting was 30 years ago  I remember every detail as if it were yesterday. It was early morning (8-ish) New Years day 1978. My sister had picked me up at the Tampa ariport the day before. I was home on leave from the Army. We had spent the evening with friends in Lakeland and set out (6 30-ish) for Ona. We were driving south on Hwy 37 and had just started across a bridge over the Alafia River. In the passenger seat I had a clear view of the river. On the south side of the river  squatting at the edge of the water was a large dark haired skunk ape. He was splashing water over his shoulder. I yelled for my sister to stop the car as I opened the door to jump out. I ran to the bridge rail. He looked up at me. His features were more human than ape like. He stood up  seeming not afraid at all  looked at me for a moment and then turned and climbed up the bank into the woods. My sister saw him as he entered the woods and was concerned he would come onto the road after us  so we returned to the car and left. He was big  well over six feet  had a massive chest and arms  and was covered in shaggy dark hair. His face was not as hairy as his body. I did not feel threathened at all. , ,Polk,36,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12105,yes

891,Hello. i was reading the article the lady wrote from Polk County Fla.I was raised in Lakeland and grew up Hunting in the area around the County dump where the lady also lived or lives. I can tell you one thing you can beleive her.  There has always been something in the Swamps around that area. From the Tenneroc Mines thrue Saddle Creek all the way to The old mines around the dump. and also north of Polk City in the Green Swamp. I remember hog hunting or (poching)on the County landfill land and having the Hell scared out of me by something that was big/ loud /and smelly. And i even lost a couple of Dogs to what ever it is? I got a quick glance of something one night. I was traveling up the creek in a 10 FT.boat with two Dogs.About a quarter mile up the creek and i started hearing something that seemed to be following me on the bank to my right i thout maybe it was my imagination and then i started hearing a loud like blowing nouise then i started shining my light up the bank and the noise stoped then the Dogs started acting funny so i stopped thinking it may be hogs so i tried puting the Dogs on the bank and they started whining and would not go so i knew something wasnt right so I paddled back out and started feeling reel strange myself so i started to continue when my Bay Dog started barking madly then i turned my light on and shined up and down the bank then i seen a large Ape like thing go over the hill running away from me. It was to thick to get a good look so i was scared stiff then i got the nerve to turn and leave so i did. When i passed the area where i seen it i looked and seen a group of tracks i didnt stop to examine so i paddled my butt off till i got back to my truck and loaded up and left. ther is more to tell and me and some freinds did make a return trip. call for more info. ,North of 540 up the Saddlecreek about 1/2 mile up the creek on the right side in the swamp close to the Dump. ,Polk,36,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12105,no
892,I saw something  but I am unsure.  it was near the large park in bartow where they play baseball etc. We were on the top of the hill fishing and the others were checking the lines. There was something in the water staring at me very dark colored black looked hairy. I was in a trance and couldn  t move. It was stuck out of the water at least chest high not sure what it was. When the others came back I started telling them. I started to point to show them where I saw it and it was gone. I had sat there and stared at it even closing my eyes and then looking  again or averting my eyes and then looking it kept staring. Then it when the others showed up it disappeared. ,Go down 60 back toward mulberry over on the right hand side large car dealer ship there is a ball park down the road a bit.

893,It started last year when it was cool enough to sit around a fire. My husband  I and some nieghbors heard a growl or deep groan that we had never heard before coming from the woods behind our properties. The next night it was late. My husband and I were sitting around the fire and we heard what sounded like something large running and knocking down trees. My husband said   That was no hog or deer. They dont sound ike that.  We ran inside the house as it got closer to us. Later that week I heard our dog whinning and barking. I looked out the back door window and I saw it. It was standing at the fence line looking in the back yard towards the fire. It was the biggest scarriest thing I  ve ever seen. I quitely walked away from the window and took my dog with me  in fear that the barking would bring it in closer. I burried my head under my blankets. We told people about it and no one believes us. It seems the fire brings it in. This year we are having fires again already. Late at night about 12-2am sitting by the fires the noises are back. I would love for someone to come and see if they can find this thing. It is very swampy behind us. You can literally get lost back there. Description of it  About 8-9   tall  Reddish brown colored hair  hairy all over  arms that literally hung to the knees and it stood slightly crouched. It was as if it was observing us. When it comes around there  s a very pungent smell. Almost like a combination of dirty swamp water and a skunk. It  s eyes are very dark almost empy looking. Width of it  s body was about 4   give or take. If it ain  t a bigfoot... please tell me what it is! ,[Edited - Near the border of Polk and Hillsborough Counties] ,Polk,36,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12105,yes
894,I have not had a sighting of him yet but I do have a picture of a foot print and we have heard howls and knocks. I have been hesitant to contact you over the little stuff but tonight took the cake. It was about 6 30 PM and my husband and I were getting ready to grill some meatloaf.  My husband asked me if I had put corn out for the deer and hog.  I told him  no  why dont you go ahead and do it now .  He went to the shed and as he came out we smelt the worst of smells. It was like something was dead like a swamp rat. He asked me do you smell that  I was like oh my God yes  it stinks really bad.  He told me go get my gun. I ran in the house and got the 38 special that we keep.  I brought the gun to him.  I went in the house to get my shoes and by the time I came back out there were three large knocks or bangs on the side of the shed.  He dropped the corn and turned toward the shed and trees and backed out of the area really fast.  He said   Steph  you know I dont scare eaily  but that scared me so bad it made my hair stand up on ends.   Well we looked around and didnt see anything but we didnt go behind the shed because it is wooded against it. He left to go to the store and it wasnt even 5 minutes he was gone that my oldest son and I heard sounds over the tv set. I muted it and you could hear it plain as day.  It sounded as if it was shuffling along in the gravel or something and breathing funny.  Then eventually all you could hear were the branches breaking. I had been wondering why the hog and deer hadnt been coming in  would that be the case? My son  I and my dad prior to all of this had been sitting outside enjoying the cool night when we heard noises. We quit talking and listened. It was faint howls and knocks. This lasted from about 8 to 11 Pm. Also  there have been a few other incidents of smells and sights here.  My dad was staying here for a few months and he went to walk his dog like any other night.  Well Zeus wouldnt go  so he dragged him.  No sooner he got around back of the camper trailer he said he saw him.  He said Zeus bout ripped his arm off trying to get back into the trailer. Another time my 2-year-old was playing just off of the steps. I was inside sitting in my chair so that I could see him.  When all of a sudden he screamed at the top of his lungs and about killed hisself trying to run up the steps and get into the house. On the way up all he kept screaming is monster.  He knows the difference a deer and a hog  after all he sees them all the time.  To this day you cannot get him to go off the porch by hisself and he afraid of the fence line. You see we have about 7 acres of swamp behind us that we own.  Our whole neighborhood has a lot of swamp and lakes.  I want to venture into the swamp with someone to see if I can find anything.  I know he  s out here it is just a matter of time. I have spoken to one of my neighbors about any strange sitings and she said she has had one  but she dont talk about it because everyone thought that she was crazy. She told me about it.  She said she had gone outside just after dark to go to the nieghbors house at the time and there he was standing across the neighbor  s driveway across the street. She said as fast as she saw it  it was gone. ,[Near Lake Wales; Specific directions to property removed] ,Polk,36,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12105,yes
895,I went to a hunting spot to see what was happening  just around the time the sun was getting low. I arrived at a spot that i knew had a persimmon tree to see if i could see any deer in the area  about 15 minutes after arriving i noticed an animal standing up and getting persimmons and going back to the ground about 75 yards away  i thought this was a bear. I watched it for about 20 minutes and was getting ready to leave because it was starting to get dark. Just as i was getting ready to stand up and leave this animal did just that  stood up and left. I watched it get up on two legs and walk away  i observed this for at least 40 yards and it disappeared into the thick growth. ,Exact directions omitted. ,Polk,36,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12105,yes
919,I never saw it ...But I heard it and it was an experience I will never forget as long as I live! I was living at The Everglades Institue (on Loop Road  across from that old gas station that is where the road used to get really bad). This where the old town of Pinecrest used to be located in the thirties.  Al Capone ran a speakeasy and gambling joint in the area at that time.  I was walking on the path that makes its way around the pond at E.I.  There were five geodesic dome cabins around the pond.  It was just after 10 PM.  My cabin was number three. It was pitch dark out  with no moon  and there was twisted jungle and you can imagine that kind of plant growth if you  ve been to the Glades. I became aware of something way off to my right of the path I was walking to my cabin I heard scattered footfall noises.  Twigs breaking.  I didn  t think anything of it.  There are deer all over the place there  so it was no big deal to me at first. However  when I stopped to listen.  The noises stopped. I would start to walk and they would resume.  Each time I would begin to walk  and the noises resumed BUT MUCH CLOSER EACH TIME. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. DEER DON  T DO THAT!  They prance away  they don  t come closer! Now what still amazes me  and what was most peculiar about was happening to me then was   How can anything move so quickly through that undergrowth ...  I mean  you know  it didn  t make sense.  And no person could pull a trick like that  you  d poke your eye out on a sharp branch. After the third time I had stopped ...and resumed walking  the noise was very close. Less than twenty feet away I remembered thinking to myself.  I also had noticed the noises of the footfalls were widely spaced apart ...parallel but yet on an intersecting tract. I yelled at it like you would yell at a rogue dog that was menacing you  all the while walking that much faster ...In a couple seconds I realized this wasn  t working and that  s when I panicked and ran as fast as I could back the way I had come. It was only 300 feet back to a clearing behind the director  s mobile home trailer  and I know I covered the distance faster than any Phys. Ed experience that I might have had in High School but it followed me so closley I could hear its breathing and it was coming from above my head and twenty feet or so in back of me. I never looked behind me  and as I hit the clearing I was sure it was going to take me down. But I guess the light scared it from the trailer at the other end of the clearing.  The field wasn  t lit up ...but I became relieved as I became aware it was dropping back ...and at one point it ran back into the woods loudly and the scattered noises it made in the thicket were just a few and then nothing  no sound.I felt it was watching me from just out of sight. I told the director and he went out with his .44 magnum ...and shot off a few rounds. It took an hour for me just to go back outside  so maybe it left while he was dismissing the incident over his theory it was a jaguarundi  or someone  s pet cougar that got away  and went wild. Big cats growl  and this thing that breathed like it did was no cat.  This thing was a foot taller than a man because the breathing noises I had heard were definately well above my head and I  m 6 feet tall! What I experienced that night was many  many  many more times frightening ...than you can ever imagine.  My only real regret was that I didn  t have a shared experience with a friend who could vouch for what happened. I did not feel this creature is benevolent  or passive like you might read about in other stories.  Maybe that is because the area of the occurrence is close to an overflowing human population that might have disgusted the creature toward man in some way during its life.  Maybe it was wounded  or molested in some way.  I would have to say this  thing  was  definitely NOT friendly! It was stalking me no doubt. ,Take US 41 (Tamiami Trail ...is known as S.W. 8th St.) out of Miami forty miles.

922,May of 2013 I am a wildlife photographer and at this point had photographed just about every animal in Florida with the exception of the endangered Florida Panther. My goal was to go primitive camping in the Big Cypress region of the Florida Everglades while hoping to photograph a Panther. My very first day was a success.  I had ridden my mountain bike several miles at approximately 9 30-10 30 am.  A quick early rain shower let up and I road off to look around to see what this area would yield in the way of tracks  etc.  I road past a female panther and didnâ€™t have a clue she was just off the road in the Palmettoâ€™s that lined the edge of the road.  I stopped a thousand foot away or so and there she was as I looked back  standing in the middle of the road of which I just passed peering in the opposite direction. I went back and followed her quietly until she exited the road to my left and back into the thick swamp like area.  I eventually was blessed enough to take over 100 photos of her as I had waited for her to possibly exit just a few hundred feet further down the road. She came to me as I was hiding behind a power pole.  She eventually crossed over towards me and I left.  I photographed 2 panther (an approx. 160lb male & 100lb female)  3 black bear  a bobcat and a 13 foot aggressive alligator in the middle of the road and numerous snakes and other alligators.  I camped in my location for 9 nights and left the 10th day early.  I felt it was sure enough the right time to leave.  I was 23 miles out and the only camper at this location. On the 8th night  a bear or something entered my site and ransacked the empty water bottles in the designated fire pit.  I exited my tent and shined my light towards the pit and didnâ€™t see anything and soon went back into my tent to try and get some rest. On the 9th evening at 9 30  I had just finished reading my bible and turned the LED lantern off.  As I laid on top of my sleeping bag and ready to get some sleep  a tree had fallen 20 feet or so in front of my tent with an extremely huge thud  or so I thought it was a tree.  I waited for a few minutes while I listened intently and then I heard the palmetto fronds swoosh open as something exited them and stood just 15 foot or so on my right side of the tent.  It then whistled like a human would (typical dog calling whistle) and another answered it back to my left side.   This happened twice and then stopped. I knew it was not like any other bird call or animal I have ever witnessed in the wilds.  Never heard a bird or animal that sounded like mankind while photographing in the woods.  Within a minute  the thing walked up behind my tent and gave a guttural growl of sorts. I wasnâ€™t going to stick my head or flashlight outside to see what it was either.  I prayed to God for protection and I simply was frightened enough to think myself into denial and went to sleep.  No  I didnâ€™t smell anything and it didnâ€™t touch my tent either  and no tracks could be found because of the grass that covered the hard limestone.  The limb that snapped was only about 5 inches in diameter and 15 or so feet off the ground.  I looked at the limb and area the next morning and realized something large had fallen making the sound of a fallen tree.  Time to vacate. I went back with a close friend and he and I never saw another panther or bear or a bobcat for that matter.  We did discover one man that had been frightened by something that he described being as large as a moose.  His tent was vacated.  He said the thing was at least 7 or so feet tall hiding behind bushes just staring at him one night.  It startled him so bad  his truck was now his refuge.  No telling what it was. I have heard things (noises) in the woods that no other animal in Florida make.  Growls  knocks and running on two feet through swamps.  I am hoping to get a photo of whatever it/they might be. ,Black Bear Island  Campsite #4 ,Monroe,23,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12087,yes
923,On December 2014 I was out hunting with my nephew in Big Cypress National Park. We entered the hunting area into Monroe station  we walked the trail that day and there  s an open field pass on the trail to the right. We cut through the open field it was a very nice day but we didn  t see any game. We were there till 6 pm between 6 pm and 615   we were heading out through the middle of the field towards Tamiami trail to cut through the woods onto the trail. It was still good light out  just before we entered the woods my nephew decides to go across the other woods to see the other side of the field while I wait for him. I was out in the open  I was away from the tree line about 60 yards. I noticed a movement from the distance when I look it was walking big steps right where we had hiked  from what it seemed like it was following us in the distance. I was really scared  I started shouting for my nephew. But wouldn  t get my eye off of it. It stood behind a tree moving its head gently side too side looking at me. I was gonna point at it with my rifle too see it through my scope but I didn  t because at the same time I thought what if its a ranger on a ghille suit? I didn  t want to point at him with my rifle. My nephew came running when he got to me he told me did you see that in the woods. I told him no  look at where I  m looking and tell me my eyes aren  t playing tricks on me. He looked  and looked at me  cocked his gun and we ran into the woods to cross over to the trail. By the time we got to the trail running it was night fall. Luckily there was a man in a buggy with his wife. And gave us a ride out...what I saw was approximately 4 street blocks away. Its head was kinda square  its arms would hang down about where I thought its knees would be. ,It  s the trail on Monroe station in big cypress.

925,yesterday 11/11/08  i was kayaking on the yellow river in north west fl panhandle  when i heard a vocal moan to a yell   got on down the river smelled a very musky wet dog smell   i heard sticks breaking   but not as much as you would think  then the big stuff happened out of nowhere a big rock come flying out of the trees and hit the water   i thought its got to be a redneck or some thing so i yelled out hello what are ya doing no sounds not even birds then another rock about the size of my head almost hit my kayak  that set off a bunch of coyotes they were on something then a sound so loud it scared me then trees breaking and then a dog or coyote screamed like it was in pain   barking yellping and some sound that i cant identify  they were fighting i think . the river trip was 25 miles long and it sounded like i was followed the whole way. dont know what that was but i thought yall might be interested . never saw it . but heard it and smelled it and got rocks thrown at me it was scarrey  to say the least ,on the yellow river bout 10 miles down past hwy 2 bridge ,Okaloosa,8,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12091,no
926,A large blackish - brown figure walked out from behind a clump of trees along the eastbound side of I-10.  It stepped out from behind the bushes  looked at traffic then ducked back down into woods. UPDATE from witness Randy K. I have had a sighting in this same area  on the East bound lane of I-10. I have submitted a detailed report [see report #63433] and have discussed with one of your researchers. This creature matches somewhat the published reports of the same area  that being near the Crestview exit. What I saw was impossible to fake with a costume. The creature was approx. 8 feet tall and had obviously articulated muscles as it moved from the edge of the road  down a gully and into the tree line. The movement  particularly down a deep slope and up the other side would make it almost impossible for a human in a suit to accomplish. There was an additional car with witnesses. I do not wish to have my identity published as I am a current state government official with past time in a law enforcement agency. I am available to discuss further in confidence. ,Milepost 45 eastbound I-10 around 10 30am ,Okaloosa,8,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12091,yes
927,NW Florida  March 22  2013. Me and my brother were driving South (me behind the wheel) on Hwy 85 about 7 miles south of Crestview Florida at 1 30am when we spotted what at first we thought was a really big black bear on the side of the road (West shoulder) next to the woods. I decided to make a U-turn at the next open medium to get a better look as big bear sightings in this area are not all that common; Usually they are very small black bears. We took a U-turn at an open medium about a 1/2 mile from the initial sighting and started heading back North. We got to the point where we had first seen what we thought was a large bear and started looking across the median for it. My Brother looked to his right and spotted the thing that we had seen. It had apparently crossed the highway putting it now on the East side of the road. When we looked we saw a large upright walking (like a human) black big foot type of creature. It paused  looked like it turned its head toward us  and ran into the woods. It was too large to be a human and it definately was not a bear. I  d guesstimate approx. 8   6  to 9   tall. ,Approx. 6 or 7 miles South of Crestview Florida on Hwy 85 on the West shoulder  then again on the East shoulder.

928,My daughter attends the University of West Florida and I had just finished getting her settled in her dorm room  stocked up on groceries and other essentials. I left in the late morning to head back home which is East of Pensacola some three plus hours. All through the first hour or so there were tremendous rain bands like we are used to here in Florida. As I was traveling on Interstate 10 the trailer trucks would put up a literal fog of water spray so I wasn  t going more than 50 mph. As I got out of the last rain band the sky got brighter and brighter to the point where I could get back up to 70 mph. I was still following a car at about 10 car lengths. I checked the rear view and no traffic behind and I remember looking around the car ahead and nothing for some distance. I was just about ready to pass the white car when he put on his brakes and I closed distance to him fairly quickly. I braked also not knowing what was ahead of him - maybe a truck tire carcass and he could swerve into my lane as I pass him. Even though I am driving a p/u truck I ride a motorcycle and sort of drive like I ride  very defensively. As I slowed I noticed some movement off the road  we were both in the right lane. On the other side of the guard rail something caught my eye. We had just come over either a swampy area or a small creek so there was a guard rail over that area. Still there was a gully between the guard rail and the tree line  maybe 20 feet deep. Almost instantly I thought bear but wrong color. Our bear here are jet black and if they stand and you have the rare chance to see that  they aren  t very tall. In the next thought I had was man in a gillie suit but wrong again. This was not material. It was hair! Matted down  wet hair. And the height  maybe 8 feet. It was huge. So as I saw it  by this time I was almost stopped  the car ahead directly abeam of the creature and stopped or very slow. What I saw was a living creature  everything articulated perfectly  head  arms  and legs. I had a profile to a back view of it  saw its muscles in the upper back. The color wasn  t exactly uniform but varied between shades of chocolate brown. The head looked rounded. I couldn  t see ears or a neck but it definitively had a head and looked down before stepping into the gully. At that time I saw arms that moved but really saw the separate legs and saw what was matted hair stuck together from the leg. It stepped down  rounded the gully and out the other side to go into the tree line. Its motion was very smooth  almost like it was gliding. So even if a man could don a suit and act like an eight foot tall living creature  how did he manage to walk down a steep embankment that was grassy and wet? Any human would be on his ass or tumble dangerously down that embankment. Anyway I hurriedly called the wife who laughed at me for a minute or two but then realized I was serious. She said get the license plate of the car (which I didn  t) and where are you. I was surprised that I hadn  t done all that. Frankly I think I was dazed. Well I know there is someone else that saw this thing. But that is about all. I would estimate this thing weighed about 4-500 pounds  it wasn  t fat or barrel chested. It wasn  t skinny either like it didn  t have enough to eat. It was healthy and athletic in appearance and it sure covered a difficult area in no time.

929,My husband and I were sitting in the woods hunting in northern Florida  about an hour from Alabama. We were sitting in the brush and heard a loud crunch  thinking it was a big buck  when my husband and I turned to look about 80 yards out we see a massive human like figure that was covered in meduim longish brown hair looking from behind a large oak tree at the end of a bottom  towards the entrance of a branch head. About 30 minutes later we heard another load crunch and right behind a pine tree we looked and another 80 yards out heading towards the bottom we see the same large hairy human figure turning and heading deeper into the creek bottom. ,Go up 85 north and turn down an off road towards Duke Field.

930,Went on a afternoon hike and decided to stop at the clear cut where big powers lines are to see if I could see a deer or something. I jumped up numerous turkey and deer while hiking. So I parked the car  rolled down the windows  shut the car off and just listened and watched. Not even 10 mins go by and this large black thing just starts walking across the open all the way to the other side. I get out of the car to get closer to see it  soon as I do that it seeâ€™s me then steps into the tree line . I hurried back to my car and watched from the cab. I called an individual and on the phone with them while Iâ€™m still watching it. At first before I started recording I noticed it and for a second I thought a hiker or hunter. But itâ€™s posture and how it moved didnâ€™t look right. To me it looked hunched over or like itâ€™s shoulders weâ€™re rolled forward. I showed a buddy and he agrees with me so idk. Found a dismantled deer very close by. Head was missing and front legs were ripped off. Their was a document sighting on BFRO about 1 mile or so from here.

931,I think I may have had a encounter the other day while me and 2 of my friends were hunting for wild hog on the yellow river WMA. We were in some super thick pine wood area that had a ton of hog sign which was right by the river and swamp area. We had just found a big sign of uprooted area from hog and we decided to sit for a second and see if we could hear anything. After a few minutes we heard a pretty big limb snap and I saw what I thought was a buzzard fly off  so not sure if it was the buzzard that snapped the limb or the result of the tree snapping which spooked the buzzard into flying off. A few minutes after that I heard what sounded like a person slamming a baseball bat in a tree 3 times (knock knock knock) very loud from around 100-150ft away and about 5 seconds after that another (knock knock knock) which sounded around 300-400 yards away. Our initial thought is that it was other hunters possibly taking down a tree stand since itâ€™s the end of the season. With us thinking it was other humans we walked through the dense woods to the road and expected to see a truck parked along the side of the road on our way back to my truck. We did not see a single othe vehicle the walk back (and even drove  the opposite way and no cars). And thereâ€™s no way given the location in the terrain that you could get to this spot other than by car. I know what woodpeckers sound like and unless the woodpecker was the size of a Pterodactyl it was not that. The first set of knocking was so loud there was no way it was anything I am familiar with. Given the fact there was no other cars in the area I honestly do not know what else could have made those noises. ,It occurred in yellow river WMA. I can give GPS coordinates on exact location.

932,I was driving south east on US Hwy 441 North between Ft. Drum and Okeechobee  Florida on Jan. 18  2004. It was almost dusk  approx. 5 30 PM. There was only one other car on the road and it was several miles away in the west bound lane coming at me ( two lane road). I took this opprotunity to remove my sun glasses. A spring type clip on which I need both hands to remove. I turned my head and dropped them in my purse on the seat next to me. As I looked up toward my rear view mirror a flash of movement caught my attention. It happened so fast all I saw was the last few steps of a small hominid running across the road in front of me. It wasn  t close but I  m not sure how far away. It stopped on the edge of the road for a split second and made a leap over the roadside ditch and a barbed wire fence. I tired to reason I had seen a limpkin or a sandhill crane but knew it wasn  t. I braked as soon as I saw the first movement and slowed to 20 mph by the time I thought I was where it had leaped into the bushes. I couldn  t see any bushes moving or water movement. I was so intent on looking at the side of the road I didn  t think to look into the pasture on the other side of the barbed wire. If I had been sure in my mind I had seen a wading bird I wouldn  t have slowed as I see them all the time. I knew in my heart it was something different from what I  d ever seen before. I have reported this to the Mysterious Encounters web site and have thought more on it and will now revise my estimates of it  s size. I judge it to be 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall and between 75 and a 100 pounds. It had a very round head on an upright body no neck to speak of. The hair was long and silky not matted or tangled. It was a brownish red  more light brown than red. I  m sure it had it  s head turned away from me and I was seeing the back of it  s head as I didn  t see any facial features. I remembered seeing it  s foot later. It was like a person of color whose skin is darker than the sides of their feet. The hair hung lightly over the sides of the edges of it  s foot. I saw one arm and it reached almost to the knee.  When it leaped it didn  t swing it  s arms out or bend it  s knees to jump it just leaped flat footed  pushing off. The distance it leaped was approx. 20 to 25 feet. Seeing it bothered me and then I saw the Redwood Giant episode of Mysterious Encounters  Jan. 24  on OLN. A man on the show said a three foot tall hominid ran in front of his car in NC. It hit me like a shot  I knew what I had seen then. That  s when I filled out the report form on their web site. I did a Google search tonight and found your site. The more I  ve thought about it and talked with my family ( after they stopped laughing) we have come up with other times we could have been in the presence of these hominds over the years. Once two years ago my son and I were on the Kissimmee River  the western boundry between Okeechobee County and Highlands County  Florida. We heard a call...scream.. yell  from a distance. After discussing it my son said it must have been a big bellied redneck out hunting or a skunk ape  we laughed it off but kept a watch around us the rest of the day. It was very disturbing. A year a go a friend and I were on the board walk of the Grassy Waters Preserve on North Lake Blvd in northern Palm Beach County  Fl. It was early morning and we were walking to the end to go into the little nature museum and looked out across the water and sawgrass toward a cypress head. Standing in plain sight was a BIG dark figure. It would bend over and do something in the water at the base of a cypress tree  then stand up and act like it was eating something. This went on for quite a while  bend over- stand up. The woman who was in charge of the museum came out with a pair of binoculars but they were so badly fogged we couldn  t make out details. Just a big homind figure. There are many more times and incidents I could relate but they go back to the mid 1970  s. So I will stick with the present. ,The hominid ran across hwy 441  the location was maybe a 1/3 the distance between Ft. Drum and Okeechobee. I would rather not put the location on the site for fear the locals will go and try to hunt it. There have been reports of a panther and somet took to the woods with guns. Several years ago an escaped or released python was sited and some people wouldn  t rest until the had killed it. That  s the mentality around here. ,Okeechobee,2,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12093,yes
933,I grew up on a pretty good piece of property that was backed up to a pretty good amount of acreage of swampland. My brother  dad and I always went to the back pasture where we would play in the pond which connected to the swamp. we had a pretty good dry season one year an we went back to the pond to see how bad the water had gone down and noticed very large tracks of some sort  as we were approaching the pond first thought was one of the cows had walked through but as we got closer they were human foot tracks but abnormally very large tracks. My dad had a tape measure in the truck we drove to the pond we measured the tracks an they were approximately 29 to 30 inches in length. I  m not sure how big Bigfoot tracks usually are but I  ve never seen anyone with feet that big. My dad said that it was people tracks but I beg to differ. I  m not sure on how wide they were but my guess was that they were around 10 inches wide. I know when you get reports like this people exaggerate some and even a lot but I  m a 1000% sure on what i saw I  ve never seen anymore tracks after that  Since my brothers and I are in the woods a lot hunting and I  ve never seen anything like it. I  ve heard strange noises in the woods and in the swamp that I couldn  t explain or even could possibly mimic but who knows could be anything. Also this wasn  t the only encounter that I  ve had  It was a couple years ago me and a buddy of mine always hog hunt in the woods on the back side of our neighborhood with his parents. We decided to go for a walk to a little slew we had found while hunting. We gotten about 100 to 160 yards into the tree line the moon was full so the woods came alive. As we got on to the game trail  I noticed something in the palmettos among the oak trees. I told him to stop and get down and be still that I think i see a big hog by the oak tree about 30 yards off the game trail 50 yards ahead of us. He spotted the figure by the tree and we began to watch it. The figure never moved so we stood up to keep moving. When we did it quickly stood up and quickly moved behind the tree we just froze and watched to see if whatever it was would come out of hiding. As we were watching the tree we heard something heavy footed walking around the pepper trees off to the side of us  my friend freaked out and took off running out of the tree line toward the houses. I had no choice to follow after him because I did not wanna stay to find out what it was by myself. As I turned to run I seen a tall figure through the pepper trees  I didn  t stop to see what it was but it was huge and wasn  t on all fours as I reached the fence. I heard a low gurgle sounding exhale come from the trees  my first thought was a bear but I have never seen or witnessed a bear in Florida. Of course they are here but I  ve never heard of anyone seeing a bear in the town i lived in  but it was bigger than any bear I  ve seen. I lived in Montana for a few months and have seen bears  monstrous black bear to be specific but i am 98% it was not a bear I  m not taking out the possibility that it was  but i couldn  t see it being one. ,First incident was located in Okeechobee off of Hwy. 98 near the the Kissimmee River near a state park and a few hunting preserves in a place called Basinger.

934,While waiting (not knowing my son had been injured and was taken to Orlando Hospital) I was inside the camper and had lowered the tent flaps slightly to allow air flow. The opening would have been approx. 7 feet off the ground.  I suddenly heard the loudest breathing right outside the opening. I became very frightened and screamed   get out of here! . Just about that time a ranger pulls in with my husband and son.  The shock (I fainted) of seeing my son made me forget this incident. We are huge BFRO fans. After watching stories of sightings  my memory was jarred. This thing had to be 7 or 8 feet tall and huge. After recalling this  I don  t believe I would camp there again.  My grandson encouraged me to file this report as we have been reading the BFRO website reports.

935,After watching several episodes of your show on Animal Planet  I decided to tell my story; I am actually getting goose bumps thinking of it. This happened in Orlando  Florida around the early 2000â€™s   we lived in a suburban area but around it has a heavy forest area and this was before any of the major shopping centers and housing were built. My cousin had come up for the weekend from Miami to hang out  we were probably in our second year of high school. I remember it was around 2am to 4am and we were driving home and before our entrance to our neighborhood there is a small lake with a patch of forest in the middle of it  and across from it there is the neighborhood playground and a daycare which was pretty dark at that time so my cousin decides to pull in by the playground to smoke a cigarette. So the lake was across from us and the carâ€™s front was facing the playground  I stayed in the car and my cousin was leaning on his side of the car. After a bit my cousin starts frantically trying to open his door which I donâ€™t know if it got locked and he left the keys in the ignition or the door doesnâ€™t open from his side  so I look in the rear view mirror and there standing is this huge dark figure ( here comes the goose bumps again) standing there  in the dim light you can see the fur texture and the muscles  so I turn around and look through the window and I see it just standing there like if it was shocked to see us there and I remember as soon as I opened the door and my cousin  started the car it took off to the right and we hauled butt to the left towards our neighborhood.  When we got to the entrance of our neighborhood we decided to go back towards where it was heading and of course we couldnâ€™t find no trace. I can still picture the figure plainly and right now I feel the tingling of goose bumps as I am thinking of it. We didnâ€™t tell anybody about the incident and being that young we wouldnâ€™t think people will believe us anyway  its just crazy our something like that can stay planted in your mind after so long so clearly  but I just wanted to let you guys know my story  keep up the awesome work with the show and the research. ,Waterford Lakes  Orlando Fl 32828 ,Orange,14,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12095,yes
936,I was kayaking with a friend in econlockhatchie river in orange county the east side of orlando fl it was 2003 early spring or very late winter my friend was much slower than me so I was having fun suprising these very large alligators that were sunning them selves in the early morning sun.The river is very narrow and has tight winding corners which allowed me to pop around a corner and to my delight most of the time a huge gator would slip into the river silently I would glide over the spot thinking that gator has to be lurking on the bottom.Anyway The wind was light out the west very dry and cool a real treat for a floridian I paddled a ways on a strait with the wind blowing from the woods to the water when I smelled such a strong overwhelming oder musty thick moist pugent smell I never experienced before I looked to see what on eart could it be when I saw big patch of long flowing fur it was shiny and light brown and moving fast then this animal crashed through the woods with so much force that small trees were popping and snapping as it ran away from me and the river then that smell was lingreing over the area and was so strong I finnaly held my breath and had paddle to get some fresh air.I had heard that bigfoot smelled like that but I had no idea they had been reported in fl.Anyway I had watched monster quest for years and not one person ever mentioned the smell I only remember it from seventies on tv when i was very young I never reported this til now because I felt  stupid and confused then after watching tonights episode where 2 different reports described that same smell I felt compelled also the location seemed very odd orlando fl just seemed too odd but internet searches showed many reports ,ecolockhatchie river off st rd 50 between 2 spots where we drop the kayaks then drive 2 cars then drive back so we can float down stream and drive back so we dont have to paddle up stream then float back to the same spot where we parked the car get to see more of the river ,Orange,14,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12095,yes
937,I moved to a small  rurual area outside of Orlando  FL (from Missouri)just a few months ago and I  m still learning my way around the area.  Subsequently  my wife and I often drive around on the weekends to get better familiar with our new home town. Today  (Saturday Sept 2  2006) we struck off to go to a shopping mall called Waterford Lakes and it was en route to the mall that I saw something peculiar. My wife was driving today  so I was relaxing looking out the passenger side window at the various swampy patches that are so common in central Florida and I must confess that I  m always looking for wildlife. My wife teases me because she knows that I  m primarily looking for aligators and thinks that it is such a  tourist thing  to be doing. However  on a couple of occassions I  ve actually spotted aligators sunning themselves  as well as numerous deer and turkey  so I feel justifed enough to keep looking. Well  we were traveling south on the Florida Turnpike and just saw a sign for the Ocoee exit when off to my right I saw a man walking in a very swampy & rugged section of meadow about a hundred yards to the right of the turnpike. As he was going in the same direction as we were heading  I was able to watch him for about 5 to 10 seconds and really didn  t think too much about him other than he was pretty gutsy to walk in that area all by himself  considering that he seemed to walk with an odd gait. Another strange thing was that he seemed to be dressed in all brown from the head down to his knees (the tall grass covered his lower legs  so I can  t say if this guy was wearing shoes or socks). Please note  this took place at about noon  on a very clear Florida day and I believe that the temp was about 93 degrees  so seeing a guy walking around such an area without a hat  or short sleeved shirt is unusual. Well  by this time we passed the fellow and I kept looking off to the right to see where he might ultimately be headed  but for the next few miles all I saw was more swamp and grass. As I stated  my wife was driving and didn  t see the man  but I was talking with her about it as it happened and she asked me a few questions (she thought he was probably homeless). When I started describing the man to her  I started to question whether or not the  fellow  I saw was necessarily human.  For example  either his hair was very  very bushy  or this guy didn  t have much of a neck.  Actually  his head looked a little pointed. He must have been fairly big  because I could clearly see him even at 100 yards distance  yet try as I might  I couldn  t identify a single article of clothing on him. Finally  I couldn  t even confirm his skin color  because I literally only saw dark brown over his entire body  including his hands. I must confess  I  d be thrilled to think I might have seen a bigfoot  but I just don  t know because my first thought was that this is just some poor idiot who was going to pass out from the heat in the wilderness.  But on reflection  I think could be wrong. One thing I can say for sure is that he didn  t seem frightening or monsterous in anyway.  I would imagine a bigfoot encounter to be much more exciting than this.  However  I was at a very safe distance and in a moving auto  so I might feel differently if I met him on foot.  Any thoughts?  ,Feel free to post  but also let me know what you think I may have seen. ,Orange,14,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12095,yes
938,This occurred southeast of Orlando. I was attending an on-site meeting for a new construction project in a very remote and undeveloped area southeast of Orlando. During the meeting  I kept noticing movement in the trees about 150 to 200 yards to the east of our group. I started to pay more attention  and began to realize that this was not a person or animal that I had seen before. It was far too large. It seemed to be ducking in and out behind the trees watching us. It never made a sound and after a couple of minutes  it turned and walked away on two legs into the thicker vegetation. After the meeting  I walked over to the area where I last saw it and the undergrowth was crushed down and you could see where something had passed through. I went to the last tree I saw it at and compared to the limbs on the tree  this thing was at least 7.5 to 8 feet tall. I am 6  2  and could barely reach the limbs that were at the same height as this creature  s head. No one else in the group seemed to notice and I didn  t say anything as we were in a high profile professional meeting and I did not want to draw attention to the fact that I thought I was seeing a bigfoot. It would not have been a good thing for my employment situation. I have returned to the area several times as construction has continued  but I have not had any other sightings of this creature. ,The area is widely cleared and under heavy development now. It is adjacent to an extremely large area of undeveloped land so the creature could easily remain hidden if it chose to do so.

939,We were out driving looking for a bigfoot sighting  and after driving for over an hour we had one. It was in east Orlando  fl near Ft. Christmas Florida on Fort Christmas Road and went down a smaller road and were driving looking and it ran out from behind a tree something very large. One of the guys saw its eyes and said they were huge. It ran very fast  we stopped and rolled down window  there was a smell and then we turned around and looked more for it. Off to the right on the road is a wild life preserve. With a lot of power lines and a river called the Econlochahatche River. ,Off Fort Christmas Road in East Orlando  FL.

940,My bigfoot sighting accurred on Saturday  October 27th  2012 about 6 00pm. We were on Highway 50 heading towards Christmas  Florida when we crossed over the St. John  s river. I was sitting in the back of the car  we were talking and I just happened to glance over to the right to look at the river when I saw a brown upright figure just walking away from the water  s edge. Even though it was a distance away  I could see that it was one color from head to toe and the whole body was evenly shapped like an animal in the distance rather than a person wearing clothing. As I saw it take those couple of steps I could see the arms swing with the motion of the legs. When we arrive at the restaurant I said to my boyfriend that I think I just saw a sasquatch  that it just didn  t look like a person. I  ve been thinking about it ever since. ,Christmas is between Titusville and Orlando  Florida.

941,Hey guys and Lady  My name is xxx and I have never seen a Bigfoot or Sasquatch. I do however believe that something could be out there. May 23rd (2013) at around 11 30 pm I was on my way to the Orlando Airport to pick up my son-in-law. I was on the Beach Line or 528 toll road. I had slowed down due to his flight being delayed and it had been raining when I saw something moving from the side of the road toward the fence and pasture land.  It is not unusual to see deer  wild turkeys and from time to time hogs even on this busy road  however this was none of the above. What I saw was very large  hunched over  and moving quickly toward  the wire fence and was a greyish color and the hair was longer  so it was not a loose cow or large hog. I was close enough to see the size and it was big  I cannot tell you how tall it was only a guess. I have heard about The Skunk Ape but again never seen anything and I don  t go out looking for one  I just know what I saw.  There is a lot of wet land and swamp land close to the Orlando International Airport and The Beach Line is a major toll road that connects the east cost of our area to I-4 in Orlando. Thank you  XXX ,I saw it on the side of the road just before you enter the first toll plaza. ,Orange,14,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12095,yes
942,My husband and I are from California and new to Florida. We wanted to explore some Florida forest land. We happened upon the â€œRock Springs Run State Reserveâ€. We drove onto a dirt road  and parked off to the side. We got out and just started walking around. Right away  we saw a lot of vultures and groups of white tail deer. The area was buzzing with wildlife and sounds we didnâ€™t recognize. We wanted to walk deeper into the trees  which would take us down to a lower terrain  but even with our hiking clothes and shoes  it turned out to be too much for us. Weâ€™re very healthy and active  but it didnâ€™t seem like a fun idea. There were just too many wet  swampy areas of ground  and it turned out to be almost impossible  and we werenâ€™t sure if we wanted to be struggling through alligator territory. We made our way back up to a dirt path  and thatâ€™s when we started hearing the banging sound. At first we thought it was a person out there doing something. But then the same sound started coming from another direction  maybe a quarter mile from the first one. It sounded like a they were hitting trees with a baseball bat  or a big piece of wood. It continued to go back and forth from one spot to another. It was one of those things that didnâ€™t seem weird at first  until you stop to think about it. No animals do that  and why would people go way out there and begin hitting trees in the swamp  and then take turns doing it? We just couldnâ€™t fathom what the purpose would be. We listened then walked back to the car and left. ,[Investigator (MM) Notes  Location  Rock Springs Run State Reserve  30601 County Rd 433  Mount Plymouth FL 32776 GPS coordinates for where witnesses were standing when they heard knocks not far to the east of their position  28.793132  -81.450283 ,Orange,14,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12095,no

944,I am 51 years old  and have trapped  hunted  fished  and camped all my life. I was scouting for deer sign in the fall on a swampy island that I can only reach by using chest waders.  It was cold  clear early afternoon  and as I walked along near the edge of the island  things got very quiet and I stopped all of a sudden--why I don  t know--and I heard what started out as an owl hooting but ended with a monkey type sound. Sort of   whooo-whooo-whooo-oo-oo-ahh-ahh . I only heard it once--and got the distinct feeling that another presence was in the woods beside myself. Owl  s have many calls I know  but I thought this was unusual given the time of day and weather being clear. ,State managed lands  surrounded by hunting club.

945,Me and my brother and our cousin (11  10 & 12 years old at the time) used to frequent a neighborhood across from ours called Acorn Circle. It was a heavily wooded area that only had about three homes at the time. On the Southeast side of this neighborhood there were no homes at all and was especially a favorite spot of ours to play since it had a few curiosities about the area. Just to describe the location a bit; this wooded area had a nice canopy of trees and was somewhat darkened even in the bright daylight. There was this large mound of eroded dirt that had a patch of sunlight directly coming through the tree canopy. About 15 feet away there was a large drainage ditch that was about five foot across and four foot deep  someone at one time had placed a log across this ditch in order to cross it. On the other side there was an old VW bug and van that had been there so long that small trees were actually growing up and through them. Further back from this was the scarce remnants of a burned down house  we rarely explored back further than this due to the increasing darkness  heavy foliage and swampy ness. On the day this sighting occurred my cousin and myself were playing on the dirt mound with our matchbox cars while my brother explored just a short distance away to the left of us and the VWs. Suddenly we were jolted to the sound of a loud crack as if someone had stepped on a stick; we immediately looked to the direction of the VWs where the sound came from. There approximately 10 feet to the right of them was a large human like figure. I roughly estimate that it was around seven feet tall; its color was not really distinguishable due to the poor lighting. Its right side was slightly obscured by some small trees on the bank of the ditch. We stared at it for about a minute or so and then started conversing with each other wondering who or what this thing was that was just standing there watching us. I remember one of us supposing it was a bear standing up but that was quickly batted down since shoulders were clearly visible  it simply looked like large hairy man. None of us recall seeing a face or any other clear details considering that all that was really visible was a jagged hairy silhouette against the dimly lit woods. At one point I remember saying â€œI bet itâ€™s Bobby (an older teenager that lived in that neighborhood) trying to scare usâ€ I shouted  â€œHey Bobby stop playing around  we know itâ€™s you!â€â€¦ but no response. Then one of us yelled out; â€œok ok you can come out now  stop trying to scare us whoever you areâ€â€¦ again no response. As we continued to stare it slowly moved slightly to its left fully exposing itself from behind that small clump of trees  as it moved it raised its left hand up and outwards in order to grab a tree branch while at the same time leaning forward as if to get a better look at us  my brother said that when it did this that from his particular angle he could see long hair dangling from its arm. At this point we all ran as fast as we could and have never returned. ,Southeast corner of Acorn circle; Just below and to the right of the star on this mapquest URL (*Note - Honore Ave went through years after this incident) ,Sarasota,6,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12115,yes
946,Me and my brother was fishing in a local pond for bass on a john boat in the evening and we were just talking back and forth when this thing non human or not a bear bent over from the edge of the palmettos and stuck both hands in water and was drinking from its hands . It stared at us like it hadn  t a care in the world . Eyes were dark looking had reddish brown hair that had a shine to it in the sun .Looked to be about 7   or taller . Had us pretty scared as my car was parked just 100 feet we had seen it . It never made a sound when it came in to drink and no sounds when it left . We hurried up and left there never to go back and didn  t tell but a couple people in the past years. It is something that has no explaination so we just try to forget it . Never tried to harm us or make any contact but the thought of it still raises the hair on my neck. It had really large hands and it kinda sit on its legs when crouched down there was a musky odor like a deer in rut smell. Just happened so fast been hard to remember it only was there for a couple minutes after seeing us.

947,Hello  I just found ur web site  have 2 reports. NO B.S.                   This occured in North Port  Florida in 1999  in the summer. My wife & i were sleeping & about 2am we both woke up and heard something outside are window. We were living at the time on the backside of Myakka State Park. This area of Myakka State Park is very desolate  very isolated. Besides ur regular wild animals only other thing that would be walking around would be ur Florida marijuana growers in the swamps out here. My wife & i have lived in Florida 30yrs and both are avid outdoors types.  I hung out in these woods in this area for over 20yrs and thought I had heard everything  my wife also. Well anyway when we woke up and heard something out are widow  we had a very strong odor of something coming thru are window. My wife & i looked at each other with looks on are face  with wonder  we both said at the same time  what the hell is out there  right as we said that this thing shreeked almost human sounding  but a real wild shreking...I was going to send our lab & pit bull after it but we couldn  t get them out of our room & they had never been scared of anything.Then I went to check on are little girl she slept thru this. When this thing screemed in our window  to reach the window from outside it would have to be at least 7ft tall. We did not dare go outside  espically since our dogs wanted no part of what ever it was... ,As I said  this area is swamp area of the park are street Ruff st. is right next to the large cannal that borders myakka park no one goes out on this end of the park except ur local pot growers becase it is very isolated still is today. ,Sarasota,6,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12115,no
948,My husband and I were driving home on I-75  the day after Christmas. Our car just started to accelerate after being in traffic for over an hour due to an accident. My husband was watching the cars closely and I was observing the environment on my left side  as I normally do on a road trip. I looked over to my right and saw something large and black about a football field distance away. At first it looked like it wasn  t moving  but I kept watching and after a few seconds I saw an arm extend and it move forward towards the woods. My first instinct was to think it was a bear  but then as I continued to fixate on the animal  I realized it had very long black hair and was extremely broad in the shoulder/lat area. I continued to watch it move forward  very slowly and realized it was in a crouched position but looked as flat and large as the top of a car  from my view. The whole experience was very surreal to me and I think I  m still in shock. The whole length of my viewing time was approximately 5-7 seconds. ,Headed N on I-75  right side  between exit #179 and #191. ,Sarasota,6,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12115,yes
949,The witness does not have a computer  so I asked the witness to fill out our report form by hand. This following is what she wrote  I was driving home toward Arcadia on HWY 72 around 8 30 pm. I thought I first saw a deer to my right  but then I realized it wasn  t a deer. It was a bigfoot and it was huge! I had to hit the brakes  it was so close to the car. It ran across the street and looked at me! It crossed in two steps. It had long dark brown hair. The hair was not shaggy  but smooth like a dog. It ran so close to my car  at my car  it seemed as if it was trying to purposely cross before me. Once I passed by it  I stopped the car and got out. I didn  t see anything  but smelled a musky smell. I called my kids while I stood there on the road. ,Just over the bridge ,Sarasota,6,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12115,yes

951,In the fall of 1981. My next door neighbor and myself  were walking down a dirt road in Casselberry. The road runs along side of a wooded tract of land. The land has been reserved for a bird sancturary. Anyway  this road runs behind some homes all the way down to South Seminole middle school. On this evening we were walking to the school for a dance in the gym. It was about 9 p.m.. We were about 50 or 60 yards from the end of the road  where a large opening sits. I had briefly stopped to tie my shoe. Suddenly  we heard crashing sounds  like footsteps only louder. There were 5 or 6 steps  and as we turned to look at what was making the noise  two trees parted as if giant hands were just brushing them aside. Sadly  we were both too scared to stay around any longer. We ran all the way around S.S.M.S. and around the Elementary school. Cut through the catwalk. And  ran the rest of the way home. Several weeks later my mother reported hearing loud noises outside of our house. We owned one of the homes that sat next to this woods. She had said she had been awoken by our pitbull  staring into the woods  barking. She said she had heard these large sounds  almost like foot steps  except she said that they covered far too much ground. She said she had heard four or five steps then the sound of wood breaking. And then a large thrashing sound as though it were shaking large bushes together. The next day my mother  myself and our neighbors went out into the woods to investigate. We found a large branch approximately 10 inches around. Had been torn from a tree. And I do mean torn  this wasn  t a cut or a branch that had been struck by lightning. This had been ripped from the tree. Anyway  we lived there for several more years  and although my friends and I spent a whole lot of our summer days and nights searching those woods for some kind of proof. None was ever found by us. I have been wondering for a long time if anyone in that area has exp. the same thing. ,take Winter Park dr. to the entrance of South Seminole middle school. Once enering stay to the right of the school. Pull into the sand parking lot and head down the dirt road that runs away from the school.

952,Camping by a lake with family. Step brother took me to go get firewood from a clearing. The clearing was about 50 feet in diameter. Firewood was stacked outside the perimeter. I was about 14 years old at the time. My step brother was telling me how he would protect me if we came in contact with a bear. I was kinda frightened camping and being alone in the dark so he told me that to comfort me. Well when we arrived to the clearing we split up to get firewood. So I walked to the very outer rim and bent down to pick up a piece of wood. At first I heard a growl like a bear... I was stunned. I immediately looked for my step brother to tell him to knock it off. He looked at me and said I didn  t do anything what are you talking about. As soon as he said that to my left in the dense tree brush I saw out of the corner of my eye a tall dark figure stand up about 8-9 feet tall (approximation but it was huge). It then grabbed two nearby small trees and began to shake them and my eyes lit up. My brother ran over to see what was happening and then took one look and bolted off to the other side back to camp leaving me. I ran to him screaming and I guess he felt bad doubled back to pick me up and then ran back to the campsite. This is important to note that it was not an alligator or a bear or anything I can identify that can reach that height standing like a person. I am a non-denominational christian and I don  t necessarily believe in  bigfoot . But what I saw really does put me off and fits the description to the T. Im now stationed in Colorado in the United States Army and cant wait to go back to Florida. ,Dark secluded woodsy area bordering a lake. ,Seminole,5,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12117,yes
953,On Monday  June 30  2008  between 5 00 a.m. and 5 15 a.m.  I had the experience of hearing a chilling and unexplained sound.  I was taking numerous boxes and garbage bags from the garage to the end of my driveway at the street for trash pickup.  I had made approximately 6 trips back and forth when  after laying a box down at the curb  I heard something that made me stop in my tracks.  I experienced what I first thought was the start of a loud siren  a loud and ascending WHOOOOOâ€¦  coming from across the street.  The sound came from a tree line about 200 feet away at the edge of Horseshoe Lake.  There are empty grated lots directly across the street from my house (about 125 feet deep) and then approximately another 25 feet or more of dense palmetto scrub and primarily pines and loblolly bay trees down to the lake shore.  The sound continued to ascend in pitch and when the pitch didnâ€™t change like that of a siren and I realized that a siren would not be coming from that direction  but rather from the highway behind our house  I felt somewhat panicked.  The sound ended in a booming â€“OOP.  The entire whoop was long in duration and went from a low to high pitch.  It seemed to be aimed directly towards me and was extremely far carrying in tone.  I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  When my brain could not place the sound with any animal or bird that I am familiar with  I became very frightened at thinking that a man was watching me and calling out.  I started to take some steps backward towards the garage in anticipation that I would see something moving towards me across the empty lot.  Within seconds of the WHOOP  an owl called out with a common hooting from the top of a tree in that same area  as if it had been startled.  The owlâ€™s voice was very distinct from the other sound in the loudness and the way it carried  as well as the elevation of the source of the sound.  I went back into the garage and waited for about 5 minutes there to listen for any other sounds  but only heard the frogs that are common at that time.  Although still dark  there were clear skies at the time  and I could see the silhouette of the tree line.  My side of the street was dimly lit by the lights in the garage and street lights a short distance away.  I go out at this time every morning to haul trash and to take my dog for a quick walk out to the mailbox  and I am used to hearing numerous types of frogs  owls  and whippoorwills. As I stood there  logic told me that even a large man could not have made the resonating sound that I heard from that distance away. Over the next few days  I told my family members what I had heard and asked if they knew of an animal or bird that made such a sound  but they didnâ€™t.  The sound I heard was so unusual  that I couldnâ€™t dismiss it.  I felt the need to keep trying to satisfy the mystery of the sound by placing a native bird or animal to it.  I read every voice description of Florida bird species entries in my North American bird book  paying closed attention to all owls  loons  cranes  egrets  herons and hawks  that I thought may be large enough to have such a bellowing voice.  None of the voices were described as â€œwhoops.â€  I then went online and searched for â€œbird sound whoopâ€ and â€œanimal sound whoop.â€  I spent quite a bit of time on National Geographicâ€™s website listening to voice recordings of numerous birds from this area as well as bobcats  coyotes  foxes  etc.  Nothing seemed to match.  I then started to notice the many links to the BFRO website as well as a link to a video of our local Channel 13 newscast of an expedition that BFRO had in the Tampa area about a year ago.  When I played the news clip  and heard one of the female researchers make a call out like a whoop  I almost felt relieved  like I knew in my heart that I was on the right track.  The sound I heard was very similar to the call she made  although the whoop I heard was of a longer duration.  After seeing the news clip  I felt more comfortable about researching the information on the BRFO website.  I came across the sound recordings  and after listening to several  I became convinced that what I heard matched more closely to some of the Skunk Ape recordings than to any other animal or bird known in this area.  I decided to call your organization to discuss what I had experienced. Below are the most similar recordings I found on the website as compared to the sound that I heard  1974 Whoops and Knocks from California (although I heard only one â€œwhoopâ€ and it was of longer duration) The â€œFlorida Howlâ€ and the 1994 Moaning Howl from Columbiana County  Ohio (the howls in this clip start off like the siren-like beginning of the whoop I heard  but these then descend in pitch as opposed to the one I heard which continued to ascend until ending in a â€“OOP) ,Exact location omitted ,Seminole,5,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12117,no

955,This happened tonight. I had gone outside on the porch to have a cigarette about 9 00 pm and my two German Sherpards went out with me. I was outside about 2 -3 mins. when less then 100 feet from me just at the woods edge I heard a very loud yell/scream. My two dogs immediately jumped off the porch and took off towards the sound and I ran inside to get a shotgun and light. The dogs where running around sniffing the ground frantically but staying in the yard and not going into the wood. With my flashlight in one hand and gun in the other I went out into the yard and was looking around for a clue as to what could have made such a weird loud noise. Even though we live in the country we do have a few houses around us and the only thing that I could come up with is that it had to be some kid messing around and at that time I became mad and yelled   you might think messing around here playing games is fun but I  ll tell you I have a gun and someone could very well get hurt messing around like this in the dark . I had barely gotten the words out of my mouth when I would say about 25 yards into the woods came the scream again. The dogs dashed into the woods and even though they normally obey me very well  all of the yelling would not get them to return to the yard for about 5 mins. Two things stand out as very odd about what happened tonight. One is that it was right in my yard  granted it was at the edge but it was in the yard none the less. It made such a loud yell as though it wanted me to know that it was there! The other thing I find strange is that the dogs never once barked or growled. You would have to know my dogs to understand how strange that is. They are very protective of the yard. They will bark at a leaf blowing though  and if anyone comes up the drive  watch out! They love to hear themselves bark. They did not bark once  they just kept running around as though they had gone nuts. My wife was in the living room and heard it.  It was loud enough to hear it with the windows closed and the TV on. I am 45 years old  have hunted and camped a good part of my life  spending a lot of hours outdoors and I have never heard anything even close to what I heard tonight.  ,It happend on St. Ambrose Church Rd.

956,Last year my brother and I were hog hunting in the Guana River WMA in St Johns County  FL.  There was a lot of activity in the woods that day as this place gets crowded during hog hunts.  We were the last hunters to leave and we were talking to the check station attendant (biologist).  It was about an hour after dark and it was starting to get cold.  There was only a propane heater and latern running at the check station.  The Game Wardens had cleared the WMA of all vehicles  so we know that we were the only ones left in the area. To get into the WMA  you must drive through a wooded portion of a state park (no hunting allowed).  The check station is about 300 yards past the entrance gate. As we were getting ready to leave  we heard a very loud screaming (several screams over a 6-7 second period) about 75 to 100 yards behind the check station back towards a marshy area that borders the state park and WMA.  These screams were high pitched and very powerful  and they seemed to go right through you.  It sounded as though there was someone getting attacked by something.  It made the hair on the back of our necks stand up.  The air was very calm and cool.  We could also hear the faint sound of something in the woods moving palmettos and bushes (lasted about 3 or 4 seconds). At first we thought it might have been a bird in the marsh  but this sound was way too loud and the even though it was high pitched  it was very dynamic as though a very large animal had made it.  The sound was closer than the marsh  and we heard the noises of something moving in the woods.  It sounded very similar to some the recorded sounds I have heard on this site.  We asked the biologist what he thought it was and he did not know.  For several minutes we pondered the idea that it was a bobcat/panther  hog  bird  of some sort of small game getting attacked such as a rabbit squeel  but we all concurred that it was none of those.  My brother and I have been hunting/camping all of our lives and know different animal sounds.  It freaked us out pretty bad and we left after hearing this.  I was especially freaked out by the response of the biologist who did not stick around. Normally I would have just ignored this incident and passed it off as some animal as mentioned before  but I know that it was not.  It also brought back the memory of a very similar sound we heard years ago (84-86?) in Pennsylvania while camping on a vaction trip (rural area of Lancaster County).  It was just after dark as we returned back to our camper (grandparents motorhome) from the camp ground fishing pond.  As we arrived  we heard the same type of sound off in the distance.  It scared us to death and we did not leave the camper all night. We urged our grandparents to travel to our next camp ground the next day. I have heard other stories of sightings and sounds from very credible witnesses.  This incident makes me a believer  and I will never walk in the woods feeling the same again. ,Guana River WMA which is several miles North of St. Augustine off A1A (Guana River Dam State Park).

The sounds were about 75 to 100 yards behind the check station towards a marshy area that borders the WMA and State Park (Southwest direction). ,St. Johns,4,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12109,no
957,My son and I were out fishing one night in July of 2011 at about 1am on friday night at the Matanza bridge back waters  this is on A1A in Florida. at about 2 00 am  we heard this really weird sound of howling and grunts so we sat there for about 25 minutes or so and the sound kept getting louder and closer to where we were parked. My son said to me dad did you see that  I said what and he said something really big was approaching where we were parked sitting in the car. So he winded up the window and said we better leave  so i said no just wait a little bit longer and lets see if it will come back. after about another 10 minutes or so the howling began again but this time it seemed to be more than one howl  as if there was a reply to the deeper howl. So I told him to start the car and lets get out of the area. Well he did so and we were leaving the area and after we traveled about 100 yards or so there it was one of the biggest Bigfoots right in front of us. It was about 9 feet tall really hairy and walking with a slight crouched posture  It was headed East to the ocean. I saw it briefly as we passed to where it crossed the road but it was moving really fast  not running just really long strides. It looked back briefly and went under the bridge and out to the ocean. ,It was between two canals that lead to the ocean ,St. Johns,4,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12109,yes
958,Just last Saturday  February  23rd  I was in Twelve Mile Swamp Conservation Area which is just north of the St. Augustine  FL Airport  bordered on the north by International Golf Parkway and running from Rte 1 on the east border to Rte 95 on the west. I had driven about 3 miles from Rte 1 west bound on International Golf Parkway to a trail entrance. I drove southward about 1.5 miles into the area then east about 1 mile when the road I was on ended at a cross road where several large pieces of logging machinery were parked. I had been knocking  hooting  whistling  talking for about 45 minutes out in the open  right in this intersection when I heard sticks breaking from something walking towards me in the woods. As it got nearer I heard several heavy  bipedal footsteps  almost stomping  coming very close to the wood line bordering the road. Then loud thrashing and intentionally loud moving about from just within the treeline  in the trees and behind 6 foot reeds/brush just on the other side of the drainage ditch between the road and woods. The noise was only 20 yards from me but I couldn  t see anything as I stood on the edge of the road and peered in. Whatever it was  was very big and it sounded as if it was about to break into the open. I could not smell anything  nor had I felt I had been being watched. It approached quickly and with determination. I became nervous and walked back to my car about 50 ft. behind me. I was so sure something would break through the brush that I got in my car and turned it around for a possible quick getaway  back the way I had come. When I got out quickly and walked back to near the noise it was gone. I remained probably an hour trying to draw whatever it was back  but nothing. The reeds/brush were fairly thick but not super thick like a line of Palmetto. I was confused as to why I couldn  t see anything or even brush moving. But the noise was loud and obvious and very close. Something was upset about my presence. , ,St. Johns,4,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12109,yes
959,Me and my father were hunting at richloam wildlife management area. we had been walking through the swamps all morning and on various occasions there was a really fowl smell that would come and go. At that time I just figured it was the swamp. When we got out of the swamp we were thirsty so we decided to run to the store since we had some time before we went to where we were going to hunt the afternoon. While driving out to the store we came around a curve in the road there was something really big that stepped half way behind a scrub oak alongside the road. My dad was only going about 10 to 15 MPH and as we went by we got a good view of what it was or at least what it looked like  as he hit the brakes I could not belive what I saw. I asked my dad what that was after we went by it. And he asked me what I saw and i told him and he said the same thing and we turned around to take a look at where it was but it was gone. It left a nice size trail the way it ran. It was about 7 1/2 ft. to 8 ft.tall  about 4 ft. to 4 1/2 ft. across the shoulders  covered with dark brown hair with a Reddish tint standing on two legs. it looked to be really muscular.

963,Shaking of trees immediately upon getting out of truck. We were going hunting. Heard some knockings off in the distance. Walking down the trail  we could smell a foul smell (later we found the source which was a dead hog  couldn  t tell if something had killed it and ate it or if it was shot and scavenged upon). Later while hunting we climbed up a small hill and I spotted something behind a large tree stump. I didn  t say anything and the other witness pointed it out immediately too.

964,I live in The Villages  Florida which is a community encompassing three counties (Sumter  Lake  and Marion).  Behind my house there is one of those high tower power line paths.  On the other side  there are more homes.  The area is urban  but close to wooded areas.  One night in early to mid-December my partner and I were sitting on our lanai (as we do nightly).  It was about 10 00 p.m. or so.  Suddenly the quiet was broken by a loud cry which sounded like it was coming from close to the street.  We looked at each other and asked each other jokingly  â€œIs that Bigfoot?â€  It did not sound like any human we had ever heard. We listened and no more sounds.  The next night  I was sitting on the lanai  my partner had not yet come out  about 9 00 p.m.  I stopped the sound on my computer and just then I heard  distinctly  two rocks clack together at the end of my short backyard  close to where my neighbor to the left and I share a property line close.  There are tall  6-7 foot  plants at the end of my property. I sat there for maybe 15 minutes listening and heard nothing more.  A few days later  for two days  my partner and I came out and smelled a strange  unknown  odor.  My dog didnâ€™t make any noise but sniffed the air.   It wasnâ€™t a bad odor  just unusual.  A few days later  I was again sitting on the lanai  about 11 00 p.m. and to my left I heard a stone hit the side of my home which made it vibrate.  I sat quietly for a few minutes and went back to my business.  An hour later  when I got ready to go inside  I heard what sounded like 4-5 pebbles hitting the side of the lanai where I was standing.  About 3 nights ago  my partner and I were sitting on the lanai again  this time it was lightly raining.  It was about 11 30 p.m.  Suddenly we heard a barrage of pebbles hit the side of the lanai.   My partner said  those were stones.  I was unsure if it could have been the rain.  A few moments later  another barrage of pebbles hit our lanai.  My dog got up and looked.  It was not the gentle rain we were hearing.  After the second time  we didnâ€™t hear anything else.  I donâ€™t know if this is even possible to be bothered by a Bigfoot in The Villages.  We are the only ones who sit on our lanai after dark in this area.  What do you think?  I do not want this information posted to your website until I hear from the BFRO to see if there is a possibility that our suspicions can possibly be true.  Believe me  this is truly bewildering. , ,Sumter,9,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12119,no
965,I had two different encounters with in a week apart  within a mile of each other. I used to take walks in the afternoons when I would get off of work. There was an old logging road that made a loop about 3 miles around in the woods across from my house. It was about 3 thirty or so when I set off this day. I always carried a little 22 pistol with me in case I came across any snakes. My grandmothers two dogs also always went with me on these walks. We had turned off the main grade and gone maybe a quarter of a mile into the woods when we started down through the slough. The logging road cut between to little swamps. There was alot of scrub oaks and low growing trees just before it opened up into the swamps. I had just cleared the scrub oaks and came into the clearing when I noticed the change. It was like everything in the woods had vanished. The birds stopped singing  I mean it was quiet. I broke out in a cold sweet and the hair on the back of my neck stood up like I had just been shot. Like when you know you are being watched. I glanced down at the dogs and both of them had come to a stop like they were frozen in place. The hair on both of them was standing straight up. They were looking off to the right of me but neither one of them so much as growled. It may sound funny but it seemed like on cue the wind picked up and I caught a smell that I really cant describe. I looked to my right  and about fifty or sixty yards up the hill I could make out the shape of something very big   standing between a couple of oak trees  and some other brush. I stood there for about thirty seconds or so trying to figure out what it was before it moved. It reached out and grabbed two of the oak trees and started shaking them back and forth. Then I heard something like I have never heard before in my life. It didnt sound like an animal growling or a person screaming  but kind of a mix of both. The next thing I knew I had reached for my pistol  looked down and both dogs were gone. I decide that it was time for me to leave at that point and made my way very quickly back to the house. The next encounter happened about 5 days later on the other side of the main grade. I had just left the house from having lunch and going back to work. I was riding a four wheeler at the time and we had a lot of trails cut out through the woods that we rode on. I had just come out of the woods and onto a pig trail just up from what we called bathtub springs. The pig trail turns into a main grade about a quarter of a mile from where I came out on it. I started towards the main grade when I noticed something very large and brown running through the woods about 20 to 25 yards to my left. It kept up with me as I rode about 15 mph  for at least 20 seconds. I saw it sling something in a side ways motion  like throwing a frisbee. I was just about to the main grade when I realized something had hit me in the chest. I didn  t stop until I got out to the main paved road. When I did stop to see what had hit me  I saw that it was a rabbit that had been turned inside out. It was several years before I worked up the courage to go back into those woods. A lot of people may not believe me  but those that know me  know that I grew up in those woods hunting  trapping  fishing  and camping out. I have walked up on and been stalked by Florida panthers and wild hogs  but I have never had that feeling of truly being scared until these to encounters. ,(Exact location omitted per witness   request.) ,Suwannee,6,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12121,yes
966,About twelve years ago we were on a very remote and desolate stretch of highway  southeast of Live Oak  Florida  headed south. It was about 1 15 AM. There were four of us in an older model Monte Carlo pulling a Coleman travel trailer loaded with cave diving gear  (probably weighing in around eight-hundred pounds gross). A Tennessee State Trooper was driving and I was shotgun. The two men in the back were asleep. Suddenly  right out of nowhere  (with only our headlights for illumination)  a tall  huge â€œblack formâ€ rushed from the right edge of the roadway and came toward us  (in a perpendicular path as if to cross the highway). It was so quick that the driver had no reaction time whatsoever! While the car missed this erect  but stooped  huge black form the trailer obviously got it. The trailer sounded as if it had exploded and I saw  in the glow of our brake lights  that the entire trailer became airborne and went about as high as the roof of the car! â€œWhat did we hit?â€ was the question yelled by the sleepy owner. The other sleepy passenger yelled  â€œWhat the hell?â€ The trooper calmly looked over at me and in an astounded voice asked  â€œWhat the hell was that? Did you see that?â€ I replied quietly  â€œI saw that and I have no idea what that was!â€ The owner asked from the back seat  â€œWas it a bear? Iâ€™ll bet it was a bear!â€ The trooper  in total agreement with me replied  â€œI donâ€™t think so. It was too big!â€ Well  all the while we had been braking to a stop. We all got out  checked out the trailer  checked the passenger side of the car  looked for a corpse  looked for blood  looked for hair  but found nothing at all! The best I remember we even turned around and drove back past the point of impact but saw nothing! It will be passed off as a bear  (I am certain)  but I do not believe a bear could possibly be that big  move that fast  or suffer that kind of impact without being injured. (Just my opinion) I have never thought about this being a bigfoot until a year or so ago and then it all sort of began coming together for me. (Whatever it was  it was huge  black  fast and one tough son-of-a-gun!) ,A major two-lane heading south probably southwest of Live Oak  FL. ,Suwannee,6,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12121,yes
967,I was driving on I-10 in the early morning hours.  There weren  t any other cars for miles. My friend who was riding with me was unfortunately asleep so she didn  t see it. I looked over into the other lane and saw this dark man-like figure crossing the road.  It was really tall  I  d say about 6ft or so.  I walked rather wierd like an ape. I couldn  t see any specific colors because of the light but I  d say it was dark brown. That  s all I can remember. ,I had been on I-10 for about 10 minutes after switching from I-75 ,Suwannee,6,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12121,yes
968,I live in Suwannee County 3mi from the intersection of I75 and I10. If you drew a line through the 2 Suwannee Co. sightings you show on this site  the line would go thru my house. A creek that feeds Rocky Creek  which is the creek featured in the Wellborn sighting runs 250 yards from my front door. Beavers have dammed it up and now there is a huge swamp as a result. I was walking near the swamp 3 days ago and found a footprint that measured 16in long. Conveniently the only camera i have is broken. Last night I heard a vocalization that would make your blood run cold. It was very similar to vacalizations on your site  though much loger in duration and higher pitched. It was followed by three thumps that sounded like wood being knocked together. I had a broken shovel handle in my flowerbed  and i responded by knoking the same pattern. It respoded with three more knocks. 30 seconds later i heard a similar vocalization much further away and lower pitched. im still freaking out. ,get off I-75 @ 136 Live Oak/ White Springs  that general vacinity... ,Suwannee,6,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12121,no
969,I was out behind my house smoking  walking my dogs around 6 30 pm  just before dark. My back yard is grass for about 100 yards then it is medium to heavy woods (about 4 acres total). My dogs just froze in place looking towards the woods. I was asking them whats wrong  what do you see? They stayed still  gazing into the woods for about a minute. I also looked towards the woods but saw nothing but trees and I could make out a large tree stump  then they both ran from me back into the house through a the doggy door on the North side of my house. When looking towards the woods they are to the East of me. I kept staring at the woods looking side to side while still seeing nothing. My cigarette was done  I tossed it onto the ground and went to step on it when I noticed some movement about 20 yards in the woods. It was towards the tree stump...I watched as this stump  which was about 3 to 4 foot tall stand up and double its size... I was in shock  it seemed like it was not real. I stayed motionless while watching this thing  which clearly was NO tree stump start to walk deeper into the woods  heavy steps each time it walked  it was between 7   or 8 feet tall  had hair/fur covering it. The way I could tell this is because it was walking in a zig zag motion  purposely I guess to try and hide from me behind trees. The sun would only shine in spots through the top of the trees and I could see the hair/fur shine maybe every 5 seconds or so/ This thing made noise/sound only twice from itself  once when it first rose up  I interpreted it as a  Damn now I have to move  moan/grunt... second when he/she looked at me right before it got to the gas line road (which is a dirt  right of way road for the gas company) almost to tell me  you stay where you are  don  t follow me and I had no plans on that.... I went back out the next day  dogs refused to go with me  to see if there was something it was doing in the woods and found nothing. Also went to the dirt road looking for prints but found only a part of one because of deer and other animals walking over them. I believe this thing  and others follow the deer here for food  the [Suwannee River] State Park has a no Hunting buffer I think that is 5 or 10 miles out from the park. The deer know this and I am sure if these things have been here for a while also know that people don  t hunt around here.. I have been away from this house do to selling it but recently purchased it back. Only one of my dogs is still with me and will still not walk in the woods like we used to... This thing had medium to dark reddish/brown hair/fur  when it snarled/growled at me. I saw fingers  no hair on the palms because I could see skin  no facial hair. It did not stink as bad as I read about. It smelled more like wet dog and pine sap..I have been back here about 3 weeks but see no signs of this thing but did hear its growl two nights ago  I was on my front porch that faces west  smoking before going to bed. My dog was laying by my side. What ever it was scared my dog and me also. It sounded like an owl at first but turned into a growl at the end.  Weird...

970,The incident happened in my yard last night and my husband and I went outside and smelled a skunk smell and we walked outside and we seen red demon eyes  then we did not think nothing of it and tonight we went for a walk down the road 1 mile and we came upon it and it hollered at us and growled and it was brown and gray furry and 8ft tall. It was tall and it walked away from us and it hollered again. ,Omitted to protect the witness   privacy. ,Suwannee,6,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12121,yes
971,In May of 1985 on a sunny afternoon  a realtor in Ormond Beach took me north on Beach Street.  We turned left and entered The Village of Pine Run.  Before reaching the area of houses  I spotted what looked like a young pre-teen holding a tall stick vertically.  Suddenly  the other than human walked on hands and feet to the middle of the road and then stood erect.  My realtor slammed on the breaks and cried   What is that?   I suggested a bear but the shape of the head was not that of a bear.  We agreed it was not a monkey due to no long tail and.  It appeared to be 4.5 to 5ft. tall.  It disappeared into the woods. , ,Volusia,12,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12127,yes
972,A large  hairy  ape-like humanoid standing in the middle of a dirt road at approximately 3 30am. A creature was sighted in the headlights of the witness   pickup truck. As the witnesses stopped their truck the creature began to approach them. The middle part of the creature was closely observed in the headlights and confirmed not to be a bear or any other known animal. Both witnesses reported a sickening odor that smelled like cabbage. The smell was so overwelming that one of the witnesses began to gag. This report was never reported to the authorities or the media. This information was first made available to the researcher in 1995 by witness  P.S. ,Oak Hill  Florida in Volusia County ,Volusia,12,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12127,yes
973,The first incident happened in the Fall of 1998. The witnesses were sleeping  around 10 PM  when they were awakened by 2 loud vocalizations. The first was more of a loud growl  the second started low and progressed to higher pitches and sounded like a scream. The witnesses related that it sounded as if what ever made the sounds was standing in the room with them  it was so loud. They said you could feel it. The husband got up to investigate but found nothing. He said that his 2 dogs were very scared  they would not move from where they were laying in the house. The husband stated that   I couldn  t have pryed them off the floor with a spatula.  The second incident occured in October of 1999. The wife let their dogs out that morning. The dog involved did not return as she usually does  so the wife went out to look for her. At the bottom of the front steps she found the dog bleeding from the stomach area. The wife took the mixed breed dog to the vet. The vet stated that the dog had been hit by something big  such as a car or something. The witnesses said that this dog never went to the street  which was approx. 200 yards from the house. The dog weighed approx. 25 pounds. The injuries included massive internal injuries and a 1 1/2 inch cut on her stomach.The vet said it was a puncture wound of some sort and also the dog  s rib was broken. Unfortunetly  the dog died. The witness believes that the dog walked up on a Bigfoot and was kicked by the creature. The cut on her stomach could have been where it  s toenail had cut her. , ,Volusia,12,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12127,no
974,First of all  I am a 57 year old H.S. & College Psychology and Humanities teacher with a background in phenomenon reasearch. I have two Masters degrees and  I have often been nicknamed the  resident sceptic  because I demand scientific principles in real time for all observable data. I despise hoaxes. My wife and I were standing on a boardwalk on a bright  moonlit night around 11 30 p.m.  I was looking north when I first saw it at about 100 yards.  At first  I thought it was just a late night jogger.  After it got about 50 yards closer I alerted my wife to  turn around  because I realized that this was not your  average jogger.  It walked with a smooth  long stride with arms swinging about two feet in front and back.  It was a uniform  solid black or brown ( shadowy ) in color; no light face  hands or shoes. We watched it walk south right at the edge of the surf  southward until it disappeared down the beach.  And I am quite sure that it saw us. I thought about yelling or  encountering  it but that thought lasted just for two seconds.  This thing was walking fast  with a deliberate stride and a slight forward stance.  It was  on a mission  as it were. There were no footprints because it was walking slightly into the water. I KNOW what I saw; my wife and I were in complete agreement on all of the details. I guess this is another incidence where I can only REPORT the data.  There seems to no way to research it; unless someone else happened to see or confront it. ,It was walking down the driving area of the beach southward toward the wildlife preserve... ,Volusia,12,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12127,yes
975,BFRO  My friend and I  were   spotting   gators one night in Ormond Beach  FL when we had an encounter with something  well...unknown. We were near a lake when we heard something large in the woods behind us.  When we shined our lights into the woods to see what was making the noises  we heard a series of blunt beating noises  about a second to two seconds apart.  The sound was like that of a wood baseball bat hitting a tree.  This went on from about 30 seconds to a minute before the tree fell.  As we heard the crackling of the falling tree we ran back towards the nearest safe place to us.  At this same time we heard in the woods to our left  something almost stalking our every move.  Once we got to  civilization  and realized we were out of danger  we decided to go back to find out the source of what happened. When we returned  almost an hour later  we found a tree freshly broken in half  the break being about eight feet from the ground.  The break was not a clean cut like that of a hatchet  rather like the tree had been bent to its breaking point.  We knew this was a fresh break from the dripping sap  which next day was dry so it was definitely the source of the noise of a falling tree.  On a branch about seven feet from the ground we found a hair sample.  The hair is still yet to be identified.  The best description we can give is it is a two to two and a half inch light brown hair  which is wavy with a kink close to the middle of it. The tree is about 25 to 30 feet tall.  The break was about seven to eight feet in the air.  At waist  the diameter is about ten inches  and at the break between six and eight inches. Please help us to determine if this was from a known and indigenous species or if it was our distant friend. Also  If there is a credible source to send the hair  to find out its origin  please send us a lab. Thank you. ***A NEW REPORT (37689) OF THIS INCIDENT WAS FILED 11/25/12. THIS IS THE STATEMENT FROM IT. BOTH REPORTS ARE NOW COMBINED. While walking down the dock  the woods next to the dock began moving and shaking violently. We were scared but assuming it could be a bum  we shouted into the woods. Eventually the shaking stopped and a few minutes later  we heard a knocking sound. It sounded like a 4x4 size pieces of wood hitting a tree. The knocking went on for several minutes. We continued to yell trying to figure out what it was. Next  was the scariest part. A tree about 25-30 feet from the dock started rocking violently. Still screaming  the tree fell toward the dock and we started running  the whole time we heard something keeping pace parallel to us on the dock and grunting. We later went back and found a brown/red hair hanging from the bottom of a branch. ,From US1 head west on Wilmette.

976,On the 19th of May 2007 at around 8 30 AM  My Wife and I were on our way to the local bait shop on the Flagler/Volusia county line in central Florida. Our usual route to this shop at Highbridge Rd. is via Old Dixie Hwy through Walter Boardman also known as  the loop . I was turning left off Old Dixie onto Walter Boardman and I looked ahead on the road and saw 2 vehicles approx. 1/2 mile in front of me on Walter Boardman. At that instant behind the vehicle  closest to me I saw a tall  dark figure on 2 legs swiftly cross the road from south to north. The figure that I saw was taller than the vehicle ahead of it and it appeared to cross the road in 3 or 4 stiff-legged strides. I said to my Wife  did you see that ? She replied that she had not as she was looking for something in her purse  by that time it was already in the woods. I sped up to reach the area where the figure crossed the road  my Wife and I scanned the woods where it had disappeared and saw no trace of it. I knew right away that this was not a regular animal or man because it was extremely tall  dark and fast  although it did not appear to be running  the strides covered a great distance.We continued towards our destination and arrived at Bulow Plantation Ruins  a state park where we fish. We mentioned what I had seen to the Ranger who dismissed it as a black bear. I disagree  it was lean and too fast to be a bear walking on hind legs. I wish that I could have gotten a better look up close but I have and will continue to look carefully as I drive  the loop  for another sighting of this very interesting creature. , ,Volusia,12,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12127,yes
977,A friend and I were fishing late into the night and early morning in a remote area in between Ormond Beach and Flagler Beach next to a small bridge on Walter Boardman Lane. The friend of mine noticed a set of eyes shining in the woods while looking down a small trail. We were wearing headband style flash lights and he told me to check it out. As I looked down the trail it was very obvious to me that the eyes were far enough apart and high enough off of the ground to justify being concerned. I convinced myself and my friend that whatever it may be  its more afraid of us than we were of it. A while later  maybe 20 minutes or so  he mentioned that it was still there starring at us. I walked slightly closer to the opening of the trail in an attempt to make out what it may have been  but still couldn  t tell. A few minutes later  same thing... it was still there and still starring towards us. I tried to make noise and decided to yell at it. It apparently wasn  t too concerned b/c it didn  t so much as blink or move. We again convinced ourselves that it was nothing to be afraid of. We continued with fishing and not long after my friend noticed that it had finally moved on. We thought nothing more of it until I got the biggest scare of my adult life. As I was standing there  something let out the deepest  slowest growl that I  ve ever heard in my life. It sounded as though it was standing directly behind me and very close. I turned to look at my friend and the look on his face told me that I was not hearing things. Without a second thought or a spoken word  we dropped our fishing poles and ran as fast as we could to the truck. We jumped in and locked up tight. My first question was if he had heard it and his response was  yes  what was that?  We were so scared that we weren  t sure what to do. The decision was made a couple of minutes later to start the truck and turn on the headlights. He raced the engine and blew the horn repeatedly. Even after a few minutes of doing this and feeling sure that whatever is was had to have left the area  we were still VERY hesitant to retrieve our fishing gear. After a long while of deciding  we very quickly jumped out  THREW our things into the back of the truck  and left. We had both lived in Florida for some time. We spent a lot of time on the water and in the woods  fishing and camping in remote locations. Never before  NEVER  have I heard anything like it. I can say 100% that it WAS NOT an alligator or a bear. Beyond that I have no idea. I do know that whatever is may have been convinced two grown men  both of them  to immediately go out and purchase handguns to carry during each and every future outing! Not sure where the sound clips of the growls come from on the  finding Bigfoot  television series... but they are about the closest thing I  ve heard to the sound I heard that night. The only other detail that stands out to this day is that we had a  buffet  of shrimp  chicken gizzards and livers  and cut up fish sitting on the tailgate of the truck. ,It was a small bridge on Walter Boardman Lane.

978,Me and my buddy were out in the woods hunting in Pierson Florida on ninemile rd we were driving out and I noticed something big and brown in the ditch on the side of the road crouching down then it stood up and walked back and fourth across the road then crouching back down we know for a fact it wasn  t human it was about nine feet tall. ,From the town of Peirson  go north on County HWY 3.

979,I was out in the woods with two of my sons (16 & 18) and as we were leaving I saw some movement didn  t think much of it. As we got up the trail by where I saw movement one of my sons noticed some foot prints  that were larger than normal and right next to some deer tracks. Then my other son described exactly what I saw even though I never described what I saw.

981,I live in Lake Helen  Florida and we have had several incidents that I didn  t put together until I ran across the story of the Cassadaga sightings. My daughter and I share our home with 2 golden retrievers and it  s not uncommon for my female to not want to go outside to do her nightly business for no apparent reason. Now  maybe there is. My daughter and I were in my bedroom around 9pm one night  when something slapped the side of the house so hard it shook. We looked around outside  from inside and saw nothing. 3 days later at around 3 in the morning  my daughter in her bedroom (directly above my bedroom  sharing the outside wall) woke up to a loud  house shaking slam followed by a loud growl. Her feet hit the floor upstairs at the same time mine hit downstairs...We assumed a bear  but never could figure out why a bear would hit the house and how it could hit hard enough to shake the house  waking us both up. ,I-4 to Lake Helen exit 118...five minutes due east ,Volusia,12,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12127,yes
982,July 20th 2021. I was coming home from work and was travelling south down highway 11 in DeLeon Springs FL. It was about 1am and was hot and humid night. Normally I don  t take this road home  but I was curious if I could see any deer along Blackwelder road late at night  as I was interested in hunting at a property on that road. I was in my pickup truck and it does have a bright light bar on it  so as I approached the wooded section of the road  I turned on the lightbar so I could see more of the side of the road  so I could tell if there were deer along the side of the road. I was travelling at about 60 MPH. Right as I flipped on the lightbar  and it shone down the road  I noticed a large creature moving across the road on two legs. I was a good distance from it still. I gradually slowed down from surprise at seeing it. It cleared the road in about two steps and disappeared behind a group of trees close to the road. Once I reached the point where I thought it crossed  I was going probably 30 miles per hour. It didn  t seem to notice the guard rail at all  just went over it in stride it seemed. I could tell right where it crossed because there where big wet footprints on the road. I went up to the boat ramp parking lot and turned around to see if I could go back and see it again. As spooked as I was  I wanted to see it again to confirm what I saw. I slowly went back  keeping my lightbar on. As I passed the area  I could see the place where I believe it went into the woods. There was an area where it looked disturbed at the tree line  like something had just walked into the woods there. There was no sign of the creature. As I approached the footprints  I compared them to the stripes in the road. One footprint was on the dividing line down the middle. It appeared to be about 8 inches wide and maybe twice as long as it was wide. This observation was done while traveling maybe 10 mph so I could be wrong. It was much larger than a human print. I was very spooked by the experience and it didn  t even cross my mind to take a picture of the prints. This was the first time I saw such a creature so my mind was not thinking about documenting it! Here is how I would describe what I saw. It was tall and had reddish brown hair  tending toward brown. The legs looked darker under the knee joints  looking back that was probably cause it was wet. The hair appeared to be long and shaggy. As it crossed the road the arms swung slightly  especially when going over the guard rail. The creature never looked towards me  it was looking towards the other side of the road at the tree line. If I had to guess  it was probably close to 7 or 8 feet tall. It was much taller than any living thing I had seen before. Its chest was large as well  almost like a body builder. I only saw it for a couple seconds as it crossed the road so that is the best I can remember. I really wish I had my dash camera installed at that point. I quickly put one on a couple days after that! Hopefully I will see another one day. ,Approximately at 29.166753  -81.298966. It was just before the boat ramp entrance. ,Volusia,12,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12127,yes
983,Me and my friend were going out into the woods to explore the Apalachicola National Forest  we heard the sound of a stream or creek so we went to go check it out. It was a small and shallow brook layered with 5-10 lbs rocks  so we washed off  cooled down and as we were leaving the brook it was out of sight but not sound  we heard some noises of rocks moving and colliding or being tossed into other rocks. We were nervous of a wild animal. As we approached we heard like a hog running off  only we caught a glimpse of an ape like mammal charging through and away from the brook. The rocks on the bank and in the water were moved and jumbled in a very distinct way.  Because of the leaves  there was no other prints except one upper left side of a left foot imprinted in the mud touching the water.  We tried to preserve it  but as we returned to the cars  the mud had fried and cracked  we had no camera  sorry. ,I cannot remember where we had parked  but we walked almost straight northeast for about 5 or 6 miles. ,Wakulla,1,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12129,no
984,I was on quota for wildhogs in Dupis Forest WEA in South Florida. There was one other person with me on this hunt. We had walked in to a area we call the Intersection it is the junction of forest road and a canal.My buddy was about 150 yds NW of my position and I was at the intersection.It is two to three mile hump into this place. When we left the trail head there were not any other vehicles parked and vehicles are not permitted off the grades.It was 30 minutes till day break and still very dark when got to my spot. I sat there till about thirty minutes after first light till I see thru my scope safely. I stood and scoped north up the canal and then to the east and the south.I moved about fifty yds north and scoped to the north from a mound of dirt over a culvert. I saw two small black hogs 150 to 200 yds north of me so started moving up dike towards them to get a shot. I hadn  t moved very far when I saw in grass on my left what looked like two trail through wet grass. It looked like two people had crossed the field recently side by side. This struck me for two we had very seldom see anyone in our area and they would had to have past by buddy to cross this area. Also there few quotas given out. I walked down get a better look and look for tracks then heard noise behind me across the canal in small cypress head like soft splashing sounds. I moved back up over the dike to the canal and stood still for a couple of minutes looking for movement in the head. IT was still pretty shadowy in the head. I raised my rifle to look through the scope something made sound I have never heard before. I can best describe as hrumpff. I am former Marine Sgt and Desert Shield/Storm Veteran. The Hair stood up on my the back of my neck and I was instantedly on alert. I took a couple of steps back and stood trying to find the source of the sound and could not went down the dike to the mound I mentioned and dropped down the west of it crawled back upto the top laid my pack in front of me rested my rifle on top of it. I spent the next hour watching for movement. I cannot vouch for it leaving out the northside but it did not leave east   west or south. The sound immediately made me feel like it was saying all right that close enough!   I did not mention this to my buddy but I asked if he had seen anyone pass by him and he said no. When we returned to truck there was not any vehicles but ours there. , ,Martin,6,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12085,yes
985,Newspaper article  Sentinel Star (Orlando  Florida)  October 5  1977 LURKING BIGFOOT TRICK OR THREAT? Halloween is still three weeks away but strange creatures are already being seen around Central Florida this week. A 22-year-old hitchhiker reported sighting the legendary Bigfoot  saying the beast was tall  dark and stinky. It lurked in the darkness in a lightly forested area off U.S. 441 half a mile south of Belleview  he said.  I  ve got some information about Bigfoot   the tremulous voice on the telephone said.  I think I just saw it.  Monday morning a security guard for an Apopka nursery told police a 10-foot-tall hairy animal with a chestful of reddish- gray fur and small ears attacked him  ripping off the terrified guard  s shirt. Donnie Hall  27  said he fired several gunshots at the creature in vain. The Bigfoot sighter - a Belleview welder who didn  t want his name known - said the beast was brown and black.  I  m six feet tall and it was bigger than me. It smelled horrible  like garbage.  Neither of the two creature sightings was substantiated. A Florida Game and Fresh Water Commission agent who examined tracks at John  s Nursery in Apopka said they all appeared to be man-made. Marion County Sheriff Don Moreland chuckled about the Bigfoot report.  I  ve been in law enforcement for 20 years here and I don  t remember any reports of monsters. Flying saucers  yes  but I don  t recall any monsters.  , ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12083,yes

987,My hunting buddy dropped me off at the hunting camp entrance.  I was not going to go into the hunting camp  rather decided to hunt along the railroad track bordering the camp along dirt road. We were probably 3 miles deep in a wooded area off main road.  I positioned myself on edge of railroad  with the tracks and very  very thick forrest and swamp bottoms directly in front of me. I had been watching for deer for maybe 30 minutes  when directly in front of me in the thicket maybe 100 feet  sound began to develop.  It was louder than anything I  d ever heard in the wild.  It sounded like a very deep growl/exhale that lasted what seemed like 20 seconds. It happened a second time about a minute later.  This time it sounded closer  but I couldn  t see anything in the thicket.  I remember thinking I probably wasn  t armed with enough firepower  although I was holding a 30-30 highpower rifle in my hand.  I felt as though whatever was making the noise was big and strong based on the powerful noise I was hearing.  I started walking toward where my friend was parked.  He met me walking the dirt road and picked me up.  I told him what I  d heard; he laughed and made jokes.  We left the area and didn  t return until next year to do some scouting in the exact same area. We were without rifles at this time because it was before season started.  When we were walking in the swamp bottom  my friend brought up the incident and laughed some more.  It was no more than 5 minutes later when in front and to the left of us  WE heard the  noise again.  He looked at me like   What the heck was that?  I said   That  s it  that  s it!   We turned and got out of there very quickly.  When we got to the truck  he now believed me with regard to what I  d heard the year before when we were in that exact area.  We left and started driving the dirt road just looking to see if we could see any deer  or any other wildlife that could be walking that afternoon.  As we drove back by the woodline that we had just exited 10  minutes earlier  we noticed on the woodline bordered by a field  we saw what we thought was a deer grazing at about 100-125 yards.  We stopped the truck to watch. My friend decided he would try to get closer by walking the woodline toward the deer.  As I watched him walk slowly toward the animal  I noticed the animal was moving toward him on all fours.  I told him that it was moving toward him.  He stopped and I think either clapped his hands or yelled something.  At that second  this thing stood straight up on two legs. It was white on the underside and had no distinctive shoulders. It looked as though it had a pointed head and we thought it stood about 7-8 feet.  My friend turned and ran back to the truck. We were both scared enough to leave but before leaving we tried to position the headlights toward the subject for better identification.  But it had entered back into the woodline.  We have discussed this many times over the years.  Other people/hunters have told us of encounters in this area.

989,This sighting report was originally submitted by the witness   mother. I contacted the witness and spoke with her about her sighting. She told me that on New Year  s Eve  she and her family were at her uncle  s house shooting fireworks. She and her cousin were playing with cap guns and had wandered towards a wooded area on the back of her uncle  s property. The witness stated that when she looked back into the trees  she could see something very large  standing half behind a tree looking at her and her cousin. She described it as being  furry  with red eyes. Her cousin also saw the creature. They both turned to run back to their parents and the witness said when she turned back the creature was walking away on two legs. She further stated that it was walking funny and appeared to have a limp. When I asked her what she meant by walking  funny  she told me that it walked somewhat like an ape would walk. She and her cousin both ran back to their parents and began telling them about what they  d seen but she said her uncle started making fun of them seeing a  bogeyman . A few minutes later she and her cousin  using a flashlight  went back to see if they could spot the creature again. She said that upon their return  it had apparently left because they didn  t see it. ,East side of Tallahassee. North of Mahan Drive. ,Leon,3,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12073,yes
990,I was about fifteen at the time  traveling with my mom and two younger siblings (brother and sister)  driving from Atlanta to Ft. Myers to visit my grandparents (as we did every December). We stopped in Ocala National Forest â€” I don  t remember the campground because we didn  t get there until after nightfall  and I remember we went to Alexander Springs the next day  which was close by. Anyway  we drove through the campground and picked one of the last spots  several empty camp spaces away from the closest camper. The night was mild (certainly compared to North Georgia)  and we all had sleeping bags  so we just pitched them on the sandy ground under the stars. My mom and my brother and sister were together near the road  but I wanted some space  so I was about ten to fifteen feet away closer to the end of the space. I wasn  t afraid of the outdoors; I had already been whitewater canoeing  spelunking  camping  hiking  etc. I loved to hike  and catching snakes was a particular interest. Anyway  I loved being in the woods  and I knew that even bears are scared of humans  and didn  t think anything would bother us in a camp site  even if we were on the fringe  for there were a dozen or so other campers around  particularly a small group about four or five campsites away who were having a bit of a party. Anyway  it was late  probably around 10 PM  and so we got in our sleeping bags and went to sleep. I dozed off for...I don  t know  maybe an hour...and suddenly woke up. It was pitch black and very quiet  except for the footsteps. At first  I thought it was some big man walking through the saw palmetto; it was definitely bipedal  which is what threw me later. I figured someone was either drunk  looking for a place to pee  or lost. I remember cocking an eye to the trees and could see no light reflected from a flashlight. I remember thinking it odd how someone could navigate the woods in total darkness without a flashlight (which is why I figured it was someone drunk out to relieve himself). After about fifteen or twenty seconds (perhaps a dozen footsteps  crunchâ€¦crunchâ€¦crunch).  I realized it was coming into our campsite; I say IT because I could now hear it breathing  and whatever it was  I realized it was not human. It sounded like something huge  like a Santa Gertrudis bull. I lay very still  listening. Suddenly I heard it very close to my head  no more than a feet away  and it sniffed deeply several times as if it was checking me out. I was suddenly seized with terror  and I have never been afraid like that before. It was an odd reaction; the back of my mind was telling me that it was probably just a bear (the only thing I could think of that would be that big) and that it was simply looking for a pic-a-nic basket. I was wide awake  and I never have had those  night terror  dreams; I was fully conscious. I simply did not want to move. I must have flinched  because whatever it was suddenly went silent. Although I could not hear it  I was certain that it was still there  watching me. After what seemed an extremely long time (it was only about ten or fifteen minutes)  the regular noises of the woods stated to come back  and I could hear small animals rustling about the dried palmetto leaves around the camp. I quickly got up and went over to wake up my mom  and I told her that there was a bear in the camp. She grabbed a flashlight  but all we could see was a short way into the woods around the camp. She laughed at me for being scared of nothing. Well  I went to the car  locked the doors  and lay down in the back seat. I had a hard time going back to sleep. At first light we packed up and headed off to Alexander Springs  and that entire trip my mother teased by about how I was so frightened by an armadillo (yeah  an 800 pound armadillo.) I didn  t think to check for prints (I did run and quickly snatch my sleeping bag where I had left it)  and I neither saw anything nor smelled anything. But I convinced myself that it was a bear  for whatever it was had enormous lung capacity  but it always bothered me that it was obviously walking on two feet  and it left without making a sound. ,Can  t remember; I wasn  t driving  and it was at night when we got to the campground. ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12069,yes
991,I have been interested in this for years because in my family it was taken as fact for most of my life. The reason for this was an incident that happened in the early seventies  1974  I believe. It happened just west of Waukeena Florida off the old St. Augustine road  a dirt road that parallels U.S. 27. My grandmother (now deceased)  my mother  my younger sister and supposedly me (though for some reason I swear I don  t remember it at all) were at a place where people dumped trash. We had thrown some stuff away and were looking at some things that others had tossed. My mother is 80 and still remembers this vividly and so does my sister. My sister says it was a Bigfoot! My Mom tells the story that it was a  big ole hairy hippie!  More like a man than an ape. When she was alive my grandma had a similar story. My Mom says it was a great big man (when I ask how big it was she says WAY bigger than you are...I  m 6  4  320lbs) who was all the way naked (she says you could see it was male) and didn  t have shoes or anything else on. He was hairy all over with tangled reddish brown hair. This happened in full daylight with the creature approaching us from the wood line in an aggressive manner (grunting and making sounds) at a fairly close distance. Everyone retreated to my Grandma  s old Chevy and by the time we got moving we were face to face at smelling distance. My Mom and Sis say it smelled like rotten eggs or meat or something really unforgettably bad. I wanted to tell this story because my mom is 80 years old and I want her side of this to be told. She says it was a man  maybe somebody who is crazy or something. She is an old Hillbilly and has no modern frame of reference. I wish I could remember this event directly myself but can  t. My sister who  s 18 months younger than me recalls it perfectly and they both say I was there. ,There  s a big lake across the dirt road from where this old dump used to be.

992,I was on my way back from a delivery in okeechobee on I 95 near mile marker 158 in when i noticed people hitting their brakes and pointing out to the right upon looking i saw an 8 foot tall hairy creature whose arms were past its waist in lenghth standing upright but shoulders were hunched over it was taking small strides in between the cypress trees behind the fence on the side of the road about fifteen feet into the trees.I couldnt see it face but its whole body was black hair it wasnt thin by any means.I didnt see any features that would have made me feel that it was female..It was about 3 15 P.M on Friday the 21st of January 2012. ,I was traveling north on I 95 ,Indian River,1,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12061,yes
993,My brother had built a hut (fort) in the woods right at the edge of the woods by our home. That morning  my little sister (age 5) and myself (age 9) went out to the hut. It was just after daybreak. The first thing we noticed was the smell. It was awful  very foul. We then heard something large walking through the woods. At this point   I grabbed my sister and ran into the gully behind the hut to hide. After we were in the gully  we heard a growling sound. It would growl for a few minutes and then stop  and then growled one more time. Then we saw this huge thing standing at the edge of the woods. It was very tall  and broad. It was standing there on two legs with a human-like shape. It had hair that was brownish/red in color.This was not a bear. It was standing approximately 50 to 70 feet from us. The trees and bushes were obscurring it a small amount. It walked up to within a few feet of the hut  then turned and walked away. We were terrified. After it left  we ran home. ,Esto Fl. is located right on the Fl.  Al. line in Holmes County. Dothan Al. or Enterprise Al. would be the closest larger cities nearby.

994,In the mid nineteen fiftys I lived in a housing project in Tampa FL. It was called River View Terrace and it was right on the Hillsborough River next to Florida Ave. There was a movie theater on the other side of the river called the Tower Drive-in. One evening after dark  me and a buddy was watching the movie from the projects side of the river  you could not hear the sound from the movie but at least it kept me off the streets. I had moved over from Lakeland FL because my dad had been killed and my uncle was sort of keeping an eye on us  he lived near there on a street called Flora. Well anyway we were deep in watching the movie and we heard something behind us and we both turned and saw a large hariy creature between us and the last lamplight that the projects had to offer. It looked like the common version of the bigfoot stereo-type I see today but back then it just looked like the common ordinary  boogyman   to us. We split and never looked back. ,Within sight of Florida Ave. and the Hillsborough River on the southwest side. ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Unknown ,12057,yes
995,well we were rideing our atv  s and we turnd an corner and in the distince we saw a big black thing   at first we thought it was another atver but as we got closer it started to look like a person cuz it had alot of hair ...he was just standing looking at us then my brother pointed and said  look!  then we all saw him turn and run into the bushes. he was hunched and he was black then we went down there and we didnt see him then we saw footprints and it wasnt just any footprints they were prety big they were about 3 feet and we didnt here anything cuz we had our helmets on and the atvs are pretty loud. ,it was at this place in the woods of lake placid with atv tracks ,Highlands,1,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12055,yes
996,Over an 11 year period I found footprints. Fences repeatedly had barbed wire top lines pushed down to the field fenceing below and wrapped with moss and lodged with sticks. If you took them out they would be back the next morning. One pony regularly had a hand hold twisted in her mane and tied there. My horses would stand by the hour and stareing into the woods off the back corner of the property.At that time there was over four square miles of woods and pastures back in there with no roads. Found footprints in the field. I had roofs removed from dog houses. My neighbor had stock attacked. I had one remembered sighting. My dogs in the kennel started to bark about 2 in the morning and I had to go out to shut them up. as I went out the back door I glanced over to where my mother had a small building for her Chihuahuas. I remember seeing a being sitting on the pile of wood my dad had gathered and thinking.What are you doing here. I went over to the big kennel building and the dogs were so upset I had to go in and shut them up. As I went back over to the place (i was staying that night(we had two places and when my folks went away for the weekend to our other home I would stay on the couch in their place to watch the color tv.) I remember glancing to my right as I passed the wood pile and thinking oh your still here. then I did a stupid thing i went inside and shut and locked the back door something we never did. I went back to bed only to wake up three hours later shaking like a leaf. I can remember calling a friend to tell her what I had seen as I knew this was one person who would not think I was nuts. It had been a large silver colored creature sitting there calmly watching me. I drew a picture of what I saw I do not know if I still have it or not.. That has been my only remembered actual sighting though many times I have felt them around me and heard them. ,Florida.

997,My husband and I were returning home from the store. We were in no hurry so we took the long way around. We liked to see if any new homes were going in. Montura Estates at that time was very scarcely populated.  It is a very large area and then what people that lived there were widely scattered. Very heavy pine woods  palmettos and cypress swamps. It had been raining earlier and still was drizzling off and on. I saw a person come up out of the woods further up the road and start walking in same direction we were traveling. I remember thinking who would be out  walking on a day like that. We were traveling very slow. This person then crossed road in front of us and still continued traveling same way. As we got to where we had to turn we slowed up even more. That  s when I realized that this person was still heading south on Hacienda. He had crossed over Hunting Club Ave that we were turning on. That is when I really looked at this person for there was nothing out that way at all then.  I then saw that there was hair blowing on its legs  long hair.  I then realized that it had hair all over its body. It was black or very dark. Its hair on its head was long and seemed angled to its shoulders. Its arms were held close to its sides. Very big  over 6 ft. tall. 300lbs or more. The trees were very tall and even the palmettos were very thick and tall so I`m not sure how tall. By this time we had come to a complete stop and it was out of sight as we were in the middle of our turn and the trees blocked our view.  I turned to my husband. We hadn`t said a word till then. He said was that what I thought it was?  I said I think so. We backed up but It was gone. We looked down Hacienda all the way to the end and back. We traveled down Appaloosa Ave. We looked for a while but never saw it again. When we returned home we told our children but then we said our eyes must have been playing tricks on us as it couldn`t have been what we thought we saw it must have been a tree along the road. My husband told his aunt and uncle and they looked at us like we were crazy  so again my husband said it was a tree. He never talked about it again. I never told anyone either. Id like to add that when I realized what I was looking at that I was 100-150 feet away. I think it must have heard us when my husband stopped car as the brakes squealed a little. ,off hwy 27 west to CR833 about 7 miles to entrance to Montura Estates.

998, ,I lived just north of Spring Hill on Sunshine Grove Rd by Hexim Rd. near your other report approximately 3 miles. What I saw was seen by 4 or 5 people over  20 to 30 years. By Whitehurst Lake about 2 miles from US 19. I saw a man-like thing approx 7 foot tall. Its arms were longer than a man. Its head was small. It walked labored  swinging its arms. It had no real shape to it that I could tell. Just big. It stopped on the lime rock road for 1 or 2 seconds  then walked toward the lake. I ran the other way. When I told my mother she said that they had seen them for years in the 70  s. ,Hernando,4,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12053,no
999,The incident happened two years ago in the Richloam Hunting Area in centeral Florida. The Green Swamp. My friend and I had been awake for fifteen minutes. We were sitting around the fire. I had just stoked the fire and added some more wood. That is when we heard something walking toward us in the woods. After it came to the road  it continued through the middle of the campsite  which led to the river   and then the other way into the woods. The animal ran down towards the water then turned around  ran back up the road and into the woods. At this time it went on the back side of the campsite.  My friend and I were shocked  we thought it might be a bigfoot but decided to go hunting. Once we got out of the stand we went to go investgate what had happened  and that is when we saw the footprints left in the sand. The foot prints were proably 16  long and far too wide to be human.  There were five toes. ,The incident occurred at the Richloam Wildlife Managament Area in the Green Swamp on the west side of 471 off of center grade (road) back in the campsite. ,Hernando,4,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12053,yes
1000,While on vacation  we were on our way to watch the sunset.  My daughter pointed out her window and said  look! What is that?!   My son sat to her left and I to her right. All three of us looked out the window to see what appeared to be an 8-10 foot tall hairy being. It was standing slightly turned so we were looking at its left shoulder & back. It was very hairy and we could definitely make out a head and shoulders. All three of us had a definite clear  unobstructed visual for 7-10 seconds. It was light brown to tan in color.  About 45 minutes later we were on our way back and it was gone. ,Approximately 50-75yds on the south side of Cortez Blvd just before the intersection at Pine Island Dr heading west on Cortez blvd. ,Hernando,4,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12053,yes
1001,At the time I was only about 9 years old  and my friend was going on a camping trip over in ruskin  fl. it was a weekend excersion just off the Little Manatee River. the first night we just herd funny screems that sounded like it was coming from down river. Not sure what it was so my friends dad loaded me and my friend in the boat and we went to see what it was. We thought someone was in trouble or some thing. We went down river but saw and herd nothing ant thought nothing more about it. THe next night about 2 or 3 a.m. i smelt a God awful oder that woke me up out of a dead sleep. I thought a skunk had invaded our camp (not uncommon in Florida).Slowly I grabbed my flashlight and tured it on. As soon as i clicked the button i herd some thing run through the palm palms  when I shined the light up I saw the upper back and head of a large animal running away. It happend so quik that it was a blurr  but i do know that the hair was a dark brown or black color. I hope this helps you in your search. ,can  t remember.....just off the little manatee river in ruskin ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12057,yes
1002,I got off work around 2am and was going home.I took a left on hopewell road off hwy.39. Made the left turn on the road. As I was driving less than a minute a car heading to me was speeding and flashing there headlight highbeams.I didnt know if it was teens playing around or somebody that had to much to drink so I blew it off.As I was coming to the curve there is a fence maybe 4 to 5 feet tall. as i was going around the curve my headlights caught something that looked to be 3 to 4feet taller than the fence. It looked at me with these red eyes.i felt numb and frighten.I always think about the other person that was driving that night what did they see.The sight has been devloped since then  trees almost gone , ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12057,yes
1003,I went down to Florida with my family while my dad was working there. We didn  t want to stay in a hotel because we had just bought a camper so we decided to go camping. So we stayed at the Hillsborough River State Park. One day I took my bike out around 2 in the afternoon. The camp had a few trails to ride on so I decided to take one. As I was riding my bike  I stopped and looked over the ledge at a few alligators I spotted. I heard a rustle in the trees and thought maybe it was a gator so i got steady on my bike and got ready to take off. As I was looking around I noticed a tall dark brown hairy figure just standing there looking at me. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I looked harder at it and It took off running. I would also like to note that it was running on two feet  not four. I rode my bike back to my camper as fast as I could and elaborately told my mother and my sister that I just saw Bigfoot. They both claimed I was crazy and told me it was a black bear because the camp guide told us not to leave food out because they had some of them in the area. But I am most certain that this was not a bear. this  Thing  stood at least 7 1/2 feet tall and ran upwards on two feet. I know what I saw and ever since then I  ve been fascinated with this creature. I know its out there! ,It was at the Hillsborough River State Park on one of the bike trails ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12057,yes
1004,I  a female lady  was driving on a clear day on I75 in the afternoon on a spring day from Sarasota to Tampa going north 65 to 70 miles per hour on the far right lane. This would be on the east side of I75. I had to take an exam in Tampa the next day so I know the exact date I was traveling. My window was slightly open on the passenger side to let the fresh air in. I was driving on the far right side of the highway in a heavily tropical wooded area when I saw what I first thought was a man walking fast about 50 feet away from the highway in like a grassy meadow with thick brush or tropical woods behind him. As I got closer I saw that it was not a man but a creature that looked like a man but with (approximately) three inch long brown hair covering it  s body from head to foot. When I was parallel to the creature it quickly went into the brush/wooded area and disappeared. It looked like tall thick brush or woods. The creature looked like a male around I am guessing 6 to 7 feet tall with a thick body  thick legs  wide shoulders. I could see the brown body hair as it turned it  s whole body all at once  bent its head  and went into the brush/woods. It was going north the same direction as me and walked quickly with wide steps with knees bent before it turned into the brush or woods. As I drove off I couldn  t get over what I just saw. It happened in about 30 seconds. My car smelled like rotten eggs  sulphur  or just a strange awful odor for about 10 minutes after. I was not afraid. It did not look scary just really strange. It happened so fast and without warning. ,To the right (east) side of I75 going North after where I275 exit to St. Petersburg crosses  about 10 miles north of there near Little Manatee River State Park. There is a small bridge on I75  I witnessed the sighting either before or after the small highway bridge near Manatee River State Park. I was driving on the far right lane going about 65 or 70 miles per hour. I hope no one tries to hurt it or capture it. Maybe it is best not to post the exact location online for the benefit of the creature. ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12057,yes
1005,I was leaving saint petersburg with the intentions of hitch-hiking to asheville  nc. I had a friend drop me off at the I-75N XX exit around 11 pm. there was a lot of construction going on and since it was getting late I decided to camp for the night. I walked to the bridge that crosses the XX river. I was planning on sleeping under the bridge  I walked down underneath  got myself comfortable then I heard a couple of noises to the left of me (coming from the southbound bridge)I played it off as a possum or raccoon  then I heard it again.. so I decided to move closer to the river and hang my hammock in between two trees. I was texting people  then called my friend and talked to her until about 2 30 then we got off since my phone was about to die. I went to sleep pretty quickly afterwards... but not for long. I woke up to a noise down by the river to my left. it was a weird cough/grunt that I can  t really explain. I can  t mimic the sound but I only heard it once. 10-15 minutes later I hear another sound  this time a low whistle from my right  next to the tree line. it lasts 5 or 6 seconds. I continue to lay there in silence. another 10-15 minutes go by and I start hearing rocks being thrown at me  this happened 5 or 6 times  every couple of minutes or so. then more silence... not sure how long it lasted but it was followed by the loudest crash I have ever heard. I thought the tree I had tied my hammock to cracked. I almost fell out. it sounded like thunder/gunshot/dynamite going off in my face. after that I made up my mind to leave  quickly packed up my hammock and headed back up the hill. crossing the bridge  I caught a quick whiff of a skunk like smell and can feel a set of eyes on me. after that I decided to catch the bus back to NC. , ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12057,no
1006,First  Iâ€™ll start with the fact that I have never put much stock into the Bigfoot phenomenon.  I have degrees in wildlife management and wildlife biology and I have been working as a biologist for the last 17 years.  I have never believed that something could exist that has never left any concrete evidence.  Furthermore  nothing similar has ever been found in the fossil record that I know of so that has lead me to believe it was all false  until this weekend (Nov 24  2013). I am an avid birdwatcher and wildlife photographer.  I take very long hikes in various wild areas around Tampa this time of year to photograph whatever I find. I was hiking at Cypress Creek Preserve which is in between interstate 275 and 75 near the apex where they meet. I was walking on one of the rather wide trails and I came to a stop because I heard a noise.  I had seen quite a few wild pigs that morning and I thought I could photograph one crossing the trail in front of me.  I was looking down at my camera adjusting the ISO settings and I saw something large move out of the corner of my eye (to my left) approximately 200 feet away. As soon as I saw the movement I looked directly at it and it was already halfway across the trail at this point. My eyes were directly on the animal as it walked  upright  across the rest of the trail and into the palmettos. It was very large (at least 6 feet tall or more) completely black in color with a VERY wide chest from front to back.  It was walking completely upright with a very fast  purposeful pace. The animal was leaning forward slightly but did not seem awkward with its steps - like a bear would be while walking upright. I slowly walked over to the spot where I saw it cross and I could still hear it moving through the woods in the distance.  I immediately noticed that all the birds around me had stopped chirping and the insects had stopped making noise as well.  I looked for tracks or hair left on the plants in the area but found nothing.  I was able to get a picture of the palmetto on the trail where it crossed and I put my tripod near it for a height comparison. I am extremely knowledgeable about the wildlife in Florida but I cannot explain what type of animal I saw this past weekend. ,Cypress Creek nature preserve between interstates 275 and 75 near the apex where they meet.  The sighting was about a mile due west of Freedom High School. ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12057,yes
1007,My husband and I live in Florida in Hillsborough County next to the wildlife preserve.  One day about 2 weeks ago we were traveling on highway 301 and I saw a sign that said Dead River [Road]. I glanced to look at the river as this was in broad daylight.  What I saw I  ll never forget.  I didn  t even believe in bigfoot before this.  I saw a big white furry animal standing straight up like a human crossing over the stream. We were traveling fast on the road so we couldn  t just stop.  I told my husband I just saw an animal as I was in shock about what I saw.  He didn  t see it as he was driving.  It took me two days to realize I just saw a bigfoot.  I think I was in shock about what I had seen. ,We were going north. ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12057,yes
1008,There is without a doubt a Bigfoot in Chito Nature Preserve Itâ€™s extremely foggy out tonight. We are having the first real cold front coming into central  Florida. My location is Lithia Florida near Chito Park. I without a doubt heard a whooping noise and a loud prolonged Bigfoot yell. It was made in three separate calls getting louder than the last one. The last call was very loud. The first call almost sounded like a owl hoot but as it got louder I could tell it was coming from Chito park. Thereâ€™s no way I could hear an owl call that far away and the last two were dead on/textbook Bigfoot calls. It happened at 10 30p.m. As the local temperature shifted. ,Chito Nature Preserve - there are tens of thousands of acres out there less than 1/5 of a mile from my location. ,Hillsborough,11,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12057,no
1009,My sister  one late night was coming from work in Geneva  Alabama.  She was passing thur another rural community not far from our home  in Holmes Co. Fl. She said she saw something ahead of her about 300 feet big and hairy standing near the road and the closer she got it moved away from the highway into the woods. She slowed down to see if it was a man  of course it wasn  t and she thought from a far  it had on a light green arm jacket with long hair  flowing over it  but it wasn  t a arm jacket at all. But it was covered in hair. stood over 6 to 7 feet tall. She needless to say  made sure she chose a different way home to avoid another encounter or never break down. ,The road in between Geneva  Alabama and the Rural community of Sweet Gum Head  Florida. ,Holmes,11,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12059,yes
1010,Me and my friend were planning on camping out in the woods near my uncles house  near an old well where a old house used to be. It was march and it was just starting to warm up around the area and well we setup camp and head back to my uncles house  it was about a three minute ride by four wheeler. We get some food and tell him we are turning in for the night so we head back to the site. It was about 6 30 when we get to the tent. We get a good fire going and talk for an hour or two. we get in the tent at about 8 30 or so. About an hour or so later my friend wakes me and he tells me to listen and it sounded like big thuds and tree limbs breaking. It almost sounded like it was circling the or site. It couldnt have been about 40 or 50 feet away. But the woods are so thick back there we couldnt figure out what it was. It sounded like it was getting closer. My friend was laying in front of the tent opening and sounded like it was 5 ft away. It got quite and we are trimbiling. and then we heard deep grunts almost like a gorilla it was very strange. Then it sounded like it was moving away from us going towards a bottom. There is a creek that runs through there and it sounded like whatever it was it was headed that way. We looked at each other and my friend had tears in his eyes. We never went back to sleep that night and we were to scared to leave. As soon as the sun was peeking thriught the trees we took off to my uncles and told him what happened and he could tell we were upset. We take him back down to the tent and look around but we found nothing. The ground was to hard to leave foot prints and it was covered in pinestraw and leaves. I have nor my friend has ever experinced any thing like that in our lives. We only told my uncle about what happened until now. ,I would rather not say. If what was my land then i would but it is my uncles place and i have to honor his request in not saying the specific location but our camp site was on ten mile creek  just off highway 2 ,Holmes,11,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12059,yes
1011,It was just at twilight. I was sitting waiting to turkey hunt. I  ve heard the howls on here but this was different. It sounded higher in pitch all most like a child making the sound. A few minuets later I heard it again. Whatever it was was far off. I was hoping to hear a deeper answer but didn  t. At first I thought it was some child calling cows or something  but it was too early for that. I  ve heard that before. ,Near Pea River. ,Holmes,11,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12059,no
1012,Less than one mile from home  driving to work going west on FL route 2   the car windows were closed with the air conditioning on and the radio was playing.  On the north side of the road just outside of a pine tree farm  a large animal had started crossing the road.  It was down on all fours  and it looked like a giant foot stool.  It was reddish-brown with long hair  the head sat directly on its shoulders  but the face was looking away from me up the hill. The chest was flat like a human  not curved down like a large dog or bear.  I was surprised to see the animal glide across the road  for I didnt see its knees bend and it wasnt in a hurry.  It crossed to the south side of the road and disappeared into the thicket  which composed most of the south side of the road  with Ten Mile Creek at the bottom of the hill. ,Directions are for you study  not internet- ,Holmes,11,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12059,yes
1013,It happened about 10 or 12 years ago. Myself  nephew and an elderly family friend Terry  were in this swampy wooded area fishing. They were in a small boat  no motor just paddles. As they were fishing they heard something walking in the woods. They looked to see what it was because it seemed to loud for a deer. They saw something walking up right covered with gray hair. The lower part of the animal was blocked by bushes  but they saw all they wanted to see and said it stood about 7 to 8 feet tall. The creature was 70 to 80 ft. from the witnesses. The creature had very large eyes. ,About 3 miles west of Greenwood  FLorida then about 1 mile off of County Rd. ,Jackson,47,Florida ,FL,Unknown ,12063,yes
1014,It was fall of 2006 - Hunting season and I was in the woods on a farm in Ashville  FL.  I had been in the tree stand approximately 2 hours and not seen any deer.  I have been hunting most of my life and am familiar with the woods  sounds and environment.  Approximately 4 30 pm as the light was fading  I heard two loud  distinct  cries  or  yells  that I have never heard before or since.  I could tell the general direction and distance was approximately 150 -200 yds in front of me.  As I sat there looking  the wind was blowing at my back so I did not notice any unusual smell  but anything downwind from me may have smelled me.  About 10 minutes later I heard the  yell  again.  Possibly a bit closer ~ 125 yds.  I remember a large Oak tree about 50 - 75 yds in front of me.  There was a small sapling (8 - 10 ft tall) next to the large tree  with surrounding grasses about 2-3 ft tall.  About 10 min after the last yell I noticed the sapling being whipped back and forth.  I took special notice due to being on  alert  from the noise - and further the sapling was violently shaking side to side - not in a constant direction.  Almost like something grabbed the tree near the base and started to  push / pull creating a whipping effect near the top.  I looked at the tall grasses surrounding the area and they were not blowing in the same manner.  This tree appeared to be moved by something. I thought at first it may have been a squirrel that jumped on the sapling - but it shook for about 30-60 seconds - then stopped  then again for another 30 seconds.  Since I did not see anything  I sat there (somewhat in disbelief) armed with a high powered rifle. After a few minutes I was so un-easy I got down and slowly exited the woods. ,A farm very close to 146 & Hwy 221 intersection - Ashville  FL. ,Jefferson,56,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12065,no
1015,After reading your reports from Florida  s Lake County I must put down something that happend to me as a child. We had been staying near Lady Lake close to the Griffin Chain of Lakes. We were staying with my grandparents in early 80 or 81. It was late in the evening and everyone was in bed. I had a room on the front of the house by myself. I hear a noise outside my window and we too scared to look. I was about 10 or 11. There were many different sounds  from growling and snorting to footsteps. Again I didn  t look and stayed in bed awake for a couple of hours. The noises only last about 5-10 minutes. I went outside as soon as I woke up in the morning and found an intersting item. My brother and I had piled up sand in the dirt driveway the day before. This morning there were 2 large footprints in the sand pile.  I showed the tracks to my family and they all played it off as a fluke or a neighborhood kid goofing off. I can  t think of too many kids with feet that big. I measured them with a tape and they were about 17  long and 8-10  acrossed. I do believe stronger today that this was a bigfoot. We were very close to an old saw mill and very close to forest and lake areas that had some secluded areas. ,The area was on Hartsock Sawmill RD off of 441/27 ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12069,no
1016,At the time  I lived in Umatilla  Florida.I used to work on CB radios and such and occasinally a deputy would stop by my little shop at my house and we would shoot the bull. One nite a deputy stopped and said they had a Bigfoot sighting in the Ocala National forest  and being the curious type  I asked where and he told me. The next morning 6/30/1980  I got a friend of mine and decided to go and see if we could find the prints. We stopped at the hardware store and I bought  some plaster of paris. Already had the buckets in the Jeep. When we arrived we could see where casts had previously been taken  we decided to look further. So  we drove further thru the woods and had to cross a pretty deep creek to get to the other side  where the road continued  if you want to call it a road. I stopped the jeep and we got out to look around and LOW AND BEHOLD  there were prints coming from a clear cut area (where trees have been cut down and removed)  across the sandy road and leading into the swamp. It had stopped at the edge of the road and must have eaten bay tree blossoms because up about 10 to 12 feet in the tree you could see where it took the blossoms and there were pieces of the blossoms on the ground. The prints were about 4 to 5 feet apart when it walked  and about 1 to 2 inches deep. As I walked or tried to walk in its stride  it was a stretch for me as I  m a pretty big man myself  6ft.3in. I actually put my foot in its prints as i walked deeper into the swamp. The further I got the deeper the prints went into the ground and my foot and leg went all the way to my groin area  this thing was BIG. I took 2 casts and gave one to my buddy and I kept one  which I still have.There is NO DOUBT IN MY MIND after seeing what I saw and casting the prints that this DOES EXIST. ,Northwest of Alexander Springs about 5 miles.Its a pretty Dense area of woods and swamp. ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12069,yes
1017,Newspaper Article   Chronicle (Houston  Texas)  July 2  1980  POLICE THINK MYSTERY FOOTPRINTS ARE FAKES  ALTOONA  Fla. (UPI) - Most investigators figure its a hoax  but there is enough doubt in their minds to order casts made of the size 18 footlike prints found in a remote area of the Ocala National Forest.  I think its a hoax   said Doug Sewell  chief investigator for the Lake County Sheriff  s department.  There was no indication that something big enough to make those prints went back through the woods.  Less sure  however  is Lake County Sgt. Dee Kirby  called out to make casts of the half dozen 17-inch-by-6 1/2-inch footprints found near a bulldozer in the vicinity of Camp Ocala  a federal job training site. He said the prints showed a definite arching of the instep. five distinct toes and even some wrinkling along the instep.  (The prints) had a full four feet of distance between each of one   he said  speculating that if they were real the creature that made them must be 10-to-12 feet tall and weigh close to 1 000 pounds. The prints were discovered by a private contractor doing roadwork for the U.S. Forestry Service. Forestry officials also made casts of the prints  but doubted if they would investigate further. Informal speculation centered on whether the creature was the infamous  skunk ape  - Florida  s own version of Bigfoot and the abominable snowman - reportedly last sighted in the Everglades. , ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12069,yes
1018, I no longer live in Lake Co. but I lived there from 1985-1999. I was working the night shift at a local hospital in Leesburg and lived out near Lake Jem area. I was on my way home about 11 15 one night and just ahead of me I saw the HUGE blackish brown creature run across the road. I slowed for a bit and it ran into the trees not far from the subdivision where I lived.  I said to myself at the time.. what was that? A bear?? Do they run upright?? I got home and mentioned it to my husband (now deceased) and he just blew it off as nothing so I never mentioned it again until he had passed away and I moved to where I live now. I was talking with a dear friend who really is into the bigfoot movement and she told me that it HAD to be a bigfoot as bears do not run upright and really I guess I knew that.  That night that I saw it  as I continued down the road and turned into my subdivision I had my car window down and I definately could smell a stench that I had never smelled before. At the time I did not know much about the bigfoot but my dear friend has since educated me and I am totally convinced   especiallly since reading this article on Lake Co. Bigfoot that I was fortunate enough to have encountered one. Thank you for your research and positive reinforcement. I can not remember if this happened late 1985 or very early in the year of  1986 but I believe it was late (oct-dec) 1985 ,The sighting was on the highway between Tavares and Lake Jem and I was almost to our subdivision.

1019,I  VE NEVER TOLD MY STORY IN A PUBLIC FORUM  ONLY TO A FEW PEOPLE  BUT BACK IN 1993  ME AND A FRIEND WERE COMING BACK FROM A CITY WHERE HE STAYED  (EUSTIS FL)  TO (LEESBURG)  WHERE I USE TO STAY AND HE WAS COMING TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT OUR HOUSE  BECAUSE WE HAD A BAND TOGETHER AND WE WERE GETTING READY FOR A FEW UPCOMING SHOWS. TO LET YOU KNOW  WE STAYED IN THE WOODS  BUT ANYWAYS  WE REACHED THE DIRT ROAD TO OUR HOUSE  AND WHEN MY FRIEND DWAYNE  WHO WAS DRIVING  TURNED TO GET ONTO OUR DIRT ROAD  I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD UP AHEAD. I DIDN  T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING JUST IN CASE I WAS MISTAKEN  BUT WHEN DWAYNE SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES  THEN I KNEW THAT I WASN  T GOING CRAZY. NOW  I DON  T KNOW ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE ON HERE  BUT HE AND I  GOT A CHANCE TO SEE THIS THING UP- CLOSE AND PERSONAL  NO MISTAKING. THERE IT WAS  A BIG CREATURE STANDING  SMACK  RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. I WOULD SAY THAT OUR CAR WAS ONLY ABOUT 10-15 FEET AWAY FROM THIS THING. AT FIRST DWAYNE  DID NOT HAVE ON HIS HIGH BEAMS  AND SO I TOLD HIM TO TURN THEM ON. NOW  LISTEN  WITHOUT THE HIGH BEAMS WE SAW THIS THING VERY CLEAR  BUT IMAGINE WHEN WE DID TURN THEM ON! BY THE WAY  DWAYNE  WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE AREAS MOST FEARED GUYS  BUT IF YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS GUY AND HOW SCARED HE WAS  YOU WOULDN  T HAVE BELIEVED IT. HE KEPT SCREAMING   THAT  S THE DEVIL   AND HE MUST HAVE SAID THIS  AT LEAST  10 TIMES! TO LET YOU KNOW WE  RE BOTH PREACHER  S KIDS AND TRUST ME THIS WAS NOT WHAT I NEEDED TO HEAR AT THAT TIME.  AS A MATTER OF FACT  THAT  S NOT SOMETHING I NEED TO HEAR ANYTIME!  I WOULD SAY THAT WE SAT THERE LOOKING AT THIS THING FOR ABOUT 2-3 MINUTES AND ALSO WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO GET PAST IT. WE WANTED TO HURRY AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY AT THE HOUSE WAS ALRIGHT. THIS THING WAS HUGE IN SIZE AND HAD TO BE ABOUT 8 TO 9 FEET TALL. IT  S EYES WERE LIKE CICLE ORANGE RINGS. IT STOOD STANDING  MOVING IT  S HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE  AS IF IT WERE TRYING TO FIGURE US OUT. IT HAD THE HAIR ON MY BODY STANDING STRAIGHT UP! IT WASN  T UNTIL I HOLLERED TO DWAYNE  TO STEP ON IT  WHEN WE SAW THIS THING FINALLY MOVE. AND WHEN HE MOVED  IT WAS LIKE HE MOVED IN SLOW MOTION  IT WAS REALLY CRAZY!!! WHEN WE GOT TO THE HOUSE IT WAS LIKE A STAMPEDE  BECAUSE WHEN WE GOT IN TO THE HOUSE  YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE ON THE RUN FROM THE POLICE ! EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE WAS SCARED AFTER WE TOLD THEM WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE. WE WERE AFRAID TO TO CALL THE COPS  BECAUSE WE DID NOT WANT THEM TO THINK THAT WE WERE CRAZY  AND SO WE KEPT QUIET. WE DIDN  T NEED ANYBODY TELLING US THAT WE MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DRINK OR WE HAD BEEN SMOKING SOMETHING. I  VE NEVER  EVER  SMOKED ANYTHING  NEVER HAD AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE  OR EVER TAKEN A DRUG  BESIDES WHAT DOCTOR PRESCRIBED. THE REASON WHY I  M TELLING MY STORY NOW IS BECAUSE  EVERY-NOW-AND-THEN  I STILL HAVE  FLASH BACKS  OF THIS AND I CAN  T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. IT  S BEEN BOTHERING ME SO BAD LATELY  THAT I HAD TO GET ON-LINE AND DO A SEARCH ON THIS TO SEE IF ANYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT. WE  RE TALKING 15 YEARS AGO AND THIS IS STILL FREAKING ME OUT! ANYWAYS  THIS IS HOW I FOUND YOUR SIGHT. WE  RE SO FOR SURE ABOUT WHAT WE SAW  THAT WE WILL TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST. ALSO  AS A  CHRISTIAN   AND A BELIEVER IN (JESUS CHRIST)  I DON  T THINK IT WOULD WE BE WISE FOR ME TO LIE ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1020,It was a weekend in October on a Friday night. My girlfriend and i decided to go to Alexander Springs camping for the weekend. We were living in Ormond Beach  Florida  approx. one hour from Alexander Springs. This was a spur of the moment idea that friday afternoon. We rushed around to pack our 4 man tent  lawn chairs  coolers and get groceries for the weekend and a case of oysters. We headed for the springs and we were in a hurry to get there in plenty of time of daylight so we could set up our tent. By the time we got our tent set up it was turning to dusk. We realized we had forgotten to buy firewood so we went into town to purchase a load of wood that would fill the trunk of the car. By the time we got back it was dark. The campground had some lighting for safety purposes I guess incase one had to walk to the bathroom  shower facillities. We started a fire and we also began cooking steaks on the grill and eating oysters and other snacks. We had plenty of food to last the weekend packed in our cooler. We ate our food  cooked on the grill then played cards till about 3 00am. We decided to quit and go to sleep so we could get up early to check out the sights. My girlfriend fell asleep right away and I layed there for about a half hour with a headache and coudn  t go to sleep. I was listening to what sounded for sure like raccoons chattering around our site  figured they may be looking for crumbs. Suddenly the noise of raccoons stopped and everything was silent. I thought it was strange such a sudden silence and I smelled what semed to be the sent of a skunk. I thought that was strange because i had been living in Florida 20 years and never smelled a skunk. I thought there were no skunks in Florida. I sat up thinking i would go outside the tent and see what was going on  when i looked to my right i saw a shadow cast on the tent from the lighting in the campground  what looked to be like a man and my first thought was  surely no other campers would take our food in the night.  It made a noise that i questioned was a bear but didn  t sound like any bear noise I had ever heard and I  m originally from upper Michigan near the Great Lakes very remote area with alot of bears and had seen and heard many in my life. Then i got to thinking this figure was standing up and not on all fours and was so tall I thought it couldn  t have been a man stealing our food. There were not many campers on the grounds that night either. At first I was approaching the door of the tent to go out and investigate when i heard the strange noise again. It sounded like a grunt noise. I did not feel this was a bear but couldn  t imagine what it was  I was somewhat frozen in fear for a minute. Then I started talking to my girlfriend  trying to wake her up and she was scared. We only had one small flashlight and no weapons as we sat there stating we wish we had a gun   so i did not go outside of the tent  but could not go to sleep that night. The next morning at early daylight we came out of the tent to find a mess. Our coolers had been ransacked  most food gone. I attributed this to the raccoons but realized they were not there long enough to make such a mess i didn  t think. So we just laughed about it most of the day and joked about Bigfoot but never did we actually think that was what may have been outside of our tent and eating our food  We had to go in to town for more groceries that day. Late that night things felt strange and it had been lightly raining all day  to a heavier rain by nightime. we sat in the tent playing cards talking about this thing i saw outside the tent. We decided to get out quick  packed our stuff up and even left the tent. At work a couple days later i asked a friend at work who had been there the week before camping if she had ever seen any bear there and she said yes. But when i told her what i saw she said it sounded too weird. It took a few days before i unpacked the car and then realized we had left behind the tent. I called the Ranger at Alexander Springs and told them we had left our tent. They stated they wondered what had happened to us. We told them to keep the tent or dispose of it. They said they could store it for us till we came back again. We told them we didn  t think we would be back anytime soon to go ahead and do what ever they wanted to with it.  We did not tell them of our experience and I never told anyone because i thought they would think I was crazy. When I came across this site i was hesitant to report it but my girlfriend has encouraged me too. I know that what i saw was not a bear and way to tall to be a man or even a tall man. ,West on st road 40  just past Astor  turn off to the left on 19  it is in the East side of the Ocala Nat.

1021,My second night on the Florida expedition  I set up my camp in the hot area and had one of the most terrifying nights of my life. For the first two hours after dusk  I was by myself and heard what seemed to be three large animals  breaking branches and knocking on trees all around my camp; they moved in what sounded like a triangular pattern  came between me and my vehicle  which was only 20 yards away  and broke a branch that had to be thicker than my wrist. Later in the evening  we heard a very strange  gurgling sound that sounded like nothing I have ever heard before. All this was followed by a 25 second tree-knocking session that would have amazed anyone who heard it. These sounds had to be made by an animal with opposable thumbs; if they were made by humans  they would have had to have been able to navigate one nasty swamp in pitch black dark with the speed and agility of a cat. The guys that camped at that site the next night had audio recorders and got some. As for me we had one low quality tape recorder that didn  t pick up more than the wind. I have since obtained a bird call digital recorder with mic. The next trip will be easier because we confirmed the area to focus on last time. , ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12069,no
1022,The incident that my friend and I experienced was weird but not uncommon. It was a follow-up trip from a BFRO expedition and just lasted the weekend. There were about 12 expeditioners and it was in Central Florida. The first night didn  t see much action. The next day which was saturday was when a friend and I decided to check out a location where sightings had previously occurred. We all visited this location before and saw or heard nothing. On this day we drove up to the sight because my friend had not been there. As soon as we got out of our vehicle we heard a loud whack! We both looked at each other and nodded our heads. About 20 seconds later we started to hear rythmic knocks. My friend was quite shocked at what he was hearing. That was when we decided to get out the baseball bat. I told Matt that whatever we heard responded back the same way we did. As this went on I decided to go out and investigate. That was what we were there for so I walked around the area. I saw no tracks or anything around the sandy areas so I decided to go beyond this area into the woods. Matt and I kept radio contact the whole time. Another member of our trip was also monitoring our conversation from a couple of miles away. Once I got into the woods there was alot of fallen leaves on the ground and every time I took a step I made alot of noise. The freaky part is that when I would stop I could distinctly hear something moving about 60 yards in front of me. It sounded bipedal and it  s steps were louder than mine. Meanwhile back at the truck  Matt was still hearing knocks. I kept making excuses fot what it could be. There was a slight breeze blowing through so I figured maybe the trees close together were maybe bumping. That excuse went out the window when the knocks turned rythmic. Also the walker I heard made me assume that maybe possibly I was walking onto someones property. My other friend who was listening to our talk stated that the whole area was nothing but woods and eventually I would run into a lake. He knew this because his cabin was only a mile or so away. The walking continued fot about 8 to 10 minutes. After it stopped I decided to book. I thought it unwise for me to wander further into the woods alone. As soon as I got back Matt stated that the knocks had also stopped. The remainder of the trip went pretty dry. We have established our own Florida chapter and will have to follow-up on this sight. ,We all expeditioners know it as the sinkhole and it is near FR 445 N. ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12069,yes
1023,To this day I cannot honestly say this was a sighting or not. I will leave that conclusion to those with more knowledge of Sasquatch behavior to decide. At the time my knowledge of Sasquatch  Bigfoot or the skunk-ape was limited only to what I had seen on t.v. or read in the papers rarely. In fact  I was under the belief that the Patterson tape had been debunked and bigfoot was probably a myth. It was a clear March day and I being off from work decided to take a day hike in Rock Springs State Park. The park is not heavily used I think mainly because its reputation for a healthy black bear population keeps city dwelling day hikers well clear of it. I have hiked many time in bear country and the idea of a bear encounter wasn  t a worry. I decided on a loop trail approximately 2 miles in length basically as a warm up then planned on hiking different parts of the area. The woods very basically slash pine and palmetto with clear scrub meadow and shallow swamp areas a little deeper in. A well defined trail led through the palmetto. About 1/2 a mile in I noticed the woods had become very quiet and I began to feel as if I was not alone but being watched. In the middle of the trail I came upon a very large of very fresh scat. It was directly centered in the middle of the trail and the stools were incredibly large and long approximately 3 having lengths of between 9 and 11 inches. This was not bear scat as I have seen piles of that before and never saw continuous lengths of stool such as this. Again feeling that I was not alone I developed the strangest feeling that this was there for me to find and that it was meant as a warning not to go further. The fear I felt became almost irrational but I had no doubt I should turn around and leave this area. I have spent many hours in the woods but had never felt this type of flight or fight feeling. I now know that primates have used scat to mark territory and warn others away. Could this have been a warning left by a primate to me? I honestly don  t know. ,SR 46 west.

1024,Hello  I contacted someone from your organization about a year ago regarding my encounter in central Florida back in the middle 80s. I was called away to work and was unable to continue with the call. With that said  I would like to finish sharing my experience. I was working as a fence contractor in central FL during the 80s. We had obtained a job to build 10 feed plots for deer in a remote area off of hwy. 44 near the Blackwater Creek area of the Wekiva River Basin. The acreage is vast and was utilized for big game hunting. Since there was a deadline  we had all of the fence material trucked in and we set up camp at the end of the access road. This allowed us to be onsite until all work was complete. On the second day of our stay  we (myself and a helper) were surveying and clearing a fence line in the early morning hours  it was still misty with little light coming through the trees. There was four of us total working  so we split up into two teams to knock out the 10 plots. While my helper and I were clearing brush we were commenting and joking about an odd odor (skunky/sulfer like) we had been smelling a few minutes before reaching the site of the first plot. As we were pulling a string line  abruptly  a dark  bipedal form stepped into our fence line about 60 yards ahead of us. At first we thought it was one of the installers working with us  but as it moved closer to the clearing you could clearly see it was not a human. It appeared to be mostly covered with orange/brown hair  un-human long arms and an odd shaped head (wide  pointy and large) with a very short neck. Once it stepped out  it seen us as well  and when we shouted out the names of the other workers it quickly vanished into the treeline. We viewed the creature for what seemed to be 60 seconds or so before it bolted off. My helper and I were stunned at what we had seen. We spent a few minutes trying to rationalize it but there was no doubt we witnessed something extraordinary. I was carrying a side arm so we walked up to the clearing but could not see anything through the trees  however we did hear something moving rapidly away from us for a few seconds. That was the first of two encounters. The second encounter happened on the fourth night of our stay. All four of us were at camp which was set up on the bank of Blackwater Creek  about 15 feet from the waters edge. That area of the creek is approximatly 12 feet in width from bank to bank. We had began to cook dinner and were still carrying on conversations about our sighting of a hairy creature two days prior  with the other installers ribbing us saying we must had been drinking on the job and such. There was a cooler that we had tied to a rope and placed in the creek to keep the contents cool. As we were eating a loud splash from across the creek startled everyone. One of the other installers ran down to the creek and found that our cooler was gone  as well as the rope and stick it was tied to. We all walked down to the creek bank but there was no sounds other than the normal water movement. The missing cooler was chalked up to raccoons or an alligator. As we settled back into eating  one of the guys walked away to relieve himself  as he returned to the truck everyone looked at him  he was silent and all the color was gone from his face  he just looked at me and said  I  m sorry  I will never doubt anything you tell me again  ever . Not sure what he meant at the time  I asked him what happened  he quietly turned and pointed  saying  someone or something was standing on the other side of the creek watching me pee . It was obvious he was actually scared speechless. I grabbed a spotlight and we all walked down to the spot where he was standing. As I was hitting the treeline with the light there was no sight of any movements  eyeshine or anything so I stepped as close to the waters edge as I could. As soon as I turned the light back on and the beam hit the other side of the creek  we heard a loud grunt  almost similar to a pig  I panned to our left and that  s when it all happened. A large bipedal  hair covered animal stood up from behind a group of palmetto bushes. It stood fully erect  the light shine of the eyes were almost gold  it reacted to the light hitting its eyes like a person would  by throwing it  s forearm up in front of its face  let out a chilling sound (not a grunt  more like a short howl) unlike anything any of us had heard  it then turned and fled  vanishing like before. All of that happened in just seconds and all four of us witnessed it. We immediately packed up our gear  went to a motel and stayed at the motel until the job was finished. Three of us later went to the FL fish and wildlife office and reported what we had seen. It was during that report when I first heard the term  skunk ape  or even that there had been other sightings of this type. I can honestly tell you  without any doubt  it was not mistaken identity. I grew up as a hunter and outdoorsman and I know what bears look like and also how they act in the wild  it was not a bear  it was definately a primate of some type. Till this day I am effected by the encounters. ,From I95 south take the LPGA BLVD exit near Daytona  turn right  follow to end and turn right onto International Speedway BLVD (17/92)  continue on 17/92 into DeLand  Turn left onto 17  turn right onto 44 west  continue on 44 approximatly 10 miles.

1025,Me and my friend Kaiti were walking Flat Island Preserve in Leesburg Florida Lake County it was about 9 30 at night we were walking the nature trail when we heard a something hit a tree over and over we aproached the area where it was coming from and seen what i think was bigfoot it looked at us for a second and ran off it was about 8 feet. , ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12069,no
1026,As I was hiking in Ocala National Forest I noticed a suspicious-looking formation of small trees off to the right side of the trail. I have seen videos of similar structures that were attributed to Sasquatch activity and I was also well aware of the activity in that area from reports that I read before I went on the trip  so this really sparked my interest. The structure appeared to be about 8 1/2 feet tall at the point where the trees and branches connected. What surprised me the most was the fact that it was not constructed entirely of broken branches  but mostly out of trees that were broken down and still rooted. The entire structure was composed of 6 broken trees and 3 broken branches (this is not including the  base  tree). One of the details of the structure that really stood out to me was the single tree that was bent down  twisted between two trees that were still standing  and then added into the main structure. If this is some sort of Sasquatch-made landmark put there for whatever reason  I don  t know for sure  but I do know that it wouldn  t have made much of a shelter. That wouldn  t make much sense to me if it was considering it  s location and lack of practicality as a shelter. I think this is directly related to the Sasquatch activity in the area  and if it is some sort of land mark  whatever made it did a pretty good job of building it. I actually had my video camera on me at the time. I have included that video below. ,Specific Directions omitted. ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12069,yes
1027,Late at night as my family and I were setting off fireworks  we heard something growl loud enough for all of us to hear. My daughters boyfriend  a policeman said he thought it was a  bear  just in the treeline off to our left which was very close. Since we do have black bears  I picked up my grandbaby and we all stepped back as my husband and daughter  s boyfriend had a look around. Something crashed away into the woods and was gone. The crazy thing is that the sound was nothing like we had ever heard before and we  ve been here a long time. I might add that we recently completely fenced the area which makes it even more odd. Accessing the yard would be hard for a bear now. Our dogs did not bark but  we had been setting off fireworks  so  I kind of let them off the hook! This occurred again about a month later in August. I had stepped out on the back porch to get a soda from the refrigerator. I felt the hair on my neck stand up and about that time  I heard the same low growling noise straight in front of me that we had heard in July. Then  I heard rustling and what sounded like someone running into or hitting the side of our wooden shed out back very loudly. I yelled to my husband and ran out behind the shed with a spotlight. I saw nothing  and there was no noise of something running away. The woods are thick there so  someone or something would only have to stand a few feet away to disappear. The dogs finally decided to bark when I yelled at my husband  but then  they are kind of lazy and could have been sleeping. Amazingly enough  they are always manage to be awake long enough to eat. ,From Deland  FL go W on SR 44 across the St. Johns River. Take first right on CR 42.

1028,I want to start out by saying that I have never discussed this with anyone except for one other person. I have not discussed it with my wife  my best friend  or any other person close to me in my life. I was fortunate to have a coworker who had  many years ago  shared a similar personal experience that he had in Utah. He is the only person with whom I have shared my experience. I also want to say that what I am about to describe to you has tormented me for the last several months. I cannot emphasize enough how this encounter has affected me emotionally. Thanks to the encouragement of a fantastic confidant  I am now coming forward to report the incident as a step toward putting it behind me and getting on with my life. I did not ask for this  and had the event been within my control  I would have absolutely chosen not to have the experience. My life was perfectly fine with my previous view of reality  as incomplete and skewed as it may have been. I grew up in a very rural setting  and have always loved the outdoors and being in nature. I love to spend time in the beautiful wetlands and forests of Floridaâ€™s vast uninhabited wilderness areas. Monday through Friday  I work as an executive in a very large multinational corporation based in Orlando  FL  and being shut up in an office building throughout the week makes me stir-crazy. My life is a very high-stress environment  with responsibilities that include a multi-million dollar P&L  and oversight of approximately 1 000 employees. My weekends are often spent decompressing in nature through hiking or canoeing  especially in the winter months when the temperature is more comfortable. On the morning of Sunday  January 15th  I was visiting friends in Lake Mack  FL  which is a very small community located in a rural area of Central Florida about 10 miles west of Deland  FL  and about 30 miles from my home. To get to this area  go west on HW 44 out of Deland. Highway 44 will curve south just before the drawbridge that crosses the St. Johns River. The Pier 44 Marina will be on the left and is visible from the drawbridge. Immediately after crossing the drawbridge from Volusia into Lake County  turn right onto County Road 42 and continue west for about four miles. If approaching on the westbound side of the road  the Lake Mack community will be located on the south (left) side of CR 42  and the Ocala National Forest on the north (right). CR 42 traverses the southern edge of the 600 square mile Ocala National Forest. Having never been to Lake Mack prior to the 15th  I had earlier looked at the Google Maps application installed on my Blackberry to get directions. I noticed that the Ocala National Forest was just across the road  and saw that there were several forest service roads that crisscrossed the southern portion of the forest. I decided that after my visit  I would go drive through the forest and possibly do some exploring and hiking. I finished up in Lake Mack about noon and drove west on CR 42 for about 1 mile  and turned right onto Deerhaven Road and proceeded north into the forest. Deerhaven Road is paved for about the first 2 or 3 miles until it turns into National Forest Service Road 420  which to my surprise was a one-lane  very bumpy  unpaved road. Initially  I was very nervous about continuing  but the dirt-road was compacted and my car appeared to handle it with no problems. Feeling a bit more comfortable  I continued deeper into the woods. I drove for what I would estimate to be another 3 miles or so. The road passed through an area that appeared to have been burned in the past by a forest fire  as most of the pines were dead and only a very thick 3 to 5 ft layer of saw palmetto and other scrubby bushes covered the ground. In this area  the visibility was better due to the lack of a forest canopy and I could see the forest line about a mile in the distance. At this point  the road was still good  and so I continued driving until I the road left the burned zone and entered the tree line into a heavily forested area. I would estimate that after about Â½ to 1 mile into the forested area  I started to notice an increasing amount of soft sand in the road rather than the hardened more compacted dirt that I had been driving on previously. I got nervous and decided to turn around and go back out of the forest on NFS 420 the same way that I had entered. At that moment I felt the car sink into sand. I quickly steered left up on the side of the road so that I could get turned around. I was able to get the car turned around in the opposite direction  but when I moved forward about a foot  the car sank deep in the sand. I tried for some period of time to get unstuck  but ended up only digging the tires deeper into the sand. It dawned on me what a stupid idea it was to bring a car into the backcountryâ€”lesson learned. So here I was  in one of the wildest and most remote areas in the State of Florida completely stranded and all alone. I decided to try to dig out the wheels. I was down on my knees next to the front driverâ€™s side tire digging the sand with my hands. After a few minutes of this  I stood upright to stretch my back out of the hunched position I had been in. When I stood up  a rock pelted me and a shooting pain went through the inside of my left thigh near the groin area  which caused me to jump back and yelp in pain. Because I was leaning forward against the fender of the car  the rock bounced off my leg and onto the hood of the car  and then slid slowly down the hood and into the sand  which  to my relief  told me that it was not a bullet or snakebite. I immediately looked toward the forest on the other side of the road from where the rock came  and perceived movement in the bushes. At this point  I did not see the creature  but did see movement in the branches and leaves of the shrubs  grasses and saw palmetto. The movement was enough to convince me that someone or something was there  and that itâ€”whatever it wasâ€”was the source of the rock. Unsure of what to do  I stood there for about 30 seconds and checked my surroundings  including the road to the east and west  and the forest that was immediately behind me. After I turned back from looking into the trees behind me  I heard movement in the forest behind me. The sound that I heard was the sound of leaves and sticks being crushed on the ground  as if someone took one step and then stopped. The sound appeared to come from about 15 feet in the woods behind me. So now at this point  I had perceived movement in the woods on both sides of the road immediately in front of and behind me. I looked back again into the trees behind me where the noise originated  but saw nothing. At this point  the fear struck me pretty hard. Several things crossed my mind  such as wild hogs  bears and coyotes. But none of those animals obviously  to my knowledge  were capable of throwing rocks. Then the thought crossed my mind that perhaps there were a couple of people who had decided to have a little fun at my expense.  So  I called out into the forest  â€œWhoâ€™s there? This isnâ€™t funny. I need help getting my car out of the sand. Please help me â€ and so on. I heard nothing in reply and saw no movement. With the fear mounting and my thoughts turning more toward protection rather than getting my car unstuck  I remembered that I had a can of UDAP in my backpack in the trunk. The previous summer  I had hiked part of the Appalachian Trail in Tennessee and North Carolina and had purchased a couple of cans of UDAP for that trip. I walked around the back of the car  opened the trunk and pulled out my backpack. When I slammed the trunk shut  I again heard movement in the trees on the south side of the road and the location from which the rock had been thrown. I looked to my right and began unzipping the backpack when the creature started to make a hissing sound  though up to this point I still had not visually identified the animal. It was a very loud hissing sound  similar to what you might hear from a feral cat that is being cornered  only much  much louder and deeper. It then started to alternate between a hiss and a vocalization that sounded like â€œhaaaaawwwwwâ€. So the sound it was making was a protracted â€œhhhiiiiiissssssssssssssss  haaaaawwwwwww  hhhiiiiissssssssssssssss  haaaaawwwwwwww â€ with an intermittent deeper gurgling sound interspersed throughout. Hearing this put me into flight mode  and I immediately got in the car and locked the doors. When I slammed the door  I looked across the passenger seat out through the passenger side window and saw the creature about 15 feet into the woods as it got up and stood up on two legs. It was out of view previously  as I was able to later conclude  because it had been in a completely prostate position in or behind about 3 or 4 feet of saw palmetto. I saw its head rise up first  then its back  then it appeared to go to all fours  and finally pushed itself up with its long arms onto two legs. I briefly saw its side profile as it did not turn and face me directly  but rather stood up facing east in parallel to the road. Once it rose up completely on two legs  its head was obscured by the tree branches above  while at the same time  its feet and legs were obscured by the saw palmetto and other bushes below. So  at this point  I was looking at its torso through about a 3 to 4 foot clearing between the scrub below and the branches above. To say the least  I was completely petrified. I was locked in my car  but absolutely did not feel safe at all. I would estimate that the creature was about 8 feet tall. It was extremely bulky across the bust  with very muscular arms  and I have no doubt that it could have easily busted out the windows and ripped me to shreds if it so desired. It stood there for what I would estimate to be about 3 seconds. I also observed what would commonly be described as a â€œlove-handleâ€  around the side of the belly area and back. The creatureâ€™s hair was black and gray in color and was slicked down against the lighter skin  which could be seen in some places through what appeared to be wet hair. The hair was very thick on the arms and shoulders but less so around the side belly and back areas. It appeared to be wet because the hair was slicked down against the skin. After standing there for approximately three seconds  it hunched forward and walked east in parallel to the road and was immediately out of sight in the trees. Just before the first step  when the creature hunched forward  it put its hands forward to grab onto some branches  which allowed me to get a glimpse of its right hand. From what I could see  the top of the hand and arm was very hairy. It had about 3 inches of hair hanging down from the wrist area that was longer than the rest of the hair on its arm. One thing that stood out to me: when the arm swung up  I noticed the palm area was much lighter than the rest of the arm  almost a light grey or even off-white color  which was in stark contrast to the much darker hair that covered the other areas of the arm  torso and back. As it swam through the bushes  I could see the trees move and shake as it moved forward through the woods along the side of the road. It walked through the scrub for what I would estimate to be about 15 or 20 feet  and then stopped  again completely obscured from my view. Also  the hissing and other vocalization had stopped at this point and everything was completely quiet. After about a minute had passed of no further movement  I saw a tiny dark portion of the creature peek out from behind a pine tree that was growing near the side of the road about 15 or 20 feet in front of me. I could not perceive any detail at this point whatsoever  just that it was hiding and peaking from behind the tree. It appeared to be crouching down because the peek appeared about 3 or maybe 4 feet up the side of the pine tree from the base of the tree on the ground. It was obvious to me that the creature had previously responded to the slamming of the car door and trunk. Not knowing what else to do  I laid down on the horn and started opening and slamming shut the driverâ€™s side door hoping that such nuisance noises would drive it out of the area. It did in fact evoke a response  but not the one I was hoping for. After about 15 seconds of door-slamming and horn-honking  the creature lumbered slowly on all fours in sort of a crouched position from behind the tree onto the side of the road right along the tree line. I quickly slammed the door shut. As soon as the door slammed  the creature reared back and flung a soft-ball sized amount of slimy brown  lumpy material that was about the consistency and color of â€œwetâ€ peanut butter all over the hood of the car. It slid down the hood and onto the sand in front of the car  leaving a wet residue on the hood. It then put its arms forward  moving out of the crouched position  and then quickly crossed the road in front of me using both its arms and legs to walk on all fours  just like a four-legged animal. It looked back at me briefly and then disappeared into the tree line on the opposite side of the road. One thing I noticed at this point is that the creature was completely soaking wet from head to toe. When it flung the material at the car  I saw water drops shake off of the arm. It was very wet with the hair laying slicked to the skin  much like what you might see with a wet  long-haired dog. The face of the creature was a dark grey color  with very large dark eyes. It had a very large mouth with extremely large  fat lips. The nose was human-like  with one exception  which was large  slightly flared nostrils. The nose did not protrude off its face in proportion to a humanâ€™s  but was flatter and more sunken. The creature looked like an ape  but with facial featuresâ€”especially the nasal areaâ€”that were very similar to those of humans. I resumed honking the horn  but did not open the door because I did not have eye contact with it and further knew that it was now in the forest on the same side of the road where I was sitting in the driverâ€™s seat. I did not want to give it the advantage of an open door should it decide to jump out of the woods to my immediate left and attack the car. About 1 minute after disappearing into the tree line  the creature reemerged  this time walking completely upright on two legs  just like a human. It paused at the tree line for a second  and then took one huge step back across the road. The creature  to my shock and horror  was carrying along a â€œchildâ€ of the same creature. It had both arms of the smaller creature grasped in its right hand  and was dangling the juvenile along by its side  with the legs of the smaller creature almost touching the ground. The smaller creature appeared to be completely limp from the neck down  but its eyes were open and it was moving its head and looking toward the trees to which it was being carried. After crossing the road  the creature paused at the tree line on the opposite side of the road  lifted the juvenile up onto its hip  and continued into the scrub. Just before disappearing  the small creature wrapped its legs around the back and stomach and clung to the creatureâ€™s chest with its arms. Basically  it was carrying the smaller creature in the same way that a human would carry a child on the hip. It did not reemerge from that point forward  nor did I see any sign or hint of it again. I would estimate that the smaller creature was about three feet tall. It was also a different color than the adult  with the child being more of a light brown  with possibly some hints of a red and blonde  versus the black and grey color of the adult. One thing that stood out about the child is that it appeared to be very  very thin  almost to the point of appearing emaciated. I could actually see the outline of the ribs through the skin and hair that covered it. I sat petrified in my car for about an hour until I looked up and saw two hunters driving Jeeps down the road toward me. They were kind enough to pull my car out of the sand  and quickly got me going on my way out of the forest. Once I got on HWY 44  I left the area at about 85 mph and never looked back. I was in a state of complete shock over what I had experienced. Prior to this experience  I was not a Bigfoot believer. Og how wrong I was. ,from Lake Mack go west on CR42  to Deer Haven Rd  go right on Deer Haven Rd till it turns into FSR420(about 4 miles from when you first turn onto Deer Haven and you will be near the spot in the road. ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12069,yes
1029,The date was Fri.  Aug. 15th  2014. I had arrived on Amtrak from Kissimmee to Deland an hour late which made it 3 40 pm. I waited ten minutes for my luggage  then left the station to take CR42 West to Lady Lake. It was between 4 and 4 30 pm while I was driving that I noticed something running on someone  s farm land. There were cows gathered in a pasture near the house. The creature was running in their direction but at a long even stride. I was probably about 150 yds away on the highway. It was brown/black in color and was the same all over. The stride was long  maybe about 3 1/2 to 4 ft. between steps. The creature looked at least 6   ft tall. It was the first thing I thought of as it was on two legs and all the other animals were on four. It looked out of place. No one else was around as far as I could see. The creature was running along the fence line. Which should be mentioned is that CR42 runs the southern edge of the Ocala National Forest where sightings have been seen. On Sept. 4th I had to pick up tickets in Deland for a trip. I took the same road but passed the farm because of traffic behind me. I wanted to photograph the area but couldn  t. ,I was going west of 42 after coming off Hwy 44 over the St. John  s River Bridge. ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12069,yes
1030,I was in my car going south on ___ towards ________ to run errands on a bright sunny Saturday morning. I came around the last curve of the road where it straightens out towards ________. I looked down at the temperature on my car and it said 86 and I saw a blue SUV coming towards me in the other lane. I thought nothing of the SUV until this tall creature stepped onto the road and in two steps had crossed the lane I was driving in and was into the left lane and my view of it was then obstructed. It was completely covered in thick hair  all the way to the pavement. I couldn  t see any feet and it was about 1/8 mile away so I didn  t see any facial features. The head did not bob up and down as it walked. It just went straight across the road. I have never seen anything move so quickly. I  ve seen lots of animals cross the road in that general vicinity because there are not many houses or much development  and I have NEVER seen that. I did not believe in Bigfoot and teased my husband because he believed. I will never doubt another sighting report. The hair of the chest was slightly orange in the bright sunshine. It moved so fast I was unable to see it  s face but I saw the right arm swing back and the left arm swing back and then it stepped out of view. I kept driving towards it and the SUV and I thought I might flag that SUV down and ask if they saw it but when it got close to me  but decided not to. The hair kind of stood up above the head. I would say it had a sort of flat forehead and kind of a pointy head. The hair seemed to be standing above it  s head but there wasn  t any wind. I would be happy to show some BFRO person exactly where this happened and explain it to them if someone wants to contact me or come here for a visit. ,Omitted due to ongoing investigation. ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12069,yes

1032,I was a child in Fort Myers Fla.  approximately 1973 or 74. We lived in a trailer court  Twin Lakes Estates. All around the perimeter of the trailer court was a canal and beyond the canal was wooded areas. In one area  we had a play ground. The play ground was separated from the woods by a dry canal. We would wonder through the woods and play war around the scrub palms. One evening it was just getting dusk  we had finished playing in the woods and were hanging around the playground. When one of the other kids said he saw something moving in the woods. We all climbed the ladder to the slide  to see further into the woods. I could just make out a shape  it was large  grey or brown covered in hair. It was moving slowly through the scrub palms we had been playing in  moving away from us. We  being just kids  freaked out and ran home to tell our parents. Only to be shushed and told it was our imaginations. ,The name of the trailer court was Twin Lakes Estates. It was just off US Hwy. 41 and there was a place called  The Shell Factory  a tourist attraction nearby. ,Lee,19,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12071,yes
1033,I will tell you about an experience that I and a friend of mine had back around 1982 or 1983 mid summer time in Lee County  Florida. I have lived in Florida since I was 9 years old. I am 44 now. I have roamed all over the woods down here and so has my friend Bill. We are both well acquainted with the noises that the native animals make  what we heard that night while camping was not anything that either of us had ever heard before. I am not in a hurry to ever hear again. The location of the vocalization was approximatley 15 to 20 miles from I-75 going east on SR 82. I lived off of Shawnee trail back then and hiked the cypress swamps every chance I got. I knew the area well back then having hunted deer and hog all over that area. I still live in unincorporated Lee county near the Hendry county line. Bill and I had gone camping on a weekend during the wet season. We had to wade quite a bit of wet area to find a suitable dry place to set up camp. I lived about 1 and 1/2 miles off of S.R.82 and where we were camping then was probably another 3 or 4 miles back in the swamp. We had just gotten a fire going and it was quite dark by now. We were sitting by the fire when we both heard a deep scream coming from out of the swamps. It was like no sound I have ever heard. It was deep and drawn out and echoed back through the swamps. I am not exagerating when I tell you that even the bugs got quiet. Bill looked at me and said   What the hell was that?   I said  I dont know but I  m going home.   We broke camp and left. Neither of us was carrying a weapon during that trip. I dont think I would have shot what ever it was that made that noise  but I don  t ever go to the woods now without a gun. I can also provide you with Bill  s contact info so you can ask him about it. We did not see anything nor smell anything just heard the one scream. I would estimate the creature was within 1 mile or less of us.  I have told my parents about this. They said it may have been a gator or panther but I know what those animals sound like. It was neither of those animals.  I know several other people that have had experiences with the skunk ape. I am not sure if they will be willing to talk about their experiences or not. ,Head east on S.R.82 out of Ft.Myers FL go to shawnee trail aprox 15 miles from Ft. Myers  go south on shawnee trail till it dead ends ( it did back then I have not been out there in many years.)then back into the cypress swamp about 3 to 4 miles pretty much south south west. Its mostly pine and scrub with cypress swamp and some oak hammock high spots. ,Lee,19,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12071,no
1034,I have just happened upon your web site and I am amazed at all the encounters in Florida.  I just finished reading one from the Lee County area that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I grew up in Lee County and had two unexplainable (until now) experiences that I have never forgotten. The first  that after reading one of your articles  I now feel very strongly that I was being followed by a  Bigfoot.   I lived on about 100 acres that butted up to Cecil Webb (a Game Reserve of apprx. 15 000 acres  in Charlotte County  FL.) A friend and I were taking a nighttime horseback ride down the dirt road that I lived off of.  There where large ditches on both sides of the road  with woods and cattle pastures  all up and down this road  which was probably about 10 miles long. She and I were talking about what 15 year old girls talk about  when our horses started acting spooked and getting very nervous.  Shortly thereafter  I noticed that something was walking along side of us in the woods on the other side of the ditch.  I could only hear it because there was not quite half a moon and it was a cloudy night.  I knew that there was a cattle pasture there and at first dismissed it as maybe being a cow  which would have odd seeings that cattle usually run in the other direction when seeing a person on horseback  but it was possible.  But the pattern in which it moved didn  t sound like a cow  the area was pretty thick with trees  palmettos and such and whatever it was had no problem staying right with us and we were on open land.  We weren  t really scared yet  but we picked up our horse  s pace a little and began to gallop  I knew there was a cross section coming up in the fence and figured whatever it was would be stopped there.  My girlfriend and I had our horses in a pretty good gallop at this point  but we were extermely shaken after passing the cross-section of fence and it was still there.  It seemed as though it never missed a stride.  At this point we both let out screams and were now at a full run  crossing several more fence lines  only to have it stay right with us.  It only stopped when we reached the edge of my property and it was no longer wooded.  By the time my parents calmed down two screaming  crying  freaked out teenage girls  we went out in the truck and saw where something had been  but never saw what it was.  Needless to say  that was the last time I  ve ever been nighttime horseback riding.  ,North on Highway 31 to what used to be Cook and Brown Road. ,Lee,19,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12071,yes
1035,In 1963 I was nine years old and living in North Fort Myers  Lee County  Florida. In the weeks before this happened to me  there were several sightings of bigfoot reported in the newspaper. One of the sightings had taken place in a wooded area not far from where I lived. Our house was on the corner of Estate Drive and another street I can  t remember  near a canal.  We lived a block away from U.S. 41. On the corner was a street light that usually lit up my bedroom  which I shared with my younger sister and my grandmother. It was around 10pm  and I was in bed  trying to go to sleep. I was startled by some heavy footsteps outside on the grass and as I turned to the window I saw a huge shadow pass by as I continued hearing the footsteps. Whatever it was walked right past my window with a human-like walk. I couldn  t make out what it was but it was not any four-legged animal  such as a cow.  This thing walked on two feet and was taller than a man. Then I heard a low pitched but quite loud moan that just scared the heck out of me.  I was not asleep (as my parents later asked) because I sat up straight in bed and seeing that my sister and my grandma were sound asleep  I ran out of my room and jumped into bed with my mother and father sobbing and shaking. I know that I heard and saw bigfoot  s shadow.  I had never before  nor never after had an experience like that one.  I will never forget it. At school  when I mentioned what had happened  several kids had stories of sightings  but of course  kids will make up stuff like that. ,I don  t have directions to that area but I did a search and found Estate Drive in North Fort Myers  so it  s not difficult to find. ,Lee,19,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12071,yes
1036,I was helping my mother-inlaw with the begining stages of preparing her 8 acre property so that she could build a house on it. The area is mostly covered in Oak trees  Cabbage Palms  Scrub Oaks  Mullberry trees  and Brazian Pepper trees With wild Grape vines hanging out of the trees to the ground.The majority of the acreage is flat ground covered with Oaks there is a state drainage ditch that runs close to the East side of plot  that is where I was working near the road. on the other side of the ditch there is an extremely low swampy area near the North side of the land along the road in the wet season (May to October)I have seen small fish  turtles  and gators in this area. My wife  s cousin lives in a in a house in the ajacent property with Oaks covering a good bit of it but cleared under the trees. On a previous Previous trip out to my mother-inlaws land I in stalled a tempory gate in the barbed wire fence. This time out I hired a friend  s 15 year old son  to help haul branches that I was cutting back to a clearing In the middle of the property to be burned at a later date. I cleared and he hauled for a few hours  after a while I noticed that he was getting tired and it was starting to get later in the day. around 5 00-5 30 PM so decided to stop clearing and help him carry the branches back. For a good bit of the time the cousins dog follow him back and forth as he hauled the branches. Anyway as we were walk back we came to a spot where the fence was pulled back between the two parcels and the dog came through the gap in the fence  at the moment coming out of what would be the back of the low swampy area was three whoops. The first one was long and drawn out the two that followed were short. A chill ran down my spine as my mind was trying to place a animal to the sound. It was too loud and too deep to have come from an owl. What ever it came from it came from a large chest. At this point I did think Bigfoot and looked down at the dog but she was calm and seemed happy. I then looked back at the area that the whoops came from and there was a squirrel sitting on a downed palm flicking its tail. This made me dismiss the Bigfoot idea. I immediately asked the boy if he had heard that. The thing is theres no way anyone could have missed it  it was so loud. then he said he heard it on one of his previous trips back. For days I racked my brain for what could have been I have been hiking in the woods and swamps of Florida all my life and know the sounds of the local wild life and couldn  t come up with anything that fits the bill. It did sound alot like the Howler Monkeys I  ve heard in zoos  but the tone was way too deep to be a Howler Monkey. About a week later I was out with a cotractor to talk about putting in a drive back to where the house is to bee built. He also has been in Florida a long time  so told him of the noise I heard and asked him if he could tink of any animal that could have made that sound and he said a Whooping Crain. I said oh! yah that must be it. I went home satisfied with that answer. About week later I was poking around the internet and I looked up info on Whooping Crains and there was recordings on the site I found. When I played the track a chill ran through me not because it was the sound I heard but because it wasn  t. I thought about sending a report in for months now  but because of being so unsure of what I heard I held back. Well today I was at my daughters babyshower and the cousin was there for some reason my 12 year old decided that it was a good time to blurt out I saw a Bigfoot  correcting him I said I heard a noise  and of course he said that I heard a Bigfoot I again corrected him and said that I didn  t know what it was and elaberated that it was out on the property. At this point the cousin became very interested and asked what it sounded like  so I imitated whoops for her at that she said that she had been hearing strange sounds out there too. I asked if they were whooping and she said yes but there was other sounds to it also she said screaming and whooping I ask if it sounded like a woman screaming and she said kind of but not exactly. She ended it with there is some thing out there. ,It  s about 15 miles East of I-75 right off of SR. 80 e-mail for more info. ,Lee,19,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12071,yes
1037,It was on September 14th 2009  I had a face to face encounter with a Skunk Ape in Fort Myers  Florida. It was about 2-2 30 am I was out in my back yard fishing from a pier in my back yard. I had just moved to Florida on the 1st of Sept. 2009. Honestly I had never heard of a Skunk Ape in my life  squatches and bigfoots yes I had  but being from New Mexico I had never heard of a Skunk Ape. Anyway I was outside fishing and I had caught a couple of snappers and had them there next to me in a bucket  I was dozing off when I heard a noise behind me about 30 feet away in a small canal directly behind me  I was lying down in a lawn cot and not in view of the Skunk Ape. I didn  t pay it too much attention thinking it was a Raccoon which I had seen earlier. I heard the noise in the swamp again only louder and closer so I stood up to see what it was. I saw a large figure standing behind about a 5 - 6 ft. palm tree. I couldn  t make out what it was so I walked up closer when I saw him turn towards me face to face and only about 15 feet away. I believe I scared or surprised the Ape about as much as he did me  he began to move from side to side and up and down as if mad or frightened. He definitely had an ape-like face and hairy body. Hard to tell the exact color because it was dark except for the light outside on the house  but it did appear to be a darkish brown color  I am guessing over six foot tall because he stood over the Palm tree about a head length. Directly in line with this small ditch or canal are the Railroad tracks leading across the Caloosahatchee River and back into the wilderness and forest or swamps. As I ran into the house to call my wife and son  he also retreated back towards the Railroad tracks and was gone. The house I moved into is in a very Secluded area of Ft. Myers  Florida in a lagoon and wild bird sanctuary. , ,Lee,19,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12071,yes

1039,My brother and I were standing in some dense under brush at the edge of a very marshy area while we were trailblazing and we heard a howl  but it was a very deep and very loud it echoed in the trees and kind of scared us at first but it seemed a little ways off so we sat and listened. Then the sound changed and was exactly the same sound as the recording that Matt Moneymaker made in Ohio Valley called Bigfoot Scream which is actually what prompted me to write this. We listened to it for about a half hour and could swear we heard an answer but it was faint. ,Off Hwy 19 between Crystal River and Yankee Town is a small one-light town called Inglis.

1040,I was 18 years old  living in Chiefland  Florida. I just graduated from high school (1981)  class valedictorian  and  had begun my freshman year at the University of Florida in Gainesville. It was around 7 30 am with a fair amount of light. Fall was just rolling in and the air was beginning to cool. It was a clear morning at the end of August and I was on my way to my first class  The drive from my parentâ€™s home to school took me through heavily wooded  sparsely populated areas of north central Florida. I was on highway 27 between Bronson and Chiefland  coming around a big bend in the road.  The trees had been clear cut from the edge of the road for about 100 yards on either side. As I followed the curve  a movement on my left caught my eye. Someone was walking out of the tree line and towards the road. I slowed and pulled over  finally stopping my car as I tried to frame what I was seeing in terms I could understand  The â€œpersonâ€ walking from the woods was huge  well over 7 feet tall. I kept wondering what a tall  naked  hairy â€œmanâ€ was doing out in the woods at that time (or any time) of the day. I never had the thought â€œskunk apeâ€ or â€œBigfootâ€â€¦I truly wanted to find a rational explanation for the creature that crossed the road (in just a couple of steps) and continued  unhurried  towards the line of trees on the other side. As I sat in my car staring at the creature  it turned to look at me  moving the upper torso to do so. I felt like we regarded each other for quite some time and  as stunned as I was  I was not prepared for what happened next. The creature reached down and swung a â€œjuvenileâ€ up onto her hip and disappeared into the trees  clearing a small barbed wire fence in one step. I do not know how long I sat there  trying to sort it out. I know I was late for class  and I never told anyone  until recently. I have never been able to say that what I saw was a Sasquatch  Bigfoot or Skunk Ape (the most common term in my area). I just know I witnessed something remarkable. And  I have never been able to shake it. Imagine my surprise when I saw a post on your site that was nearly identical to mine  in the same area  same circumstances  but years apart. I am a well-educated woman  a professional and like a logical explanation to seemingly unexplainable things. This is not a story I tell my friends or family. But it is one that plays itself repeatedly in my mind  And when I hear people scoff at the notion of a giant  hairy  bipedal animal roaming the rural parts of the country  I keep quiet and I feel a little sorry for them. To believe in only what you have seen yourself seems a poorer existence. I cannot name my experience on the road that day  but I am fortunate  in a way  to have witnessed something truly remarkable. ,there are no main arteries (interstates) running though Chiefland or the surrounding small burgs.

1041,My family found a track of footprints on our hunting property. We were able to follow it for over a mile. We casted two prints (a right & left.)  We followed the track and found a place where it had gone through a barb wire fence  taking out 5 or 6 posts  and what appeared to be a place where it slept. We even found swamp cabbage that was eaten and appeared to be discarded. ,7 - 10 miles north of Yankee Town ,Levy,11,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12075,yes
1042,I saw a bigfoot while driving between Bronson and Williston on 27 east  in June of 1991. It was about 4 00 in the afternoon  it was a clear and sunny day. The bigfoot ran about 100 yards across the road in abount 20 seconds. It was about 70 yards ahead of us  it appeared to be carrying a small bigfoot child in its arms it appeared to be about 8 feet tall and completely covered in hair. ,Between Bronson and Willison FL ,Levy,11,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12075,yes

1044,One day in the fall of 2000  while hunting  I was standing on the dirt road that surrounded the wooded hunting area.  We were all spaced a few yards apart and out of each others line of sight and shooting lane.  As I was listening for the dogs and looking up and down the wood line  hopefully for my shot at the deer  I caught something out of the corner of my eye on my left side. The road that I was on was just wide enough to fit two full-size trucks passing each other  and the swamp monkey  that  s what we all called the supposedly made up animal that lived in this area  crossed the road in two strides.  It looked like it could have been about 6 Â½ - 7   tall. We had one gentleman that hunted there with us that was just under 7   and I would say it was about the same height as him from a distance.  It had such a thick build with gray hair or fur covering all of its body.  A somewhat fluid stride for its massive size. Not knowing what I actually saw and wondering if maybe it was hunters from another camp  I turned around and started to walk to the person that was closest to me in the other direction  hoping that they had a truck that I could ride back to camp with them in  being the only female and not knowing exactly who or what it was that I saw  I thought it best to go find someone else from the camp at that moment to be around. The day was a nice cool  bright fall day  approximately 11 00 am.  That night at camp over dinner I had told the others  what I had seen and they all said that I saw my first swamp monkey. The next day I didn  t venture too far out of camp to hunt by myself  because what ever it was had crossed from another camp into our hunting area.  After a while I did get the nerve up to get a little pellet gun and walk down the road to look for squirrels.  I made it down about 50 yards down the road and started to notice that there were no sounds from the woods. No birds  no squirrels  nothing.  Then I heard something just inside the wood line breathing and grunting  growling   thinking it may be a wolf or bear I turned around and started to walk back to camp.  What ever was next to me did the same.  I started to walk faster then jog  the animal in the woods did the same.  Laughing to myself I stopped to catch my breath  so did the noise in the woods.. no more footsteps but more harsh breathing.  I couldn  t see any shapes or movement but decided to run the rest of the way back to camp and did not look back.  That was the last time that I had any such encounter of that kind. ,Private Hunting Grounds....

1045,About three years ago me and a buddy of mine went scouting in the Goathee State forest off of highway 336/337 like we do almost every other day. Seeing that his house line was aganist the forest. That morning we decided to go further back than usuall  to try and find new deer trails or run up on a family of hogs. We were about three miles back and we started smelling something that I can only explain as being a dead carcuss mixed with a skunk. We have always been interested in Bigfoot  so I knew that it stinks but didnt think it was in central florida. Although there has been sightings in the ocala national forest. We keeped walking and came up on an old logging or ranger trail  it was covered with overgrown grass and had branches all over it. The road had palmettos lining it with a creek or runoff ditch on one side. We started walking down the trail towards our house. We were still about 2 3/4 mile from 337 when we came up on a bend in the trail. We walked around slowly to try and see deer or maybe some hogs on the trail  knowing that there are a couple herds in the area. There was nothing so we keeped walking. I told my friend to stop walking because I thought I saw something standing about 150yds down. I pointed at what I saw and we couldnt figure it out. He told me it was probably a tree  seeing that the had spray painted the trees to get them cut down. We keep walking and then it moved quite quickly toward the side of the trail  by then I was really nervous. We watched it from about 100yds away. It stayed on the left side of the trail neeling in some palmettos just staring at us. After about 10 minutes we were able to slowly get down in the creek out of the road but makeing sure it was still visible. After about 15 minutes of us staring at it  not believing that we actually are seeing a bigfoot it got up and walked back across the trail being followed by a smaller less intimidating one. The smaller one was not as dark as the bigger and had more of a redish color to it. they went out of sight when they crossed the creek into a densely cover underbrush. We found two footprints but no other signs of them. The bigger one was a dark brown with a hint of red in the sunlight. With lighter chest. Not really any hair on his face. We mesure the hight of them by what they walked by and the larger one was around 7 1/2-9 foot tall and the smaller was around 6-7 foot tall. I took my shoe off and put my foot in the print  I wear a size 11 1/2 shoe and the print was larger than my foot. ,Take SR 19 to 336 then 336 to 337 off of 337 in the woods.

1046,I never got a visual. I was hog hunting/scouting an area with fresh activity. The first thing I noticed were some unusual scrapings on some tree  s  higher up than any animal found here. Really paid little to no attention to that until after the fact. I went further into a game trail and I heard a noise as if someone  or something was flanking me. It moved when I moved. As it grew darker I changed my direction and then began hearing a screech/growl that I was unfamilar with. Raised the hairs on my neck and I got out of there. I went home and told my wife and we laughed it off. I studied the satellite imagery for the area and chose a close by location for the following day. The following day I enetered thick brush on a game trail working my way back to a dried up lake with a clearing. The brush on either side of me was so thick you couldn  t enter if you wanted. I heard  again  something walking with me  and another audible screech/growl  followed by what sounded like a large stick hitting a tree several times. I exited the area fastly. I went to another area 1/2 mile away and walked a horse trail. I experienced the same audible noise and then the tree hitting again. As I approached I felt the ground as it seemed as tho something were stomping or pounding it just off the trails edge. Then a rock was thrown in my direction followed by that screech/growl and then I could hear all hell break loose into the woods. As I was exiting the trail I came across a HUGE track that I took pictures of in comparison to my size 14 shoe it was nearly twice as long and wide. There were no prints in the footprint  like what my shoe left behind. I could make out the heel ball and toes. I am a skeptic myself  but I  ll be damned if I can explain this  and I know I will NOT be going back to that area alone. ,Black Prong trails Goethe State Forest ,Levy,11,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12075,no
1047,A friend and I were driving east on Hwy 27 between Chiefland and Bronson. Hwy 27 is a four lane road. The lanes are separated by a wide grass median  maybe 50 feet wide that serves as a drainage feature for the highway. It was September 29  2012. The time was about 8 pm and it was dark and raining a little. The sighting occurred about a quarter mile east of the junction of 339 and 27. My truck has loose steering and it drifted a little almost going into the grass median. A large creature jumped up from a squatlike stance like it was startled and raised its arms over its head. It ran on two legs to the north across the highway. The creature was brownish/reddish color and very muscular. It was between 7 and 8 feet tall. We could only see the back of the creature because it ran away from us and we were past it in an instant. We turned around but it was already gone. We heard no noise or sound from the creature. ,From I 75 exit at SR 27 exit. Proceed to the west thru Williston  thru Bronson  to junction of 339 ,Levy,11,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12075,yes
1048,On Saturday April 13 at 1 30 am a friend and I were driving south on Hwy 19 in Levy county FL we saw something at the woods line which almost instantly was in the road by center line. I thought we were gonna hit it. It appeared to be brown  about 8-9 ft tall and no face. Its arms appeared to b reached out as if to hit the car . In shock as to what we had just seen my friend hit the brakes. I then told him to keep going as I did not want to turn back not knowing what had just happened. Could bring harm to us or worse . We were about 4-5 miles north of otter creek . In between Chiefland and Otter Creek . This figure or creature appeared to be human shaped.

Also it was incredible how fast this creature was able to get from woods line to center of road. It had to be at least 30 yds.

1049,September 11  2016 at approximately 11 20AM My sister and I were traveling on CR 347 north of Cedar Key  a little north of SW 61st St.  We were coming out of curve when we both saw something in the road ahead.  It was  a large creature  approximately 7 1/2  8 feet tall covered with grayish black hair walking across the highway.  It turned to look at us then quickly disappeared into the woods.  There were no other cars around or houses nearby and the area was very wooded and swampy.  If this was a hoax it was a great one!

1051,I would like to speak with a researcher or investigator preferably in the north Florida or south Georgia area about incidents that have been occurring on the property I live on for the last few years. I haven  t seen anything but I  ve heard yells and growls that have made my neck hair stand up in the past. For 4 years I  ve worked nights but now I work days so I  m home every night so I  m noticing alot more now. Just about every night I  ve heard growls or stomping and have heard what sounds like imitated bird calls and also unusual smells. Just recently I found a tow strap with knots in it with a bundled up red ribbon material laying with the strap on a tree stump in my yard. The property is 68 acres of woods and pasture.

1053,We were driving up 73rd Ave E  in Myakka City  Florida. The road has been used infrequently due to the recent storms. As we were passing East at Long Creek I looked to the left and saw what looked like a pile of dark Spanish moss looking grass. I thought to myself that it was odd to see a large pile of soggy grass and moss that was oddly shaped so symmetrically. Then I saw that it was a creature standing  trying not to be seen and as still as can be. I couldnâ€™t speak  I couldnâ€™t process what I was seeing and then the words left my mouth... â€œHoneyâ€ I said to my husband  â€œI just saw a Sasquatch by the side of the road crouching downâ€. He could tell by the look on my face that I had  in fact  seen something. I still canâ€™t believe it  Iâ€™m chuckling nervously talking about it... unbelievable. It was a dark mound of crouched flesh and soggy hair. I could not see itâ€™s face just the pointed head and massive shoulders. The fence is 4.5â€™ tall and it was another 3â€™ higher and just as wide.

1054,Newspaper article  Evening Telegram  (Superior  Wisconsin)  November 15  1977 CREATURE SIGHTED OCALA  Fla. (UPI) - A 67-year-old Baptist minister who says he hasn  t had a drink in 40 years tells how he stood eyeball-to-eyeball for 30 seconds with a great  hairy creature in the Ocala National Forest. The Rev. S. L. Whatley  pastor of the Fort McCoy Baptist Church  said he spotted the thing out of the corner of his eye while he was cutting wood with a chain saw three weeks ago. Whatley recalled Monday.  It was standing upright  in the middle of some palmetto bushes  and that sapsucker was at least 7 1/2  maybe 8 feet tall. The minister said the creature  had dark  lighter-than-black hair on its head and chest  not much on its arms  and none on its face. It had kind of a flat face  a flat nose  its eyes were sunk in its sockets.  Whatley said he quickly went back to his truck to get an ax because  me and that creature was going to mix it up   but by the time he returned from the truck the creature had disappeared. He hastened to add that he hasn  t had a drink in 40 years. , ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12083,yes
1055,This incedent occurred when a DeMolay group I was a member of stayed overnight near Dunellon  Fla during my senior year in High School.  We were staying on a house on a dirt road belonging to one of the DeMolay brothers   parents.  My friend Ron and I were interested in photography  and we wanted to take some time exposure photos of stars away from city lights.  Somewhere around 10 00 or 100 00 pm. Ron  another friend Rick and I went down the dirt road until we were away from the 4 or 5 houses on the road  and took some time exposures on my tripod.  I noticed a light from a nearby house was still visible  so I moved about 30-50   further down the road; Ron and Rick stayed put.  As I put up the tripod  I noticed a foul stench coming from the woods nearby  on the opposite side of the road from the houses.  I asked Ron & Rick if they smelled anything  and they laughed  thinking I was playing a   skunk ape   joke on them.  I said I was serious  so they moved towards me.  One said he smelled it  and then Ron said   I don  t hear any crickets chriping.    I then became aware of the unusual silence.  Ron & Rich immediately turned and ran to the house; I grabbed my tripod & camera and followed.  We go to the house  and before going in agreed to not tell anyone  so they would not make fun of us.  The next morning  B4 breakfast  the 3 of us returned to the area.  We found the exact spot from where the trees blocked the house where the light I had moved to block came from  and there was no smell.  I pointed to an area where I thought the odour had originated  but we could see nothing from the road due to thick underbrush and small trees.  We walked up the road  found a way into the underbrush  and came back to the site.  Rick had stayed on the road to orient us back to the correct area  and when we found him throught the trees  the area directly where I had pointed to as the origin of the smell had a large [@4   x 5x] area of matted -down underbrush.  There was a hill going away from the road  and a small area for runoff between the road and the hill that was damp  and in that damp area  we found a large footprint @1  deep and as I recall about 16-18  long.  Ron  an offensive lineman weighing @275 lbs. barely left an impression next to it  so we knew what had left it was very heavy.  I had B&W film in my camera  left over from the stars shoot  and took a few photos of the footprint.  We planned to return after breakfast with colour film  but the group left B4 we were able to do that  and we had no choice but to leave with them. ,I wish I could recall more. ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12083,yes
1056,It was the summer of 1993  and I was five years old. I know my age at the time seems discouraging  but I know what I saw  and I can recap the whole thing like it had happened yesterday. It was a late evening and my family and I were playing around in the living room of our single wide. I went down the hallway to the back bedroom. That was my bedroom at the time and my brother and I kept our toys in there. We had one smaller window and beneath that is where we kept our toy chest  and in front of it was a chair. I went into the room  sat on my legs in the chair and opened the toy chest. I grabbed all kinds of legos  and after I had grabbed the last lego that I could have possibly held  I sat up straight and there in the window were two piercing red eyes. I just stared at them. My arms let go of the legos and they dropped back into the chest. I stared at those eyes for minute and than ran down the hallway. I had no idea what it could have been. I yelled over and over again that there was a wolf in my window. But my parents just assured me that it was probably the dog next door. Okay  we lived in a mobile home meaning it was on blocks  and no dog  even on their hind legs could peek into the window. That window was set high off the ground. And it wasn  t like it was eyes looking from below. These eyes were in the middle of the window  so whatever it was had to have been tall enough to be able to look in. They were like human eyes but not quite. For years I tried to figure out what it might be. I thought maybe an owl..but they have yellow eyes  and there were no trees close enough for a bird or animal to perch on and be that close to the window. I mean  it was right up against the window. It still gives me goosebumps to this day. And this is the same exact story I have been telling since that night for years now. And I can  t get it out of my head. ,Located in the Florida Highlands off of State Road 200. ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12083,yes
1057,In the summer of 1994  my husband  daughter and I went camping in Ocala National Forest. I love to be out in nature  but frankly  I  m a little freaked out at night. But  nonetheless  I tough it out. Despite my nighttime reservations  I told my husband I wanted a primitive campsite  away from any other campers. We found a gorgeous spot in a primitive camping area that was surrounded by high brush nearly all the way around three sides; the back side faced the woods. We chose this particular site in case other campers moved in. This spot was secluded and private from the adjacent campsites. I have always been an extremely light sleeper  especially when it  s night and there are flexible walls between me and the outdoors. I would love to sleep under the stars  but I  m much too chicken. We had brought sodas with us on the trip and were putting the empty cans in a plastic bag that we left laying next to the picnic table. The first night we were there  I was just dozing off when it sounded like something hit the bag of cans pretty hard. I was  immediately  awake shaking my husband  who can sleep through an explosion  and asking him to get up and check it out. He refused and went back to sleep. To the best of my knowledge  this is when I must have become aware of the screams far off in the distance and to the north. I lay there  awake  for the longest time listening to these screams  trying to figure out what they were. I don  t know why  but it seemed to me that they must have been about a mile away. They sounded like whomever or whatever they were  was very upset. I lay there for what seemed like hours listening to these screams. They were almost continuous. I told my husband the next day that it sounded like the (extinct) Timucuan Indians were having a war party and were screaming most of the night. I figured their spirits were reenacting a battle or something. It might not have been going on for as long as it seemed  though; when something is disturbing your sleep in the middle of the night  it can seem like forever. Indians fighting was the closest sound I could equate it with  until this evening when I listened to the newest  March 5  recording from the couple camping in Washington. Now  I have heard the Puyallup and Snohomish recordings many times  but never put it together with what I heard that night. The reason is  these earlier recordings are of a single scream  but just as the March recording clip ends  there is a scream which sounds like it is immediately answered by another scream. These 2 screams on top of one another  instantly  clicked in my head. Hearing these screams together were  EXACTLY  like the screams I heard that night. I was never frightened nor did I feel threatened by them. They were too far off  and besides  I never knew a Bigfoot type creature existed in central Florida  at that time. I thought they were exclusive to the Everglades. Only recently  have I found out that they have existed all over Florida. Even though they were far away  they were very distinct to me; as I recall the night was very silent and still. The one thing that helps to calm me at night are the familiar night sounds  but these were absent on this night. By the time I drifted off to sleep the screams were dying down  as well  but had not  completely  stopped. The first thing I did the next morning was listen for the sounds  but they were gone. I thought I might have been imagining them  but hearing this latest recording confirms to me that  maybe  I wasnâ€™t. However  your website infers that this type of scream/howl seems to be limited to the Pacific Northwest. But I can tell you  I heard these same screams right here in the largest nature preserve in Florida. When you hear something like that  you never forget it  and I will never forget that night or those screams. When I awoke the next morning  I expected to see our bag of cans scattered on the ground  that is how loud the bag of cans rattled  but nothing was disturbed. The cans were  still  all wrapped up in the bag. Nothing else had been disturbed  either. The other thing that has always baffled me about that night was as soon as I spoke to my husband  the cans stopped rattling  and I didnâ€™t hear another sound  except for the distant screams. I was raised out in the sticks  as it is called  in the foothills of North Carolina  and I know that your average nocturnal critter  raccoons  opossums  etc donâ€™t just flee at the sound of a quiet human voice. The sound those cans made was much louder than a small animal rooting around  but still  it could have been any average nocturnal animal. I didnâ€™t look outside the tent  and since I was unaware of the possibility of a Bigfoot creature in the area  it didn  t occur to me to check for prints. The next night  after we had gone to bed  a group of young people pulled in to a site about 20 or 30 yards from us and partied until about 2 30 a.m. After they left  I listened but heard no screams  that night. The night sounds were back  so I slept much easier the second night. Other than the partiers the second night  there were no other campers in this campground the entire time we were there. If anyone else had moved in during the night  I would have heard them. But this campground was nearly vacant  except for us  of course. We were  quite possibly  the only campers for  at least  a few miles from this spot. Iâ€™m not saying  for certain  that what I heard  that night  were Bigfoot calls  but now  I have a good explanation for what has mystified me for years. My husband  who is in the military  recently  transferred to the north central part of the state. Soon  we will be moving to the Alachua/Bradford County area. We are hoping to purchase some acreage out in the country. I canâ€™t wait! My Bigfoot radar will be at peak level! ,Ocala National Forest in a primitive camping area a couple of miles off and to the west of the main forest road. The entrance road to the camping area was a few miles north of the southern entrance  the Welcome Center  of the park. The campsite was surrounded by high brush nearly all the way around three sides  the back side faced the woods. There was a small bathroom at the entrance to the camping area  which was about 100 yards or so from our campsite. This site was the last site before the woods began. There was a trail that dropped out almost right into this site. There was a small lake on the south side of the campground. ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12083,no
1058,My family and I were hiking on a nature walk in the forest. When we walked across a small bridge over a stream. We stopped to rest and i allowed my two sons to go explore. A few minutes later they returned panicing and told me there was a gorilla so i went to go check it out. When we got to where they lead us there was bigfoot nealing next to the stream drinking. It notest us standing there and ran off into the forest. ,Florida  U.S The nearest town was Lynne  in Ocala National Forest.

1059,A few years ago I was visiting friends in Dunnellon  Florida. It was New Years Day 2000. There is a state park called Rainbow Springs State Park. I went to the park that morning simply to bird. This is a fairly large state park but only a small fraction of it is open to the public. That morning I wanted to go outside the public areas of that park  just find a trail and keep walking. The ground was white sand and there were no human foot prints anywhere. I remember this distinctly because I was IDing foot prints of animals and insects. I had a pair of binoculars with me and I was looking for birds as I went along. I figured I was about 2 miles into the park when I came to a clearing  and a stand of White pines on the edge of a field of Saw palmettos. The pine closest to the edge of the clearing had a wood duck box mounted on it. I noticed that right away. It made me laugh because the river or nearest water source was over a mile away. I figured a wood duck that used that nest box would have to be desperate. I decided to look at the box through my binoculars hoping I would see a screech owl using it considering I have seen this quite often.  It was then when I noticed something gripping the tree trunk well below the wood duck box. I thought I was seeing things but it was a reddish brown hairy arm. I raised my binocs to get a better look. What I saw still bothers me today. That arm was attached to something that can only be described as a bigfoot. I got a very good look at it. It was hugging the tree its face pressed to the back of the tree outta sight from the front. It would peek out to look at me then pull back. It had grayish black skin around its face. It was pretty much hairless. It had a human like nose  with a slight nose bridge and a nose more typical of people of African decent. It was not like an apes nose at all. They have flat noses with upturned nostrils. You could not see its nostrils. It had no white to its eyes.The eyes where all brown with black pupils. I could see them dart back and forth  very similar to how a terrified or trapped animals eyes look. Its lips were thin and it appeared that they were long for its mouth looked rather big. There was very little hair around the face. It pretty thick on the sides and top of the face/head. I couldnt see any ears. It appeared to have a very short neck with the back of the neck kinda fading into its shoulders. It had a small cone shape to its head It looked very muscular but not blulky. I moved several times to my right and left to get a better look and it moved just like a squirrel does around a tree trying to avoid you. I can  t say how long this actually went on but it  had to be several long minutes cause I was busy running thoughts through my head as to what I was seeing. The closest thing I could come up with was this had to be an orangutang. The color may have been right but after that  forget it. I decided to move forward   just to get a better look I took two steps toward it (it was about 100 yrds away) and it ducked down and ran like hell. I didn  t see it as it ran away but it left a sea of moving palmettos in its wake. I didn  t make any other noice and I didn  t smell anything. ,Rainbow Springs State Park FL.

1060,A couple weeks ago we all heard it and it sent my then 10 year old son running into the house  still light out but getting dark. It was still pretty far away. Three Sundays ago (10/15/00) the dog kept going off  starting around midnight till 2 30am  my husband C.  went out several times with the rifle but never heard or saw anything. At 2 50am the dog went ballistic and C. told me it was my turn. When I opened the front door you could he it over the dog barking. It was all the way back into my property behind the horse lounge ring at the back of the property line. It continued to sound off as my husband was loading the other rifle for me and then it sounded like it killed something  this was awful. When we got outside  we stood behind the truck about 50 yards from where the noises were coming from. Then it stopped but heard no movement in the woods  the dog continued this entire time sounding off. After about 5 minutes of silence  my husband shot off a round into the ground and could hear it break branches as it moved behind that old parts truck in the woods. Then he let off another round and it went farther in the woods and that was it. I called Fish & Game and went through the same old BS I did a couple of years ago. I went to K-Mart and bought a GE auto voice recorder and we started setting it out at night. We got it on tape that same week  we never heard it from inside the house but were able to hear the dog barking. I have let several people listen to it and no one can ID it. Again  this is not like anything that I heard prior or like on those tapes. Last night (10/28/00) we had a party after my art show  two of the people who previously heard the tape were there. We had a fire going for a bar-b-que and we were all pretty loud. At around 10 00pm you could hear it over all the noise in the same general area. They ALL HEARD IT. Except two women that went to get Lotto  s at the store. Three male friends and one of their girlfriends were over by the lounge ring where they had parked their car. When we ran over to them  the one guy who had  previously heard the tape said  what the #@!% was that?   We heard it moving in the woods and we ran in the house for the recorder and the rifles. Total Chaos!! There were no kids present at this time only adults. We listen to it WALK in the woods and you could hear it breaking branches as it moved. One guy said  Its big whatever it is  And another turned to me and said  it sounds as though it  s walking on two feet . We never mentioned that from the first experience  but we heard it and it did sound as thought it was two footed. C. went back into the house to get the flashlight and he and R. went into the woods  whatever it was stayed at least 100-200 feet away from them. The whole time R. (ex-law enforcement officer & paramedic) could hear it breaking the branches as it moved through the woods as he guided my husband in the general direction it was moving in  (My husband can  t hear certain tones from a far distance) never saw or heard it again.  We also had a Realtor friend  D.  and some good ole boys. A good mix of people and no one could ID the sounds  only that whatever it is has an attitude and is big. The comment was made by more then two people that it sounded as thought it was on two legs. Could not find any tracks  deep layer of oak leaves. , ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12083,no
1061,It  s been 4 years and I have never told anybody about what I saw. I worked in the Ocala National Forest. I maintained 117 miles of forest roads  for logging trucks. It was 95 degrees that day. I thought I had seen everything in that forest  as far as wildlife. But I was wrong.  200 yards in front of me there it was. A large dark brown animal  standing on the side of the road  about 6 and a half feet tall.  It looked at me  and then crossed the road. I drove my moter grader to where it crossed and there they were--the tracks  about 12 inches long. I had no radio  and figured I best keep this to myself. It crossed the road in 3 steps. I had a job to do  and finished grading the road. This is the first time I ever told anyone. I know what I saw  it was real. , ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12083,yes
1062,This morning we were awaken up by the sound of tapping on what seemed like the window of our bedroom. We have three pit bull dogs and they are very agressive when they hear unusual noises but they were terrified by something outside. My son **** went out to see what the noise was and I followed him.  I noticed an awful smell  like something dead or nasty garbage. Then this huge man-like creature ran right in front of us and headed to the woods. I was scared and so was ****. We were both frightened. We just stood there frozen. We have alot of trees on our property and this thing was as tall as our orange tree (about 8 feet). We woke everyone up in the else and kept watching to see it was coming back.  We live on 3.6 acres of heavy wooded property on the edge of the Ocala National Forest. I have never seen anything so scary in my life. This creature was dark and hairy and was walking on two feet. We have just had the storms from Hurricane Frances pass over this Sunday night and the weather has been terrible. We have alot of trees down and power has been out since Sunday. We are hoping this thing does not come back as we are living in total darkness out here and will not have our power restored any time soon. My son  s girlfriend is sending this email to you as we need to let someone know what we have seen. There may have been other neighbors in our area that has seen this but we haven  t be able to talk to them as of yet. , ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12083,yes
1063,My father and I were riding south in our car down forest road 65  in the Ocala National Forest.  We were nearing the point where 65 intersects with forest road 90.  The road is sandy and white  and as we were moving along we noticed a figure up in the distance  silhouetted against the white sandy road that was going up hill.  We were a good distance away  and we initially thought it must be a man  but there was no campground in that area  and besides in July  it is extremely hot out there.  The figure did not appear to be carrying anything  like a hiker would.  There is a trail about a mile or two from this area  but the trail crosses the road a good bit south of where we were.  Anyway as we got closer the figure just seemed to be all dark colored with hair.  It was on the side of the road and as we approached it crossed the road to the other side.  It did not appear to be as big as I would have imagined  but was probably about 5 to 6 ft tall.  When our car got to the point where we had seen it cross into the woods  we stopped and looked  it was just thick piney woods  and we were both really kind of in shock about all of this.  It was a few hours later I realized we should have looked for tracks. What we saw was most definitely not a bear  because this creature walked on two legs for the whole sighting  besides we have seen many bears out there  and we know what they look like. , ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12083,yes
1064,My daughter and i were camping at gore  s landing a small camp ground near fort Mcoy fl  a very small camp ground with around 10 sites. At about 3am we both heard a long high pitched whoop that i  ve never heard before and i  ve lived and hunted in fl my whole life. I have never experienced anything like it  the way it made the hair on my neck stand up. I told my daughter it was nothing but needless to say i was awake the rest of the night. this was in 07 and i havn  t thought much about it until last night i was watching Finding Bigfoot and BoBo made a call and the hair stood up again  it wasn  t exactly like it but pretty close. Maybe someone can tell me what this was because the closest animal i can link it to is a Panther witch sounds like a woman screaming but this wasn  t a panther. ,There is a large swamp there that runs along Oklawaha river up to Silver springs theme park.

1065,I was leaving a hunting camp and just drove on to the main dirt road and picking up speed and I just came over a small hill and I was looking ahead of me and as always looking for deer or a bear crossing the road. In front of me crossing the road was bigfoot it stopped just off center on the road. I hit the binders  it froze and stood there for just a moment. Turned and went back into the timber line. Of course my camera was in the back seat  my cell phone had no signal. I didn  t know what else to do. I was scared. I should have drove up to the spot and tracked it into the timber but I didn  t.

1067,For the last three months I have been hunting a 100 acre family plot of land that borders 8000 acres of WMA (wildlife management area) and I had several encounters with what I believe to be a foul smelling bigfoot. First incident and the closest was when I was in a climber hanging in a palm tree of a new area near a swamp and thick bottom; 30 min after being up in the tree I heard hard steps coming through the woods afterward I heard two loud claps as if something was hitting two trees together. I thought that maybe I may be freaking out over nothing then 4 minutes later I was greeted with the loudest deepest growl I ever heard in my life. Immediately my hair stood up on my head and I was denying that this was happening. After a few seconds of praying and reasoning that this is a figment of my imagination  this animal behind me took a few steps closer then repeated the growl. The second incident happened because I was scared to go into the woods so I took two friends with me on an afternoon hunt. The exact same thing happened that had occurred 3 weeks earlier. To conquer my fear I went back out after four weeks later. I was heavily armed. From a distance I heard a growl around the same time (first dark). Then an animal growled again and immediately I started shooting. I left the woods and the animal moved through the clearing at a pace I never seen. All I know was something was spreading apart the pines like a bulldozer. This incident prompted me to contact someone to investigate this situation. I have often been met by black bears in the woods but never have I experienced anything like this.  I believe we have the prime ground because this animal has become very territorial and refuses to leave. ,Secluded family property bordering a wildlife management area. ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12083,no
1068,On February 21  2012 at aprox 2 55pm while traveling on a back county heavily wooded road in Ocala Florida  I observed an animal coming out of the woods on the South side of the road heading North. From this distance I first thought this was a bear coming across the road  however I did notice that the way this animal carried himself did not appear to be a bear. The animal was walking on all fours but appeared to be larger in the front of his body but lower in the hind end  much unlike a bear. He seemed to be bobbing up and down and seemed to me that it was injured. As I approached closer I could see that he was walking on the knuckles of his front arms  appearance was dark brown shaggy coat  not like smooth sheen coat or  fur that would be on a Florida black bear. As the animal approached the edge of pavement  he then stood up on it  s hind legs with a slight curvature and legs bent  he then crossed the road on its hind legs arms swaying or swinging (longer appearance of arms as that of a primate)as I approach closer to the animal and start to slow my vehicle down  this animal turned its head and glanced partially  (matter of factly). At this point I could tell there were no ears such that a bear would have and knew it definitely was not a Florida black. The upper body was massive and as it went down to the hind quarters got increasing smaller. I would estimate that this animal would be 7ft aprox. weight would be around 400 lbs (my best guess).I could not tell what the hind feet looked like due to the amount of hair but I did note that they were longer than that of a bear. As he neared the edge of opposite side of the road he then returned to walk on all fours and as he entered the edge of the wooded area he stood upright again placing right arm on a pine tree  looked over at me and at this i was at a stand still in my vehicle  I could see a full face. Distance from the animal was 50-60ft away.I could tell that he had more of a round shaped eyes  from this distance they appeared to be dark in color with a lighter color of hair around eyes (short and greyish brown  older in  appearance) same hair color would be around the side of face and what would be the area where the ears would be. The nose appeared to be shorter than that of a bear but different than an ape  didn  t have a larger lower lip or chin. the area where the mouth and nose is was short hair and skin appearance.I could also see that the long hair on the arms did not go all the way to the hand area. Hands seemed from that distance to have five fingers much like that of a primate would have. At this point he entered the wooded area and was out of sight. , ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12083,yes
1069,I was out trail riding in a remote part of the Ocala National Forest when I became stuck in a mud hole. I was out there for several hours waiting for someone to come pull me out. What got my attention first was the sound of someone hitting something against a tree which striked me as odd considering where I was at and I didn  t hear any other vehicles prior to the knock so I proceeded to approach the sounds after walking about 300 yards away from my vehicle I saw what I thought was a huge man in a ghillie suit striking a pine tree with a large stick as I got closer I realized it was not a man but a huge creature that I will never forget as long as I live. It had a huge chest probably 60in. across and though it was in a slumped standing position it had to be 8 feet tall with long muscular arms and long chest and mid section like its legs were shorter than chest area. As I was trying slowly to back away to get back to my truck I stepped on a stick and it immediately turned to look at me using its whole body to do so and then it ran off caring stick in a graceful stride through the woods. ,Off of woods road 572A by squirels nest meadow. ,Marion,40,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12083,yes
1070,I was walking my dog on October 18th  at around 9 00 to 9 10....We had just got back from dinner. We live in a subdivision that backs to the Ocala National Forest. As I was walking towards the end of the subdivision  where there is nothing but open land and empty lots  with some sporadic trees. While turning around  I saw a figure crouching down.  It immediately caught me off guard and quite frankly scared the sh*t out of me.  The minute I spotted the figure  I pulled back on my dog and grabbed my gun.... (I have a permit to carry and we have had a lot of neighbors reporting bears and wildlife in this area) I backed away from the figure and yelled   I got a gun  I will shoot you....**and other things.. I had the leash in my left hand along with my flashlight.  As I shinned the flashlight at this figure again  I yelled at it again..  I will shoot you  I  m not kidding!   Thinking this was a hoax of some kind.  My light caught this figure  s face and I got a reflective shine back at me.... The figure stood up and walked behind this small patch of trees.  This figure was huge.  Looked just like a large ape man  covered in hair. I pulled my dog back with me  and got the heck out of the area.  I didn  t see where it went to after this. ,Ocala Fl - Subdivision  specific street omitted.

1071,We were driving two jeeps through the forest  driving along the inner perimeter road of Hopkins Prairie. We saw a structure in the distance and wanted to know what it was. Found what appeared to be a concrete boat ramp in the middle of the Prairie. We didn  t know the name of where we were until till we started to leave. Looking across the prairie towards the campground (which we also didn  t know was there) when appeared this large creature at about 100 to 150 yards away. We just stood there not saying a word at first. I remember saying to myself  look at those shoulders . It was moving around the edge of the campground right where the grass for the prairie starts. I wear glasses and I had them on so I could see but not as well as the others. I do remember it was just kind of walking in a small area like it was trying to decide what it was going to do and I remember its arms were long just down by its side and swaying. I don  t think it saw us. It turned and walked up into the campground and disappeared. We drove over to the camp ground still not knowing it was a campground to look around. The campground was closed so we went around the fence. We went to where we saw it and noticed a footprint in the wet ground. We also noticed spots where it walked through the tall grass. My nephew tried to step out the places it appeared to step but the stride was to wide for him. We didn  t see anyone at the campground  and it appeared that no one had been to the campground. On the way in to the prairie and before the sighting we saw an abundance of wildlife which I thought was odd. We saw turkey  deer  panther tracks (which we have a picture of) and on the way out after the sighting we saw a black bear that we took video of. All of these animals except for the bear we saw within a matter of minutes of each other. When we saw the creature we just stood there  didn  t reach for cameras. I never even thought to take of picture but we did take pictures of the other animals.

1072,I am a 39 yr. old professional in Miami  Fl. I had an experience 24 yrs. ago that I will never forget. When it first happened  I shared the details with family and a few close friends but no one believed me. It became a topic of such ridicule that I just stopped talking about it (what was the point). I  ve always had a casual interest in the bigfoot dilema. When I moved (in 1974) to south florida  neighborhood kids would tell me stories of a bigfoot-like creature (they called it a  skunk-ape ) roaming the fringes of the everglades with the occasional sighting. They said it was large (about 9  )  smelly and a very swift runner. This all seemed too bizarre and I really didn  t believe them. Then when I was 15 yrs. old I had my experience. I  m not about to say that what I saw was a skunk-ape  but I can say that (since my experience) I absolutely believe that animals (even large ones) can co-exist around us without our knowledge of their presence. Here  s my story .... I was with my family on a summer camping trip at Johnathan Dickinson State Park (just north of Jupiter  Fl). There was an observation tower (about 30 ft high) along the same road that leads to the campground. About 5 30 or 6 00 pm I jogged from the campground to the tower alone (it was probably 2 to 3 miles). When I got there  the fence around the tower was locked. Since this was an un-manned tower setback from a road that had very little traffic (in-fact the entire time I was gone from camp  there were no cars)  I decided I would hop the fence. I  m not one for blatantly breaking rules  so I was very careful not to make too much noise climbing the fence. When I got to the top of the tower  there was a built-in wood bench that wrapped along the perimeter of the deck (about 12  X 12  ). I spent about 5-10 minutes looking in all directions (but there wasn  t much to see). The skys were clear and there was about 45 minutes to an hour of sunlight left. There was a clearing of low-lying brush (about 3-4 ft high) that extended out from the tower for about 30-50 yds. in all directions. At that point it became pretty densely wooded. It was peaceful up there and I was tired so I rested for about 20-30 minutes by laying down on the bench. When I got up  I noticed the sunlight was beginning to fade so I figured I  d better get moving. I remember being upset with myself for staying so long because I would not make it back to camp until nightfall and I didn  t want my parents to worry. When I got to the base of the tower  I climbed the 8   high fence at a point that was perpendicular to the road. Once on the other side  I could walk the 100   or so along the fenceline to the road. Unfortunately  I slipped at the top of the fence so I instinctively pushed off the fence and dropped to the ground on the other side. When I came down  I landed in a bush which made a lot of noise (I had been deliberately very quiet up til that moment. The position of my body was slouched over and facing away from the fence towards the woods beyond the low brush. It seemed as soon as I hit the ground  making all that noise  something popped its head up from under the brush (about 25 yds. away) and I saw it immediately because I just happened to be looking in that direction. I saw just its head at first and we just stared at each other for a few seconds. At first  I was not sure whether I was looking at an animal  s head or a person  s head. I remember it was rounded at the bottom and more elongated towards the top. It seemed a little bigger than mine and was covered with short silvery-gray hair. Its face seemed human with a flat nose  its eyes were small and dark. It made no sound. After a few seconds of silent starring  it turned towards the road and began moving quickly. It seemed to be running on all fours at first; but after about 10 yds. it stood up on just two legs and continued to scamper until it crossed the road and then disappeared into the woods. I would guess that it was about 6-7   tall. It  s frame was very large from the hips up and it was covered with shaggy silvery-gray hair. After it was out of sight  I stood there for a moment trying to rationalize what I had seen. I saw it clear enough to know what it wasn  t. It wasn  t a man - it was definitely an animal. It wasn  t a bear  deer or panther. Not even close. Surprise had turned to confusion and was now becoming fear. I didn  t want to hang around (defenseless) against an animal larger  stronger and faster than myself. I ran back to camp  checking behind me as I ran. By the way it had reacted  I assumed it was probably as scared of me as I was of it. When I reached camp  I tried to tell my family  but they just laughed it off and said it was probably a dog or a homeless man. Of course  I knew this was not the case  so I became upset. Not wanting to continue the conversation  my father became stern and so I dropped the subject. The next day we went home and I  ve never been back. Until recently  I  ve pretty much kept this story to myself over the past 24 yrs. When I found your site (and some others)on the internet and read of other encounters it motivated me to share my experience. I sent info about my experience to a web-site dedicated to finding  skunk-apes   but I really found much of their material to be uncredible. I wanted to share my experience on this site because I feel your opinions and observations are genuine  thoughtful and reserved. P.S. I remember watching the local news one night (around 1977) about a supposed skunk-ape sighting by not less than 14 people during an air-boat ride thru the everglades. They interviewed the driver and a couple of riders who stated seeing a large hair-covered animal walking upright near the edge of an island in the swamp. I thought having so many witnesses would have made this a more credible and compelling sighting. Although I have read of many sightings in Florida which matched the stories my neighbors told me when I was younger  I have never seen or read anything (on the internet) about the airboat sighting. Have you or any of your readers ever heard of this sighting. Perhaps it was proven later to be a hoax or a mis-identification. ,The entrance to the park is off US 1. The observation tower is along the road to the campground. Note  It  s been 24 yrs. and a lot has changed in the area.

1074,I WORK IN STUART AND LIVE IN JUPITER SO MY COMMUTE IS UP AND DOWN US1. I HAD BEEN WORKING LATE SO DRIVING SOUTH JUST AFTER SUNSET. THE ROAD WAS QUIET WITH JUST ANOTHER PICK UP TRUCK APPROACHING MY TRUCK FROM BEHIND. I NOTICED SOMETHING VERY LARGE WALKING ON THE WEST SIDE OF US1 WALKING NORTH SO APPROACHING ME. IT WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE JOHNATHON DICKINSON STATE PARK. MY BEST DESCRIPTION OF WHATEVER IT WAS WOULD BE A HUGE FOOTBALL PLAYER IN FULL SHOULDER PADDING (6-7   TALL) WEARING A FULL LENGTH LONG  SHAGGY FUR COAT. BUT IT WAS AUGUST IN SOUTH FLORIDA....WHO WOULD BE WEARING A FUR COAT? I SLOWED WAY DOWN AS I BECAME LEVEL WITH IT AND THE TRUCK THAT WAS BEHIND ME HAD NOW PASSED ME SO I ALSO HAD THE BENEFIT OF THEIR FULL BEAM HEADLILGHTS. THE OTHER TRUCK SLOWED WAY DOWN AS IT APPROACHED IT THEN ACCELERATED AT A HIGH SPEED AWAY FROM IT....SOMEONE ELSE HAS THE SAME STORY TO TELL. WHEN I WAS PARALLEL WITH IT I GOT A BETTER LOOK. IT HAD THE FACE OF AN APE WITH A   BUMP   ON TOP OF IT  S HEAD. THE FUR WAS LONG AND LOOKED WHITE...KIND OF LIKE A DIRTY WHITE SHAGPILE  CARPET. AFTER READING THE REPORT FROM THE PERSON WHO SAID IT WAS SILVER  THAT COULD BE TRUE AS I  WAS SEEING IT FROM JUST MOONLIGHT AND VEHICLE HEADLIGHTS. IT  WAS INDEED ABOUT 6-7   TALL BY MY BEST ESTIMATE. IT JUST CONTINUED TO WALK  DID NOT TURN TO LOOK AT ME OR RUN AWAY  JUST FOCUSED STRAIGHT AHEAD. I HAVEN  T TOLD ANYONE UP UNTIL YESTERDAY BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE ME  BUT I WAS JUST AT A PROSPECTIVE CLIENT  S HOME WHO WORKS IN JOHNATHON DICKINSON SO I MENTIONED IT....HE SEEMED TO BELIEVE ME AND JUST TOLD ME  I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I  D SEEN ONE.

1075,One night in 1998 my husband (then boyfriend) his friend and I were riding in the woods near our house.  It was hunting season and so we were going shining a.k.a. spotlighting for deer.  It didn  t work so well with three people inside the cab of the truck  so I decided I  d sit in the back and hold the light and both of them could look out of the side windows.  Anyway  we rounded one curve on nice graded dirt road and I shined the field near it.  At the edge of the woods was what appeared to be a bear  but it had red eyes.  This thing  whatever it was  was huge!  I  m no genius but I  d say it stood as tall as 6  5  possibly 7  .  It never ran towards us or anything  but I wasn  t sure what it was capable of so I climbed quickly into the cab through the sliding back window.  My husband  s friend saw it also  as it was on the same side as him...to this day we don  t know what it was.  I don  t think it was a bear though.  I  ve never seen a bear in this area that damn big! ,Off of Doc Whitfield Road  turn right onto Sauls Creek Road.

AS I WENT AROUND  A BEND IN THE ROAD  MY HEADLIGHTS HIT UPON THIS LARGE  BLACK OBJECT AND IT SEEMED TO BE STARTLED BY THE LIGHTS. AS I WAS COMING CLOSER TO THE OBJECT  I COULD SEE IT WAS STANDING ON THE EDGE OF THE ROAD AND IT HAD HUNKERED DOWN SO I COULD NOT SEE ITS HEAD BUT IT WAS STANDING UP RIGHT. NOW AS I GOT CLOSER TO THE OBJECT  I COULD SEE GLISTENING  WET   BLACK FUR. I SLOWED DOWN AND IT TURNED TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD AND DISAPPEARED INTO A SWAMPY AREA. ,IT WAS A VERY DESOLATE AREA AND SEEMED TO BE IN A SWAMPY AREA. ,Gilchrist,1,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12041,yes
1077,In 1994  I was hunting deer and hogs in fla on a farm with a lot of under developed land on it. i was walking around a clear cut heading into the back part of the land i smelled something that did not smell right. the smell was  well as close as i can describe it  like a bear that had been sprayed by a skunk  but i have been hunting all my life and no skunk or bear every smelled like that. i turnd a curve about 40yards away. i saw a animal that was app.6  9  to 7  4 . i am 6  6   and it was taller than i am.the color was a shi--- brenal brown. it was on 2 feet  it turned  i went to my knee to brace for a shot if it came toward me. it ran faster than any man i have seen run. it ran in to the woods. the reason i did not shoot it was possable endangered species or the slim chance it was some one in a suit. i dont think it was a suit. i have been hunting all my life  i still dont know what it was. p.s.  i had a chance to look up the laws if one was shot but can  t find any thing. what do you think the repercusions would be? the fish and wild life say that there is no black fl. panther  but if you shoot one you will go to jail? ,Hwy 97 ,Gadsden,2,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12039,no
1078,Unfortunately  my sighting is not recent at all. It happened in the late 70  s in a town called Flagler Beach on the east coast of Florida. At that time the area was still very rural and undeveloped. Myself and a group of other kids  I think a total of 8 were down a deseted open flat  a small peninsula primarily used for nesting birds. This is late morning under a clear sky in August I should add.  We were near one of the banks when I  felt  something. I look across the water to a hill (approx 200 yds away) covered with course brown grass with a tree stump at the top. Seeing nothing else I went on with whatever we were doing but it occured to me that the  tree stump  was very much out of place on that hill. I look again and  it  has moved downhill closer to us. Realizing it was much taller and moving I pointed it out to the others  turned to see if they looked  when suddenly everyone bolted. Since the older brothers ran I too took off. About a mile later I finally asked why they ran and they said it moved it  s head. To this day I still regret leaving. What description I can give is this   it  was tall  7 ft maybe. It appeared to covered in long brownish/grey fur and it did indeed stand upright. I call it a bigfoot because I am certain of what it WASN  T. Definitely not a bear and the liklihood of it being a human in a costume is extremely remote. My arguement there is one  Fla in August can be brutal even to the locals  damn near suicide to put on a heavy costume out in the sun. Two  the location. With the exception of the hill all else around was marshland  not very easy to get to. I know because I tried to at another time. Also as I stated it was very remote so the liklihood of a hoax at that time and place just doesn  t add up. I cannot give more details of the bigfoot but I can say for myself that I didn  t perceive any danger from it. More of a curiosity. As I stated I ran because the older brothers   did  it was their fear that had me running and to my regret that they did. But I will never forget that day  even now I still can see it all very clearly. ,20 miles north of Daytona Beach on the east coast of Florida ,Flagler,3,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12035,yes
1079,Dear BFRO I have viewed your site  it is very good  it gave me guts to tell my story.  I have never told anyone what happened to me in 1994  I was afraid people would consider me nuts. I was fishing on Escambia river on the Alabama  Florida line. The water was high from alot of rain  the swamps were flooded which made for good bass fishing. It was almost sundown  I noticed that everything was quiet  the frogs  birds  crickets ect...I heard water spashing  I thought it was a deer leaping through the water but what I spotted was a two legged animal walking upright through shallow water and trees. It saw me and started wading toward me.  The water got deeper  almost to it  s chest  it turned away and went back to shallow water.  It watched me for a couple of minutes and wandered back into the swamp. It never made a sound  but it tilted its head back and forth like it was trying to figure me out during the time it watched me..I have sinced purchased a camcorder  but I haven  t seen it again..the one I saw  I would guess it was about six to six and one half feet tall.  It was a dark tan in color but had a little black around it  s shoulders.  Its hair covered most of its body  but it had bare places on its face and elbows.  I would guess it came within 75 yards of me.  I was stunned and very scared. As soon as it was out of site  I left as soon as my motor would start..I often wonder what would have happened if I would have been in shallow water...it did not act as if it was going to attack. To me  it looked as if it was in dispair...there is a lot more to my story  but I  m not a very good typist..thanks...(Name omitted by BFRO) ,The Escambia river is in Florida but in Alabama it is the Conecuh River and when the river is flooded there is a lot of swamp.

1080,I grew up on the Westside of Jacksonville  Duval County  Florida.  I lived near ______ Creek near Normandy Blvd.  My house was the only house on a dirt road approximately 3/10 of a mile from the nearest hard road. As I was walking home  early one evening  I heard heavy sounding foot steps on dried leaves in the woods along the dirt road. I stopped  it stopped.  I walked  it walked.  This happened several times before I hauled ass out of there. A few years later  my brother  a friend and I  were about to do a little fishing in ______ creek.  We took our fishing rods and coolers to the creek and I made a trip back to the car for the tackle boxes.  That  s when I started hearing those heavy foot steps on the dried leaves  again. At first  I paid it no attention  then when the walking stopped  I looked at where the sound come from and saw this very tall hairy creature looking at me from about75 yards away. I still see him  pushing a tree away from his face with his left hand  and when I hollared for my brother and friend to come  look at this thing   it ran into the woods. I later told my mother about this.  She asked me if I remembered the couple who had parked in the woods (about 1965)that had problem and come to the house.  She told me they saw the same thing.  My father told me he saw something like that at the end of our property  at the old cattle gap  watching him work in his garden.  When he looked up  it ran away. ,Unfortunately  this area has homes built on it now.

1082,My father along w/ brothers Eric and Mark at a young age were hunting in the Florida Everglades w/ two friends of the family  Ronnie and George. It was a  boys  trip out. I was approx. 13 yrs  old. I can approximate my age because my family started building a second home behind ours in 1972. It took 3 yrs to build and these  friends of the family  were hired by my father to assist in the project. I was born in 1962 and towards the end of the project  this trip took place. Aprox. in the fall of 1975. Anyway  we drove to a secluded area of the Everglades. Later I was told we were 17 miles away from any paved road. Us  adults  we went out with .22 rifles (my first time)  after parking in what we call now  BFP  at about 6PM.  Ask anybody in South Florida and they know what I mean by  BFP  [Bureau of Fire Prevention land??]. Way out in the middle of NOWHERE. We tracked through waist high vegetation growth when we reached a clearing and continued in a horizontal line towards a tree line approx. 100 yards away. We suppossedly were hunting for rabbits but never saw one. As we approached the tree line we came upon a recently dried out water hole. Here is where I spotted the tracks. There were at least 17  in length. Two half prints and one full print in the mud going into the brushline. The brush on the otherside was thrashed. I recall that we left that area not longer after that. It basically ended our trip. I feel now with what I know  it was a skunk ape. I will swear on the bible on this experience and I have only Eric to back my story. Marc was only 10 and remembers nothing and my dad has passed away. I will take a lie detector test on this event. ,I am not sure if I got the correct highway or even the county (it may be the county south of dade).

1084,In March 1961 The Boy Scout troop I belonged to was camped on Gilchrist Island in Lake Tsala Apopka Citrus County  FL. near Hernando City. The days activities included hiking  swimming  camp craft  night games  and finally on Saturday night the ever popular campfire.  The campout was very exhilerating and when lights out came all found it easy to fall asleep. As Jr assistant scoutmaster it was my responsibility to make sure everyone was in their tents and secure for the night.  As a boy of 17 years of age this position was one of importance and was not looked upon lightly. The days duties were completed about 11 30pm. I walked for approx.  15 minutes from the campsite  down a  moon-lit path without a flashlight to take my evening constitutional. The return trip was uneventful and it seemed unusually quiet for a location normally filled with the sounds of frogs  crickets and occasional bump in the night. I decided to take a shortcut through the forest to bypass a bend in the trail and came into a clearing with what appeared to be a stump. I reached a distance of about 6 feet from the object when it stood up. The creature was 5-6 feet tall weighing about 200-300 pounds. I was 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 120 pounds. The figure in front of me was much broader than I with very long and heavy arms. The moon light source was behind the creature  so consequently eyes or facial features were not discernable. The light revealed a body glistening with long hair. What seemed to be an eternity but was only a few seconds we stared at each other and then he was gone. The creature ran with a long  fast  heavy stride as it crashed through the palmettos until it could be heard no more. The campsite was still when I returned. Frightened  I went to wake up the Scoutmaster  and he suggested a good nights rest and all would be well in the morning. ,Hernando City Rt 41  turn East on Parsons Point Rd; south on N Lake front Drive to fish camp before the dead end for launch point to Island. ,Citrus,4,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12017,yes

1087,Was about 11pm and had stopped in the middle of the road to go to the bathroom.  Nova Road is 30 miles long in cattle country.  After 20 seconds of being out of my car  my sister said someone was coming.  After she said that I heard branches breaking to the side of the road where the woods are.  I glanced to where the sound was coming from and saw a tall dark animal running toward my car.  The animal had to be 7-8 feet tall. After I saw the thing running from the woods on the side of the road  I ran back into my car.  I was scared.  When I first saw it  the thing was running from the woods towards me and my car.  I  m like  we  re outta here.   It ran like a man  upright  It was 11pm  so naturally the color was dark in appearance.  But from my taillights  I  d still say it was dark in color.  And it moved fairly quickly.  Which is why I jumped back into my car so quick.  As I sped away  I tapped my brake lights and saw the thing standing in the road looking at us as we drove away from it.  It was a really creepy feeling!. I still remember it clearly to this day.  It was so errie. ,Brevard County (Cocoa)  Florida.  Around 11pm at night on Nova Road which is off of Route 520.

1088,You have had an encounter with my family  the Bridges over in Quincy  Florida. I now live in jacksonville  Fl. with my boyfriend  his mothers friend has a lake house in Lake Crosby. We took a day trip out there and as we were walking from the end of the dock up to the lake house. It intriged us greatly when we looked to the left and saw a foot print that was not a normal size. We jumped off the dock to get a closer look  it was exactly how a big foot print looks. It was about 11-12 inches long and 5 inches wide. While we were there  there was ducks in the water near shore. The area is very swampy like a marsh  and deserted from a lot of human commotion. Furthermore  my knowledge provokes me to go back to where it was sighted and do further research ourselves. We do believe the area is habitat to big foot. To have your opinion about the situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. , ,Bradford,2,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12007,yes
1089,My Fiance had an accident at work last summer where he received burns on his hand and I had to take him to the burn center in Gainesville at Shands.  I was driving home with him in the car and he was asleep from the painkillers he was on due to his burns. I had my highbeams on and was going ~45mph down SR-16 eastbound near Starke/Camp Blanding. A creature ran across the road on all fours or heavily crouched over. It did not have a tail and in the high beams it looked blueish-grey. Its rear end was pushed up high from the ground  about 4 feet or so  but when it got to the other side of the road it stood up and ran on two legs. I noticed its face was very flat  with no snout or jawline  but with hair all around it. It happened very fast  but I am sure it wasn  t a bear because I couldn  t see a snout  and I  m sure it was not a panther because there was not a tail. Once it stood up it looked to be about 6 foot tall. Once it crossed the road it kept on running into the woods and never slowed down. While it was running on the asphalt it looked like a lemur running on all fours  once it hit the grass it stood up and continued running bipedally without skipping a beat and made maybe three steps until it was in the woods. I turned to my Fiance and asked  did you see that?  but he was unconscious. I didn  t mention it earlier because I never really thought twice about it  but my fiance and i were watching TV and it was a bigfoot documentary  i asked him if he remembered the event  and he said no  but then told me to go ahead and report it to the BFRO. ,Headed east from Gainesville on SR-16 between Starke and Camp Blanding. ,Bradford,2,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12007,yes
1090,I was flipping threw the channels last week watching some late night TV when I saw a program called Finding Bigfoot.It brought me back to the day my mind about that giant changed for me.I only told my mom what I saw.It really changed my life about the unknown.I was running my airboat on the upper St. Johns River doing what I like to do best frog jigging on a Friday night. It wasnt the first time I was out on the river at night I use to run the north and south parts of the river all the time.I still do just at night I make sure I have a running buddy with me.Anyway I was coming up on the oak  s.The oaks are located right next to Duda  s property.Just a wee south of Lake Winder. I figured I would pull up into the oakhead and drink a few cups of joe before I started to gig.Out of the corner of my eye I saw something bolt into the cabbage palms.I figured it to be a hog I really did not know what it was the last thing on my mind was it could of been the big guy.Anyway I ran up on dry ground about 15 yards spun my boat around so it was pointed toward the river and shut it down.I just poured a cup of joe when I herd something about 10 yard behind me.It sounded like it was wrestling with a cabbage palm.Or maybe rolling around in a bunch of palms.Then out of know where I herd a thump right next to me boat.I looked but did not see anything then again I herd it behind my boat then something hit my rudders I turned on my head lamp and saw mud on my rudders I then saw a bunch of mud fly over me and hit my bow I shined my light in the direction of where it was coming from and I saw his face.I lost all feeling in my body I just about passed out I was lost I didnt know what to do.I was in total shock.I just about peed my pants I was so scared.I never in my natural born life moved so fast to crank my boat and got the heck out of there.I almost sank my boat when I hit the river. I just went north knowing I would be in the lake.I was scared to drive home so I parked in the middle of Lake Winder and took a few sips of drink to calm my nerves and try to talk my self out of what I saw I stayed there untill first light.When I got home I went and seen my mom and had to tell her what I saw. I told her the story because it scared me so.I am a man and I am tuff but that scared the living heck out of me.I figured I should share my story just like others are on that tv show. ,The Oak  s Upper St.Johns River ,Brevard,7,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12009,yes
1091,We were heading home from work approximately 11pm. There was rain and we came up on what we thought was a person along side of the the road but as we got closer  what we saw was something that was around 7 feet to 7 1/2 feet tall.Long dirty shaggy yellow looking hair. Could not see the face well because of all the hair. It had a tarp or piece of plastic over it. It was getting ready to cross the highway from a wooded area. As we passed it  my friend and I started describing what we both had seen and cold chills ran through my body. We were going to turn around and see if we could figure out what it was  but were to scared to. I have never seen anything like that in my life. It was not a man  it was entirely too tall.

1092,I  m a fishing guide in Florida for over 25 years and spend apx 200 days on the water a year. On a charter last month I had a Delta pilot and lawyer on my boat. As we poled into a remote area of the Merrit island National Wildlife Refuge I noticed something bent over and walking up a sand bank apx 100 yards from us. It was just after good daylight. I thought bear? hog? as it walked closer one of my clients noticed it and said  what the f(*& is that?  I was speechless it walked to within 40 yards stood up and faced us for about 15 sec. It took 3 steps turned sideways and looked at us over it  s shoulder for another 10 sec then walked into the mangroves. The pilot said that was a F(*& sasquatch! It was apx. 6/7 ft tall long reddish brown hair  and was built like a side by side fridge very square. It  s face looked more cave man then ape. The wind was in our face and we were silent in my flats skiff I think that is why he did  nt know we were there as he was hunting the sand beach for food. ,North Mosquito Lagoon ,Brevard,7,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12009,yes
1093,I was driving down state road at 9pm on 9/17/11. This road is good for heavy traffic and none at all. At the time I was the only car on the road going both directions.  I was headed south towards state road 528. 407 runs adjacent to the Canaveral marsh lands full of deer  hogs  birds and plenty of other native wild life. at 9 10 or so I saw what appeared to be a skunk ape cross the road right in front of me.  This road fits one car in each direction. The skunk ape appeared to be running because it crossed the road in 2 step very easily. After the second step it jumped down into the side embankment and into the bushes next to the road.  I did get a good look at it since I driving at a pace to avoid hitting deer that cross the road frequently. The animal had long hair all over its body. Especially on the arms and shoulders. This is the reason I know it was in a sprint. The hair was flowing like it would if it was blowing in the wind. The color of the hair seemed to be dark. Reflecting against my head lights and the moon light I really couldn  t tell the color. It had a cone shaped head  Very longs arms. When it jumped down into the embankment the arms went up in the air as to help keep its balance or not hit anything .  I saw the side profile of the face. The face was dark ( again night time ) it seemed ape like. The feet where huge. as it took steps I noticed how large they were.  The over all body seemed very THICK. The animal was very muscular. From the side view I had   you could see just how thick of a body it was. I didn  t stop to investigate due to the face that it was night time and I did not want to have a face to face with what ever I saw alone on a dark road. Thinking about the situation as it constantly replayed in my mind . I think it might have been in pursuit of a deer. I constantly see deer on that road at night into the early morning. This was my first time seeing a skunk ape  but I have heard they were sighted some times in the area further south on state road 520. I feel with the rise in the deer population it might have moved into the area. ,south bound side of state road 407 adjacent to the Canaveral marsh lands ,Brevard,7,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12009,yes
1094,Me and my neighbor were sitting in a hunting blind for about 2 1/2 hours when the woods suddenly went quiet. Then we heard some crashing in the bushes about 300 yards away. So I told my neighbor to put on his walker game ear headphones. I thought it was pigs and was curious to see if he could pinpoint where they were but the crashing got louder and he said the foot steps sounded like a man  s gait  2 legs then all the sudden a big boom and then the loudest and creepiest howl I ever heard nothing like a man or animal I  ve ever heard. So we sat till after dark hoping to see it then we packed up and began walking back to the boat  we got about 200 yards down the dirt road we were walking and I decided to turn around and 50 yards behind me is the glint of eyes about 7 feet off the ground  and it turned away and ran. ,Please do not include location online ,Brevard,7,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12009,yes
1095,This is being typed by the investigator as told by the hunter.  I was turkey hunting on April 5  2015 and I cut across a field of sawgrass and found what appeared to be a mound of dead sawgrass piled high which did not occur naturally. It was obvious it has been pulled up by hand and was some sort of a bed or nest. I  ve never seen anything like it. To my knowledge there isn  t any animal that can do this.   It was larger than the bed in my pickup truck.   When I got home  I told my nephew about it. He asked me to go back and take a photo of it. The next weekend  I did. He contacted the BFRO for me.  ,Off St. Johns River. Swampy area with areas of high ground. Protected area. ,Brevard,7,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12009,yes
1096,In 1974 I was 12 yrs. old visiting my sister M and her family in Davie FL with my cousin A who was 15 at the time. One night we were sleeping on a pull out couch in the sitting room. When we smelled something like a skunk only worse  we asked my sister what it was she said it was the Skunk Ape and he comes around in the hottest summers. We didn  t believe her so we asked our friends and they said it was real. One night while we were sleeping we seen a huge shadow come across the picture window. Then it turned looked at itself and let out a blood curdling scream that scared us half to death. Then it turned and walked to the side of the house and we followed it by going in the side bathroom. There it squatted down to eat a wild watermelon then it went to the back of the house to a man made lake  squatted down and drank some water. A few nights later the beast attacked a wild horse in its coral but the horse got away by jumping over the coral and ran off into the pasture. The rancher came out and took a few shots at the beast but it got away. When the horse came back it had finger prints on its hind quarters  not scratches but finger marks. A few nights later the beast came back and killed a farmer  s bull. The farmer took a few shots at the beast but missed it.  At the same time my sister and her husband J were coming home from a night out and the sheriff and his deputy were on patrol. We jumped into Joe  s car and followed the Deputy when the beast stepped out of the darkness and was hit by the police car. The beast went down and when it got up it looked into the police car and let out a blood curdling yell. We were about 10ft behind the Deputy car when the beast hit the police car with both hands and the back of the car came off the ground. Then it limped off into the swamp. When the Sheriff got there the car looked like it hit a utility pole. Just then the farmer came over and told the sheriff that his prized bull was dead. This bull was huge at least a ton with it head ripped off and thrown across the pasture. That  s when they called in the state police with their horses & dogs & helicopters  they searched the swamp all night but found nothing. ,Sunshine acres  University Rd. 106th & 111st  Griffin Rd. ,Broward,5,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12011,yes
1097,My brother and I observed a large  black-brown human-like form near a large tree that had a branch some 18 inches in diameter hanging over a dirtbike trail.  We heard grunting and movement in the bushes next to tree and then saw that particular branch snapped in 2 with ease at it  s base.  Then whatever it was ran into the woods leaving a path of destruction  mostly small trees laying down. ,Florida  Broward county  Coral Springs  between Wiles Rd. and Sample Rd. ,Broward,5,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12011,no
1098,Forgive me for not knowing the exact year. It was around 1980 or 1981. My brother  I and a friend were hiking in an old cow pasture that was very overgrown. Back around 1980  Davie still had lots of woods and overgrown orange groves. Sure  I had heard of the skunk ape  but was never concerned. Being a boy  I was adventurous. Anyways  we were in the pasture hiking when we found an old tractor trailer. The trailers doors were missing  the were off and lying rotten on the ground  (with trees growing in them). We noticed that the trailer smelled real bad. We decided to climb in and look around. All we found was stench  like an animal lived in there. We were too far from the road for a bum to wander in and there wasn  t any sign that anyone  kept the place up . We lost interest in the trailer and started to hike some more. We came upon a canal that forked with another one. To make a long story shorter  I saw something looking at us from across the canal. We were still about fifty yards from the edge of the canal at this point. Whatever it was didn  t take notice of us right away  but as we got closer it looked up and raised its  arms  above its head as if it was waving at us. This area was very overgrown and all of my previous trips  I had not seen anyone out there. Whatever this was scared us all so bad  we ran all the way home  locked the doors and didn  t return to the area until a few years later! My brother  now  says that we were imagining it. I have thought that it was a snake bird (you know  the ones that sit on a post and spread their wings to dry). However  I keep replaying the incident in my mind and I don  t see a snake bird. There was a humanoid head and the colors were all wrong. Snake birds are usually blackish..what I saw was more brown... ,Davie  Broward County  1 mile north of Orange Drive  and about 1 mile east of Hiatus Road.

1099,Myself and my brother both had separate encounters with it in the Spring and Fall of 1994  respectively. I first encountered  something  in the spring of 1994 when camping with a group of friends in the woods bordered by Lyons rd to the west  the Florida Turnpike to the east  Sample road to the south  and the Winston Park development to the north. I left the camp alone at about 1 00 am heading east  towards the Turnpike on a trail. I began to hear what seemed to be footsteps in the woods maybe 5 - 10 yards to my right. I  d also like to say that I smelled a musty odor  but I could be inserting that into the report - it  s been awhile since I had the encounter  and my recollection isn  t as clear as I wish it were. Regardless I continued to walk  and the footsteps were remaining parallel with mine  and it bacame clear that whatever was two my right was walking on two feet from the stepping pattern. I started to get a little frightened  because the area where the footsteps were coming from was a thicket of Brazilian peppers - difficult to walk through during the day  and nearly impossible to manage in the night. I heard it move closer  and I turned around  and walked briskly back to camp. I woke my friends  and we went back to find it  although it was gone at the time. I remember leaving with the impression that I had encountered a sasquatch (which must be because of the scent)  although I wrote it off as a figment of my imagination - that it must  ve been a farmer or a vagrant in the woods. I preceeded to forget about the incident  and never mentioned it again. About six months later  my brother was in the same woods  maybe a half mile from where I had my  encounter   walking at night with a friend. He turned a corner from one trail to another  and  bigfoot  was standing at the intersection of the two trails. He said that it had reached out for him  and he and his friend ran off. He told me about the experience  and I then related mine. We had a running joke for awhile that there was a  monster in our backyard.  I  d like to be able to have my brother provide his report  since he had a sighting and is a better and more credible witness than I am  but he passed away at the end of 95 (I believe I might be able to find the friend  however) Regardless  I wanted to report the incident for a few reasons - first - it  s a very unusual area to encounter an creature like this - the area is surrounded on all sides by a significant amount of development. While there remained a good deal of open land  including a tomato farm  a tree farm  Tradewinds Park  and some undeveloped land  it didn  t strike me as being an area where one would have thought to find a creature like this - there doesn  t seem to be too terribly far for this thing to go without being spotted. Further  given the amount of development that has gone into the area since  its range is becoming severely limited. Still  the 1975 Broward report happened about a mile or two west of where my brother and I saw it  so it must have found a way to adapt. It  s possible it could move along the turnpike and the sawgrass expressway somewhat unnoticed  making it over to the nearby landfill  as well as Quiet Waters Park  although it appears unlikely that it could  ve gone too much further without being caught in the middle of suburbia. Given the amount of development that has since gone into the area  it  s range is further being restricted. It might be a very lucrative area to investigate. At the rate development is going  if it still back there  it  s going to be encroached upon sometime soon. ,Lyons halfway between Sample and Hillsboro  roughly where the Wiles rioad extension is being built. ,Broward,5,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12011,yes
1100,Back in 1985-86 my family relocated to Coral Springs from Miami before the Sawgrass Express way was built. We lived so close to the Glades my friends and I used to ride our skateboards to the levy and watch the Everglades burn (at that time  some firebug had set quite a blaze). On some mornings we  d wake to cars and yards covered in ash. Needless to say  a lot of wildlife began to migrate closer to our neighborhood i.e. deer alligators  whatever. One night we pitched a tent in my friends back yard approx.  50 yrds from a canal that separated us from an apartment complex and across from that was the beginning of the everglades. The fires had been raging for weeks and people in the area were reporting missing pets  some of which were inside 6 foot privacy fences. We used to run between houses to cut through to go home. This night in particular  before we called it quits  we played a bit of hide and seek. I remeber hiding under a window box behind a bush and got spotted by an unmarked police car. We really thought we were in trouble  but the police were looking for a person that had been peeping in windows. We assured the police we weren  t the perps and went on about our business and went to the tent. 3 kids in a tent don  t sleep well  so we were having fun cracking jokes and noticed a sound coming from across the canal approx 100 yrds away. Something was slamming the dumpster lids in the complex across the way and making low deep sounds  grunts. These were tall dumpsters. You  d have to get a boost to lift the lid. We got real quiet trying to listen to figure what it could be. At first we figured a cow got loose and possibly was bumping into the dumpster. But  it became evident that wasn  t so. One of the kids I was with turned on a flashlight and started making shadow puppets with his E.T. stuffed animal. Then the thing from across the canal took notice of us for the first time. The grunts were still audible but with what I would say is with a hint of curiosity. We got quiet and real concerned putting 2 and 2 together. Could this be what the police were looking for? The steps grew closer and closer. I remember we tried to figure if it was a quadraped or biped. When the steps finally stopped  the breathing grew louder  then SPLASH!!! Whatever it was was 50 yrds from us and coming right in our direction. We sprinted for the house waking up my friend  s family. They were woken by 3 screaming kids at 2a.m. exclaiming something is out there. His dad grabbed his shotgun  turned on the flood lights.  He went out to look around and found the tent was demolished and covered in water. I swear I could feel this thing  right around the corner in the shadows looking right at us. We did not let his father investigate further until morning and couldn  t beleive the tent had been moved from its postion. I have no doubt had we stayed in that tent this story would be much different  if at all. I am 35 now and have never forgotten that night. ,it is in the story ,Broward,5,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12011,yes
1101,My family moved to Charlotte County in 2000  bought a house in a quiet area and have been pleasantly surprised with the amount of wildlife in the area.  We had moved from Ft. Lauderdale and would frequently exercise  bike ride  walk  run or rollerblade.  It was January 2001 or 2002  sunny day  a cold front just went through the area.  It was mid-afternoon  about 65 degrees  wind was out of the North  North East.  I even remember what I was wearing.  My wife and I decided to go Rollerblading that day  and we had a basic route we skated.  As we made our way away from our house we got to one of our favorite roads  Koala  and proceeded down to the end at an easy pace.  About 2-3 blocks from the intersection of Koala and Collingswood we stopped and saw what I first thought was a very large dog  on all four legs  in the swale about 20 ft. from the intersection.  I looked at the animal and I thought I was looking at the profile of a dog  a really BIG dog.  Although I did not see a tail or a head I did not give it another thought.  I remember saying to my wife   We should have brought a lead to see if someone lost a dog.  I would hate to see it get hitâ€.  As she was agreeing with me  we just started to move towards the animal and all of a sudden its head rose up and stared right at us.  The animal was not in the swale in a profile view on all fours  it was on all fours facing us.  It had a dark face which did not register with me.  The hair was long  reddish-brown.   As the animal looked up at us there was about a 2 second delay before it took off at an alarming pace.  RIGHT FOR US. Fight or flight sense kicked in. It started running  I looked at it as it gained speed and its hair was flowing in the breeze  there was no standard locomotive process.  It seemed to float.  The shoulders did not break a plane.  We turned around and started to get the heck out of there.  We feared that this animal was after us.  As I kept checking back at it  thinking I may have to confront it  I saw it move from the swale to the roadway effortlessly.  Again it appeared to float up the bank to the road.  Once in the road I could see the hair moving in the wind as it chased after us  I could see the front legs moving but the shoulders never broke a visual horizontal plane.  It took up a quarter of the roadway   3-4 feet across  I would estimate 4-5 foot at the shoulder.  The animal drifted off into the woods to the north side in to an area that appeared to have been an opening made through the brush.   Maybe we were too close to its lair.  I donâ€™t know.  I do not know what it was  I thought perhaps at first it was a dog  then maybe an exotic large cat  or a bear but I ruled them out just due to the unbelievable speed  overall size (huge) and locomotive process this animal executed.  It just appeared to float. The whole thing lasted probably 20 seconds.  I still get the chills thinking about it and when I go past that area. ,On Koala just east of intersection of Collingswood.

1102,My husband and I have lived in Charlotte County FL our entire lives. We have camped with our families for over 40 years up the peace river (only accessable by boat) into Desoto county...After Hurrician Charley  We had gone early to set camp and meet friends.  Later that evening  we heard an undescribable screem/yell/growl from somethin very big.  Because of the number of alligators there  I at first thought an animal was getting bitten and dragged into the water as we heard water splashing and the yell continued and went from sounding hurt and suprised to angry and mad  (I had heard for a long time that there was a big foot in that area  but have never heard  smelled  or seen anything...well into our 40  s we never thought we would.)  The yell lasted approx 5 seconds  going from something sounding like it was hurt fighting and then angry.  It made our hair stand strait up.  My husband immediately retrieved his gun  and we were very uncomfortable all evening.  We have never heard anything like this before...until...we watched a special on bigfoot and the gentleman from florida stated he had audio.  When we heard the audio  we both jumped to our feet in shock  as it was the same type of yell we had heard up river...It is a sound you would never forget. ,Very primitive..swampy area with a fresh water river  only accessable by boat...We can take you to the place where it happened. ,Charlotte,6,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12015,no
1103,In the spring of 2006 several members of the countyâ€™s development review team (planners  engineers and legal) were invited to tour a 90 000 acre ranch that was proposed for development.  The intent was to give the reviewers a â€œbase-lineâ€ as to existing conditions  identify areas to be developed  and areas proposed to be established as a nature preserve. The developer provided a â€œswamp buggyâ€ for the tour.  It was an  old  modified (top removed) school bus with large tires.  It maneuvered around the ranch  much of which was swamp  for a little more than two hours. The ranch extremely active with wildlife â€¦ the fields and pastures with deer and wild pigs; the swamp with large birds and dozens of gators.  Although the ranch was laced with timber and crop roads  many were flooded from a very wet winter / spring and therefore the swamp buggy was forced to take routes not often traveled.  Near the end of the tour about two miles from the ranchâ€™s bunk houses and barns   the driver had to tap his breaks to avoid a family of wild hogs (2 large and 3 small).  The guide  who was also the ranch manager  mentioned the wildlife was much more active than usual  offering that it was because of the heavy rains and flooded areas â€¦  joking that â€œwe even brought out the three little pigs for you.â€  I was sitting next to where the guide was standing and I said â€œyeah  you even provided a gorillaâ€. He looked down at me but said nothing as I pointed out of the bus across a flooded area to a small rise  maybe 150 yards away.  He said nothing so I let it drop. A few days later a member of the legal staff that had taken the tour came to me and asked what did I mean when I mentioned a â€œgorillaâ€ on the tour.  I explained while others were watching the hogs run to the left of the bus I was looking at the flooded pasture to the right and had seen a large bipedal standing slightly over the rise.  I described what I saw and she said â€œyou need to talk with Rich (county attorney) â€¦  he saw it too.  We saw exactly the same thing â€¦  a very large bipedal (7â€™ or more) standing just over the rise (could see it from knees up) with itâ€™s back to us.  It was covered with very dark hair  no neck â€¦ what I would call bullet shaped and was from 125 to 150 yards away.  It was only visible for maybe 5 seconds because as the bus kept moving heavy growth blocked the view â€¦ but for those 5 seconds it was an unobstructed view.  As the bus passed  the creature turned  assumingly to see what the engine noise was â€¦ but the entire upper body turned from the waist.  As it turned  it appeared to be holding something in its arms. ,From I75 south take exit #164  take US17/Duncan Rd north 1 miles to74/Bermont Rd  go right on 17 about 15 miles.

1104,Just got up for work and was walking the dogs outside my home. I looked toward the end of the street and it looked like a truck or something in the middle of the road. I turned away for a few seconds and looked back again. It had covered a distance a person couldn  t cover and stopped as soon as it saw me looking. The wind was blowing toward the creature so the dogs did not pick up on it till after we were in the house. So we started this little game where I would look away and it would move quickly forward. When I would look toward it again it would freeze. It didn  t growl or make any noise. It finally hit me that this was not a game  I was not seeing things and that it was moving directly for me and the dogs. Frankly I really didn  t want to believe what I was seeing. Judging by the posts  mailboxes  trees etc. that it stood by it was probably between 8 to 9 feet tall  had long hair  long arms  very muscular  big chested and was HUGE! It was built like a brick building so to speak. I have never seen an animal that big that could be so agile and move so fast and quietly. As soon as I knew I was not seeing things I carefully manuvered the dogs to the house and shot into the house. After we were in the house the dogs barked as it followed me up the driveway!!!!!! I think it came right up to the front screened door as the motion light kept going on. Frankly I was too afraid to look out the windows and cowarded with the dogs in the kitchen till I thought it was gone. The odd thing was that for the next 3 mornings (same time)there was a very strong musty or poopy odor outside the front door that hung like a wet blanket in the air. As soon as I opened the door and smelled it I shut the door because I felt it was in the yard. As a result of this encounter I would only go outside after daylight and when I heard other cars moving in the neighborhood. I started going to work late (had an hour and 1/2 ride to Bonita Springs) but wouldn  t tell my boss why I was coming in late. My step-dad was sick so he thought it had something to do with that. He would NEVER have believed me if I told him that I saw a Skunk Ape and was afraid of it!

1105,I have a few  where I live in Charlotte county  borders the web reserve  and is woods for miles and miles  when I started to build my home  just after hurricane Charlie  I had an rv trailer on my property to live in while my home was being built  so I could keep an eye on the building supplies  I had a hot tub outside of my trailer and I would take a soak in it every other night or so usually after midnight  many times I would hear what would sound like someone smacking 2 2x4s together some distance away  and sometimes it would come from different directions  I would sit there thinking to myself why in the world is someone working out here in the woods at 1am  but I just blew it off  after the home was built I didn  t hear the wood smacking anymore  because I was in my home and not outside late at night  then I had a deck built on the front of my home  my home is a 2 story home and the deck is on the second floor in the front  after the deck was built we started using it at night and would you believe it I started hearing the sticks hitting again every once in a while not every night  still I was thinking to my self why is someone working so late at night  then I was watching a bigfoot show and saw that they bang sticks together to talk to each other and then it all made sense to me  about 5 months ago one of my lids to one of my fish boxes were lifted off and about 20lbs of mullet were taken out of my boat in my yard  I went out to my boat around 3am to get ready to go fishing and during my walkaround of the boat to check the lights and tires I noticed my ice box lid not on  the lid weighs around 40 to 45lbs and has a bungee cord on it  the bungee cord was still attached but the lid was pulled to the side and fish were taken  and I had a weird feeling that something was looking at me so i fixed the lid and jumped into my truck and drove off  also about 3 or 4 months ago I took my son on a cubscout camp out and we had a small group of around 12 to 15 children  usually there are over 1000 people at a camp out but this time it was just our pack on a special camp  I woke around 230am to use the bathroom and then laid down to go to sleep then I heard a yell that lasted for about 10 seconds and it sounded like one of the yells that I have heard returned on one of the shows on tv  I was born and raised in the woods in fla and am a commercial fisherman and know all the sounds that you will hear in the woods and near shore  and in fla we have a bunch  some from normal animals like foxes or bobcat or panthers will make you get chicken skin and your hair stand on end  but the yell I heard that night was like nothing I  ve ever heard  it didnt scare me but I knew what it was. ,(specific directions omitted) ,Charlotte,6,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12015,yes
1106,We were out shining deer in central Florida. It was about 2 00am and we hit a pair of eyes that appeared to be approx.7 to 8 ft. up. At approx. 150 ft. The eyes were at least 1 ft. apart! I thought at first it was a big owl but as we were pulling away we heard the most unbelievable scream. It scared my dad so bad that he stalled the truck trying to get out of there! As I look back on it that probably was not the proper response but things happen. We never went back to look for any signs but I have been back to the area since then and I believe that there is enough room to support at least a breeding pair of bigfoot/skunkape whatever it may be! ,Citrus county Fl. approx. 10 miles N. of Brooksville.

1107,I have hunted in most of the management areas in and around this state. I was on a bow hunt in the Citrus wildlife management area. I go out 1 hour or so before daylight. I had put my stand out the day before and just parked in pitch black dark area. I got out and walked to the other side of the suv to get my stuff out  before I could do that I heard something jump out of the bushes behind me. I stood motionless and a strong smell of defecation was there. I talked about the smell and it disappeared. I opened the door and got my flashlight to see what was there and it was gone. By the time daylight rolled around there was six or so more cars that had come through and wipe out all tracks that I could have found. This was the first of 5 incidents of it.   2. Two weeks later I moved my stand to a different area due to all the other hunters. I went out an hour before daylight again and parked got in my stand and waiting for daylight. Right before daylight I heard a call unlike anything I have ever heard before. I have heard hogs  deer  and all other types of animal calls including bears. This call was not like any of them. As the morning went by more cars and hunters came into the area. I heard something big running towards me and it sat down 20 to 30 feet in front of me on the only blind spot I had. I waited for about ten minutes and figured another hunter had sat there  so I cleared my throat to see if it was human and it got up and ran off real fast. I couldn  t see it. 3. Two or three weeks later I decide to go fishing at the gulf and was driving past the area I hunted at when out of the wood line a big hairy  black bigfoot ran in front of me with my bright lights on. It took 3 leeps from woodline to woodline. the run is what floored me. The knees almost hit the ground before it came up again and out to the side of its foot. ,I measured 2 tracks for you but no pics. I got a camera phone now. ,Citrus,4,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12017,yes
1108,Yesterday  on October 31st  2010  I was hunting in Flying Eagle WMA with a friend when I discovered something that I thought was very unusual. It was around 10 20 in the morning when we decided to meet back up and do some scouting for our last afternoon hunt on my quota. I had set my friend up a few hundred yards or so from Hwy 44 in the morning before daylight and I continued on for about 3/4-1 mi. on the edge of the swamp we were hunting. As I continued on I jumped something that ran off and sounded unlike a deer or hog but didn  t think anything of it. We were sitting on ground. After we met up we started walking back towards the truck and saw a couple of wet areas (puddles) when I said to my friend  let me check and see if there are any prints leading to the water to get a drink. As I walked over there to see I looked down and noticed something out of the ordinary. I called my friend over to show him. It was a footprint  similar to a humans. Not real large but kind of wide for the length of it. It was so fresh that you could still see the thermal lines in the mud from the bottom of the foot. It was the only one that we could really make out. The heal and ball made deep impressions while the toes were not really deep in the mud in comparison. I had my cell phone with me so I took two photos of the print and one of the area we were in then he marked a tree next to it so we could find it again. It just seemed very odd to find a print like that in the middle of a swamp! We returned after lunch for an afternoon hunt. I did notice one other thing with the squirrels after we returned. I didn  t go as far this time  but I noticed the squirrels barking more than usual off in the distance. It is how they warn others of pending danger. As time went on they got closer and closer to where I was sitting and then all of a sudden went silent. Just an observation! I have spent most of my life in the woods in florida either hiking  biking or hunting this was the first time I noticed something like this. It is probably human but who would be out there barefoot?? We ended up laughing quite hard about it after we named him Eddie the Yeti and I will ad this is not the first time I have heard or smelt something out of the ordinary while in the woods. ,Located in Flying Eagle WMA about 5 miles East of downtown Inverness. ,Citrus,4,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12017,yes
1109,The following is the account of my student  identified below. He is with me as I type this. He does not have a computer  so I therefore am making this report for him. I am his high school biology teacher.  We (4 of us) were riding in a pickup truck on a dirt road on my grandfather  s property. That portion of the property is planted pine flatwoods with little undergrowth other than native grass. Three of us were in the back of the pickup  looking for deer with a spotlight. We were traveling about 10 mph. The person with the spotlight swept the light across the side of the road  and all 3 of us that were in the back of the truck saw this creature standing about 25 feet from us  and back off the road in the trees. It was just standing there looking at us. The light swept across the creature  and all three of us saw it and yelled or said something. The light was on it a second or two. We immediately backed up and with the light looked again but could no longer see it creature. It was gone. We were all very excited asked each other what it was  but confirmed that we had all see the same thing. Here is what we saw  It was about 8-9 feet tall  and covered with long dark fur. There were no ears on the head  but it  s eyes shown yellow in the light and the sholders appeared like a football player  s. His belly stuck out to the sides a bit  like he was thicker in that area. His arms were long and appeard to hang nearly to his knees. When we backed up to see him again  he was already gone  but we all noticed a really foul smell  that I would describe as similar to a sour hog. We were all fairly scared  and immediately left the area. ,This road passes from Interstate 10 to Hwy 21. ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12019,yes
1110,One night in early April of 1994  my two daughters and I were driving in our car  headed west  on SR 16 near Penny Farms in Green Cove Springs  Florida. The stretch of road was lightly scattered with houses  but had mostly dense wooded areas with an occasional cow pasture. The weather was clear with a light night fog. As we approach one of the more deserted areas along the road  I spotted something off to the right hand side of the road. At this point it was not clear as to what it was. I slowed down a bit thinking it may be a dog or animal. I  ve commonly seen many nocturnal animals along this stretch of road in the past. As we approached somewhat closer  it stepped out into the path of the car. We  at this time  were moving approximately 20 MPH as the animal came in to direct headlight. I was stunned to see that which I had assumed would be a raccoon  actually stood at least 6 to 7 feet tall  walked on two legs  and was covered with brown hair  (was somewhat skinny). I completely stopped the car as it crossed the road. A car coming in the opposite direction stopped as well. I almost could not come to terms with what my eyes were seeing. My oldest daughter  which was nine years old at the time  said  oh my gosh! What is that?â€ It crossed the road quickly into the thick brush on the left hand side of the road. Once again she said  Dad  what was that?  I sat there with my mouth hanging open  then tried to think of what to say that wouldnâ€™t spook her. We had just passed a cow pasture about 30 feet prior  so I babbled   I a...a...a think it was a cow.  We drove silently for a few miles. The whole time I  m thinking to myself   You just saw a Skunk Ape . She then turned to me and said    Dad  cows don  t walk on two legs... Looked more like a Bigfoot to me.  I stuck with my ridiculous  cow story  until she was much older. She  s now 18 years old  and we  ve laughed about the cow story for years. These days we both use each other as our witness that on that April in 1994 we both did truly indeed see a Bigfoot. My youngest daughter was asleep in the back seat during the entire event. But she says she has seen plenty of cows anyway. Cows... INDEED! ,SR16 near Penny Farms in Green Cove Springs. About a 1/2 mile from CR218.

1111,It was a warm day in June of 2005 it was around noon and me and three of my friends decided to go fishing we had cooked left over pork chops as bait since where we were fishing on private property and we were tresspassing I have been reluctant to say anything about this  after about an hour or two of fishing the older of my two friends said  Hey (name) I think theres a bear in those pallmetos.  So I being the oldest of the three decided to go over to the bushes and check it out when I got about ten feet from the bushes I saw two dark brown eyes filled fear and curiosity I stopped dead in my tracks and then the creature let out a loud grumbleing noise so naturally being as terrefied as I was I let out a yell which is when I saw the creatures eyes go from fear and curiosity to rage and anger then it rose out of a crouching position to tower about nine feet above me I can distinctly remeber the odor coming off the creature and around the eyes there was no fur the creature also had a very noticible mark on it face right above the upper lip I cant remeber if it was the left or right side  the creature had a flat nose kind of like a gorilla and human mix the skin was really dark and course the creature had extremely long arms and also there was no hair around the lips the fur was really dark and notted sort of like a matted dog.  So after the creature rose out of the crouching position we all ran up the hill to the house to get a camera and a .270 we returned to the scene several hours later to find the pork chops gone the fish gone the poles scatterd around on the ground and we had all had our shirts off since it had been hot and they were laid about 11 feet up on a live oak branch with no sign of the creature left. Then about five days later I was riding my bike down a trail that is by my house going to a freinds house who lives on bluejay when out of the corner of my eye I saw something that grabbed my attention I looked to my left to see a huge creature walking across the scrub oaks about 200 yards away this was to the left of me by the swamp which has since dried up so I proceeded to quickly turn around and head home. And recently since about the begining of the summer of 2007 I have been hearing wood knocks in the woods by my house  normally they come from three diffrent locations but sometimes there will be four or five  the knocks are about two to three minutes apart the most recent knocks were on monday october 15 2007 at 6 32 in the morning I havent wanted to report these because I was tresspassing and I never really knew how to. ,Middleburg ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12019,yes
1112,At about 9 30 at night  I was back in an area Near Lake Asbury where there is a Church camp in the woods. It was dark  but there was enough light to see what I saw. It was about 8   tall  and was running straight across from me about 50   away. It was covered with black  shaggy hair. Its head was kind of dome-like  and its shoulders were very big. It appeared to be trotting  and its shoulders twisted back and forth as it ran  but its arms hung straight down at its sides  not pumping back and forth like a human  s would. Its arms hung down nearly to its knees. I saw it and watched it for about 7 seconds. I started shaking  because we had talked about this creature in class  and I immediately knew what I had seen. About a minute later  I smelled this horrible smell that smelled like a wet  nasty pig pen after a rain (we have pigs so I  m sure of the smell). About 5 minutes later I heard some hooting noises. They were quite loud  and there were about 3 hoots one after another  then a pause of about 2 seconds  then about 3-4 more hoots. It sounded similar to some of the Bigfoot sounds  hoots  we listened to in my Biology class  but they were longer. ,It is off of a county road (739)  just NE. of Middleburg  Fl. ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12019,yes
1113,A couple of years ago  my best friend at the time and I were just hiking through the woods like we typically did back then. We weren  t making a lot of noise  but we were joking around as usual and laughing a little bit  and not really paying attention to our surroundings. We were originally planning on visiting a spot where several large  thick blue berry bushes grew to pick some of the berries  until we rounded a corner to the right in the trail. Approximately forty or fifty yards away  I noticed a loomering figure. It was tall  black  and had thick fur that appeared to be semi-long and coarse. It wasn  t facing us and due to the height of the bushes and palmettos  a lower half the body wasn  t visible to our eyes. My guess at it  s height is somewhere between six and seven feet tall at the top of its head. The creature was moving away from us and though I don  t recollect any noise ( I  m assuming I was far too frightening to remember it  because only seconds after seeing it  we ran )  but my best friend  who was standing directly at my side  claims she heard it moving through the foliage and creating quite a bit of sound such as breaking twigs  branches  and leaves rustling. We were genuinely freaked out and ran from the area as soon as we managed to regain ourselves and our bearings  which couldn  t have been any longer than thirty seconds or so. ,N/A. ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12019,yes
1114,Hiking through the woods this morning with my younger brother after visiting a creek  we were halted on the trail by a series of loud whacks at approximately 11 30 am. It didn  t sound metallic; it was very much like wood-on-wood  with a duration of three or four seconds between each whack  which I counted at three. Instantly  I was reminded of wood knocks. What we heard next  perhaps a minute and a half to two minutes following the last knock  made me jump. It was a cry. A loud  long  drawn out type cry that I cannot associate with any other animal. It wasn  t a cow. It wasn  t a bear. It wasn  t a bird of any kind that I know of. And it most definitely was NOT canine. It lasted about six to eight seconds It had to have been within a mile of where we were standing. We were yards away from the creek. ,Nearest paved road is  in Middleburg. ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12019,no
1115,This report was written by me  investigator David Wright  on behalf of a young witness  who was in my presence  answering questions  when this report was documented. Two teenage boys  ages 15 and 16 were going into the woods to play paintball. They dropped off their bikes at a bridge that goes over this creek and started into the woods. Just as they entered the woods  they saw something moving and making noise in front of them and saw this gigantic  upright black creature  run across the trail in front of them.  They saw it for about 5 seconds. It looked at them as it ran  and when it saw them  it accelerated and ran up a 5   steep drop and disappeared into the woods. They both thought it was a very tall  naked dark human being. That  s all they could think of to interpret what they saw. ,This was near the first bridge on 215 after it branches off of Hwy. 21 south  Blanding Blvd. ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12019,yes

1118,Me and a friend were coming back from indian ford park in jennings state forest by hattie nolan road. As we were walking back to my house we saw it standing approximatly 40 yds away. It stood at least 7 ft it looked like i would come up to his head. Our first instinct was to run. After days of keeping silent I talked to my teacher Mr.David Wright. who is a part of the bfro. I told him about our incident and he handled the situation professional. A few days later Mr. wright and i then went to site where it happened and he took photos of twisted trees that littered the place.Then as we were walking back he performed one of their calls and with in seconds we got a reply.We tried it 3 more times and got responses from different directions.And the really weird thing was that ive never heard an animal sound like that ,keep going straight of bronco about 30 minutes and turn right at a fork and keep going till you pass a creek ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12019,no

1121,While archeery hunting in the Camp Blanding WMA Block C I heard a loud growling grunting sound as  I was walking on Sapp road toward my truck . I was about 300 yds from county route 100 when I heard the noise. It was unlike any animal sound  I have ever heard. I have been a hunter and outdoorsman since my youth so for about 40 yearsI have been hunting from Pa. to florida and never experienced any thing like this  . I have heard Bobcats and hogs  but this was very different than thooses type of vocalizations ,This occured in the archery only area of camp Blanding in C Block About 300 yds from the gate on Sapp rd. ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12019,no
1122,I was out hunting small game in Camp Blanding on the still hunt side close to Cemetary Road I had a friend of mine about 150 yards to my right and about 30-40 yards in front.I saw something running between us going from my right to in front of me it was between the two of us.It stopped about 50-60 yards in front of me and turned and looked at me I stood looking trying to figure out what I was seeing for maybe 30 seconds I then got down on one knee and watched about 45 seconds it turned to its right my left and was gone.It was a dark brown allmost black running kinda like an old man that had back problems bent over a little at the waist.It was on two legs not four as all other animals in the woods have.I could see the arms moving as it ran just as a man  s would when he is running.I am 6 foot tall I walked to the spot I saw it loooking  at the tree it was beside and was looking to see if I could tell how tall it was.From what I could tell from what I saw it stood about 7 foot tall.I looked for any tracks found none as it was a swamp nothing but water but you could see evidence that something was there from the way the grass in the water was laid over.I called to my friend asked if he saw anything he said no.We both started walking hunting more all the while I was thinking about what I saw.We walked approx. 1/2 mile from where I saw whatever it was and he saw a VERY large pile of feces on the ground we both looked at it for a while poking at it with sticks trying to figure out what kind of animal it could have come from.We both have hunted for over 35 years each and have never seen anything like this.We saw alot of grassy materials and alot of berries in it.No hair bones or anything that you  would see from most carnivores in the woods. ,Hwy 21 south to Dade Road in Camp Blanding right on Cemetary Rd to Wilson Rd approx  300  yards on the right then approx.500 yards into the woods. ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12019,yes
1123,A friend and I had been on Black creek in Clay county for a few hours bass fishing with absolutely no luck.  Working the last stretch of bank before we called it a day when I heard something walking in the woods.  I could hear large footsteps and something that sounded like it was scooping water or slapping water  I really can  t describe the sound. Now I know this particular area and the wildlife that inhabits it pretty well I think  It is full of deer  wild boar  turkeys  a few black bears  and the rest of the small woodland critters.  And this sound was way too large to be any of them. Back to my story  after we heard the noise I motioned to my friend to be silent so I could trolling motor over to the bank so I could try to get a look.  As we were silently getting closer it seemed like the creature must have noticed us because we stuck out like a sore thumb against the back drop of the creek  while it stayed perfectly camoflauged in the wood.  We sat there for a few moments hoping it would move and reveal itself to us which it never did. So  as the sun was dropping we had to get back to the boat ramp  we quitely circled away from the shore.  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat. It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore.  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up  and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride. Jokingly we said we had just encountered a sasquatch just like every other time I heard something unusual on that body of water.  But as we made our way back to the dock I noticed we were within half a mile from powerlines.  And were within a mile of the county dump that I know for a fact is a popular spot with the local whitetail deer population. ,250 yards west of the train tressel on the north bank.  Only access is by boat or to walk the tracks  which is highly illegal. ,Clay,22,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12019,yes
1124,As a member of Carpenters Union #1641 out of Naples  Florida  I was offered work disassembling a house in Ochopee. Our crew of about 8 men arrived very early  before the trucks  so we climbed up to the roof to enjoy the sunrise and the view. A couple of us were munching on sandwiches  or sipping sodas. On the way up to the roof  some of us noted a foul smell emanating from the basement  As all of the lower windows were broken  we assumed an animal had crawled in there to die. Suddenly  one of the guys at the edge yelled for us to look below him. We all came to the roof edge and observed a tall  hairy creature leaving the basement of the house and walking upright towards the edge of the trees  directly away from us. As soon as the creature reached the tree line  it turned and squated facing us on the roof  about 40 yards away. The creature was about six feet tall  with reddish-brown hair all over it  s body. It made no noise or other movement. This silent standoff continued until the creature suddenly stood and gazed far off to the west. It had heard our trucks arriving before we could even see them from the roof. The creature turned and had totally disappeared within just a few steps away from us. Although we were looking down from a height in full daylight  it was just gone. Later  we examined the basement and noticed a sleeping area under the stairs. It was composed of old clothes  rags  weeds and animal fur. There was a nasty smell and we left this spot alone as we took down the entire house  which was moved in pieces to the Gainsville area. ,This house stood alone at the time. I don  t recall any other homes near by. There would be nothing left now but the basement foundation  unless someone else built there later. ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12021,yes
1125,I was hunting hogs by myself and had been in this area for about 3 hours. I was armed with a Remington model 1100 12ga. shotgun. I was walking between two large Cypress Bayheads in a sawgrass field that was approximately 500 yds. wide by 1/4 mile long. I was looking down at the ground searching for hog tracks. I had seen a group of about 8 hogs approximately 45 minutes earlier  and was trying to outflank them. I looked up to see how close I was to the Bayhead  when I saw  what at first was just a dark object at the edge of the bayhead. My first thought was that it was a bear. I crouched down and started to advance in order to see it better  and  maybe get a shot at it. When I was approximately 80 to 100 yards away  it stood up on two feet. I froze solid  inside and out! What I saw was NO BEAR! It  s back was to me at first  but after about five seconds  it turned to face me. It was dark brown to black in color  stood approximately 6 1/2ft. high and was VERY solidly built. I got the height by looking at vegetation where it had stood after the encounter was over. I was able to view the creature for approximately 10 to 15 seconds before it turned and went into the bayhead. I think it took me five to ten minutes just to get my heart rate and breathing back to normal. I forgot all about the shotgun I was carrying! When I approached the area where it had been  I detected a foul odor lingering in the air. It was like something had soured. The grass was bent down  but there was no bare dirt from which to detect a track. I DID NOT follow it into the bayhead! I have told only my wife and father of this incident. I had heard  from time to time  about Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest  but this was the farthest thing from my mind that day. There is a creature in that swamp that is not a bear  not a human. I can  t really say what it is  but I know it exists. ,The area was in a sawgrass field between two cypress bayheads. It was about 500 yards wide by 1/4 mile in length. ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12021,yes
1126,Immokalee Florida 1987 - My family and I were in having an evening of fun when we heard a horrible noise coming from the direction of where our dog was outside. My husband went out to investigate because our dog sounded as if were scarred or being hurt. When my husband got to our shed he saw a large shadow up against the siding and it sounded as if our dog were being muffled. He ran back into our home thinking it was a bear or something to the effect and grabbed his gun. He then went back outside ( us trailing close behind him) and it appeared to him as if something were running down our driveway - in the meantime our dog was hidding underneath our home. My husband fired a couple of shots towards the area he thought this creature or animal was and we heard a very loud growl howl type noise  after that it got deathly quiet. I will never forget the chills that ran up me when I heard theses sounds.The next morning we did check the area and we did find weird type footprints that looked not like human nor were they a bear or any other type of animal that I am familar with. Whatever it was it was able to make a leap from the street and across a canal and land on it  s feet. The only thing that we can figure is that during the day we had taken our family fishing in the grove and we were followed back by what I honestly believe to be a bigfoot. Our home sat on a hill that when our porch light is on it can be seen from within the surrounding woods - we checked this - I believe it followed the lighting as it knew there was something there. We later found out that the people who occupied our home before us had an encounter with the backdoor being ripped off it  s hinges. They assumed it was a burglary while away. We now suspect not. We were told also through my husbands supervisor that several sightings had occured not only in the area but at Lake trafford as well. Lake Trafford was less than 5 miles from where we were living at the time. I will never forget my experience with this night. I thank God my chldren were sleeping but unfortunately my younger brother was not - he was 10 at the time and I remember him being so very frightened and crying. He still remembers that night. Every since I have wanted to find proof of what we heard and to prove to myself that it was real. I am a believer! ,about 5 miles from Lake Trafford in Immokalee Florida ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12021,no
1127,Several months after Hurricane Andrew struck south Florida  five friends and myself were on a hog hunting trip in an area just south east of the Big Cypress Indian Reservation. My friends had a camp there  along with other people who had been there for years. This area is a weekend get away spot were people go to hunt and camp. The area is very swampy and filled with many oak and cabbage palm hammocks and cypress heads. To get around the terrain you must have a four wheel drive swamp buggy with good clearance. On this particular day we had drove many hours in search of hog tracks. We used dogs to sniff out the hogs  by driving on the swamp buggy trails. I had noticed a certain trail that had not been used for quit some time and no visible buggy tracks. I came up to a big puddle in the road and notice that the animals in the area had been using it to drink from. I saw hog tracks  deer  turkey  raccons  birds. Noticing the hog tracks I drove completely around the pool of water to save this a as a marker to return later in the evening. Around midnight we drove two buggies into the area that I suspected hogs would be hiding from the midday sun. We drove all night crashing down palmetto bushes that had grown up in this area on the trails.  During this time no other human sign had been observed until the next day. At the pool of water where I saw the animal sign I returned and found some strange tracks. I appeared to be human shaped  bipedal. One was very big and the other very small like a child  s or possibly deformed. The tracks had a stride of approximately six feet  with a depth of two to three inches . I tried to imitate the step and stride and could not. I would fall over and barely broke the surface of the mud a half inch. When I stomped my foot into the mud I still could not reach the depth of the suspicious tracks. I went back to the camp and told my friends what I had found. We then returned to the location later that evening and to my amazement new tracks were found. The  maker of the tracks had returned after my departure. It may be noted that myself and friends are veteran law enforcement officers who have seen it  done it and got a T-shirt . We don  t believe what we hear and half of what we see. At this point we were very suspicious and concerned about what we had stirred up out of the swamp the night before. We had a 8 mm vhs camera and video taped the tracks and the comparison of our tracks. Three out of five of us believed that we had found the tracks of an escaped gorilla   being that the hurricane had damaged the Miami zoo and reports of escaped monkeys had been reported. Or the tracks of a skunk ape.  Being police officers you don  t run back to town and tell everyone that you saw skunk ape tracks while on a vacation. We left the area in amazement and discussed the possibilities of it being a skunk ape. While riding back to camp approximately 3 miles from the suspicious track location on a hard dry road bed we found another set of tracks.  The track impressions were as deep as the ones found near the mud. At this time we were convinced that no human had made these tracks because of the lack of other vehicle tracks and the fact that someone walking 3 miles barefoot in this terrain with one bad foot was unlikely. We video taped this track spot as well. Upon returning home a couple of us were convinced that this needed further investigation.  I spoke with some of the old timers that had hunted this part of the country and they laughed about my tale.   Later in the spring I returned to the area to try to locate the tracks again so that I could take casts and photos if I found anything. The area was like what I had found prior to driving in the swamp months earlier  no tire tracks just the local inhabitants  hogs  deer  turkey. These woods are thick and I do believe that an intelligent creature could sneak around undetected from civilized man. The land is rich with food and shelter. I have moved away from my home in the Glades and often wonder if I had scared a skunk ape from his hiding spot in that pristine oak hammock during the fall of 1993 or was it a prankster. We never told anyone out side our circle of friends and never read about mysterious tracks found in the Everglades and or spoke with anyone down there that might have seen the same tracks. I guess it will! be my own little my life  s mystery. ,South Florida  Everglades  near the area of the Dade County and Collier County line  between Big Cypress and Alligator Alley ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12021,no

Goodbread and the tourists observed a large brownish colored creature behind some brush near the bridge. The creature continually stood upright on two legs  was approximately 7   tall  had hair covering it  s entire body (except for the face) and was rocking back & forth.  Goodbread advised that the creature resembled a gorilla. Goodbread indicated that the creature was shaking the bushes and appeared to be irritated by their presence. The creature was approximately 70 to 80 yards away. Goodbread continued to watch the creature for about 15 minutes.  Goodbread repeatedly eased the tour bus forward and backward so as to allow visibility  of the creature  to everyone on the bus. Goodbread attempted to get one of the tourist  with a telephoto lens on her camera  to exit the bus and take photographs of the creature. No on would get off the bus. Goodbread now feels that exiting the bus might have been a bad idea. Goodbread finally drove away  leaving the creature at this location.  Goodbread later returned to the area and found a road where he could drive into the swamp. Goodbread did not locate the creature again. Goodbread feels that the creature might have been a hoax but states that it would be nearly impossibly for a human to withstand the heat  at that time of day  in a suit. This is also an area that is heavily populated by alligators. Goodbread states that they have been observing a large number of  deer and hogs moving out of the swamp because of the high water. Goodbread feels that he is in a little disbelief of what he saw  although  he believes in the possible existence of the skunk ape  and prefers not to associate the creature with his tours. Dow Roland is a tour guide for Everglades Day Safari. Rowland was driving a tour bus on Friday 7-18-97  around 2 30 pm   with a group of tourist  along Turner Road. Roland observed a brownish colored bipedal creature about 300   west of the  road  at the edge of the brush. Roland described the creature as being  approximately 7   tall  long brown hair  standing upright when walking or  running  having a smooth face and resembling a gorilla.  Rowland  s observation  of the creature  was brief before it ran into the brush. Rowland  s initial thought was that it was someone in a gorilla suit playing a prank.  Rowland was on his return trip at the time of this sighting.  A few minutes later Rowland returned to the same area  on Turner Road  with another group of tourists. Rowland was near the area where he had first observed the creature. Rowland again observed the creature on the west side of Turner road. This time the creature was approximately 150   from the road and again the observation was brief before the creature ran into the brush. The creature appeared to act  nervous. Rowland believed this to be the same creature that he had previously observed. Rowland indicates that he was still shocked and  in disbelief that this could be a real creature. Rowland finished the tour without observing the creature again.  After completing the tour  Rowland retrieved his camera and returned to the area on Turner Road. Rowland drove up & down Turner Road but was unable to locate the creature. Rowland was driving south near the area of his other sightings  preparing to give up his search  when he observed a white convertible driving north. The convertible passed him and continued north bound.  Rowland looked in his rear view mirror and observed the convertible stop suddenly then drive off. In an instant Rowland observed the creature appear at the west edge of Turner Road  approximately where the convertible had stopped. Rowland turned around but the creature had again disappeared into the brush. Rowland was unable to locate the creature again. The next day  on Saturday 7-19-97  Rowland told David Shealy of  his observations. David Shealy is the owner/operator of the Florida Panther Gift Shop located on Highway U. S. 41 one mile west of Turner Road. Jan Brock is a Collier county realtor who lives in the area of Ochopee   Florida.  On the morning of Monday 7-21-97 Brock was traveling south on Burns road  sometime just prior to 7 45 am  in route to work.  Brock traveled through this location just prior to Vince Doerr.  Brock was approximately 2 miles north of U. S. 41 when she observed a creature  that she indicated was approximately 1000 feet in front of her car  cross the road.  Brock first observed the creature at the west edge of the road.  The creature crossed the road  heading east  and disappeared into the thick brush and trees on the east side of Burns road.  Brock described the creature as about 7   tall  covered with a furry coat of thick dark brown hair and what appeared to be a patch of off-white or light colored hair on it  s chest. Brock explained that she has often times traveled the roads  observed the wildlife  and has seen numerous animals in the Everglades.  Brock compared the light colored chest patch  on the creature  to similar coloration that she has observed on bears that have been laying on the local limestone roads.  Brock further explained that this creature was definitely not a bear  that it  s legs were too long to be a bear and that it walked upright the entire time of her observation. Brock recalls that she noticed that the creature looked in her direction but she was too far away to view the physical characteristics of any facial features.  Brock drove to the location  where the creature had crossed  and stopped her car.   Brock rolled her window down part way but did not exit her vehicle.  Brock looked around for the creature and for signs of any footprints.  Brock was unable to observe any further signs of the creature.  Brock commented that she had heard of the pungent odor  reportedly emitted by the Florida skunk ape  but she did not smell anything abnormal.  Brock drove on to work without any other sightings.  Brock  s family has owned property  in this area  for many years.  Brock used to bring her children  when they were young & before they built a house there  to the area for picnics and weekend camping trips.  This would have been in the late 1960s.  Brock explained that her children would often claim that they saw a bigfoot creatures around their property and in the swamps.  Brock advised that her family has never been bothered by the creatures.  Brock does believe that the creatures exist and does not fear them. On  7-21-97  Vince Doerr  driving south from his home toward U.S. highway 41 in route to work  observed a Skunk Ape cross the road approximately 600   to 800   in front of him. The creature was moving from east to west at a slow pace. The witness arrived at the crossing sight  exited his vehicle and took a photograph  of the creature  approximately 80 yards away in the swamp. The picture is of the rear and upper torso of the creature. The creature was approximately 7   tall  bulky  reddish dark brown in color and continuously walked upright.  This photo is not entirely clear  the alleged creature is circled in the center of the photo.  In the future the BFRO will be doing enhancements on the photo  we will update the report when the enhancements are complete.   David Shealy learned of fire chief Vince Doerr  s sighting  and associated it with what Dow Roland had told him earlier.  On Thursday 7-24-97 Shealy went to the area  on Turner Road  where the creature had been observed. Shealy is a long time resident of the area and is familiar with the swamp. Shealy began searching the area.  He found  what he believed to be  hair on some brush. The brush was along side a path. The hair was brown  in color and approximately three inches in length. The hair was later lost. (The information can be explained by the researcher.) Shealy located several large tracks in the area. Shealy was able to take plaster casts of two of the tracks. The footprints measured  approximately 13.5 in length  approximately 6"" in width at the toes and approximately 3"" in width at the heel. (The researcher  in this case  has examined and photographed the plaster casts.) A couple (names confidential) was out watching birds and wildlife when it began to get dark. The couple prepared to leave the area and turned on their headlights. They were traveling north on Turner road when they observed a creature cross the road approximately 100 to 200 yards in front of them... They drove to the area of the crossing and turned their vehicle towards the west side of the road  in the direction that the creature had traveled.. As they turned their car  the headlights caught an object about 30 yards from the west side of Turner road. As the couple looked closer  they realized that it was a very dark complexioned man-like creature that they described as being well over 7   tall  300 to 400 pounds and looking like a linebacker for a football team.... The creature constantly kept it  s back to the vehicle and moved out of the headlights... As the couple moved the car  to place the creature back in the headlights  it again moved out of the light... The couple became concerned and left the area... When the couple were asked about further details  of the creature  they advised that they never saw the face and were unable to advise as to body hair.  The couple reported this information to a local wildlife naturalist and tracker... The couple refused to give their names or any contact information  advising that they did not want to be harassed.

1129,We( me and a friend ) went night fishing for catfish   actually getting to a muddy   run-off right off st rd 41 around 10pm during the summer of 1997 near turner road. As we off loaded our equipment and cleared the overpass rails we headed down the side of the overpass; we were shining flashlights around the pond  to make sure we didn  t step on any snakes or gators  something screamed at us (now mind you that there was only about 2 to 3 feet of space between the pond and dense woods i can  t imagine how something can even get in there)  with such intensity that i felt my chest rattle my heart almost stopped; it felt like whatever this was was right in front of us and it did not want us there!! we are not  amateurs we both were carrying high powered hand guns  and could not locate what this creature was or where it was yet it felt like it was right in front of us. we scanned the area over and over but to our surpised could not locate where or what this sound came from all we knew was that it was BIG!! well we hightailed it out of there and could never understand what could have that kind of vocal power until i started my own research online. Me and my friend have been fishing in the glades for over 25 years and have much experience  with wildlife   bors gators  deers black bear  i  ve even seen panthers and have done a some tracking  i have found footprints that just don  t add up; bare human shaped prints in the middle of a cypress swamp  i  ve seen what looked like a urangutan in the swamp looking at us from behind trees and disappearing and me my friend would always ( this type of sighting twice)  jokingly state that someone  s pet had gotten away.  we never been bothered other then that night this creature screamed at us and we took it as it did  n  t wan  t us there i felt we disturbed something  invaded it  s territory  i hope this helps for after i started my own research i came to the conclusion that these creatures do exist call it what you want (bigfoot  skunkape  sasquatch) they are real and they don  t bother us except when we invade their space . I really enjoy your website it also helps me understand that i  m  not crazy   most people would  think and look at me like i  m crazy  when i relatemy encounter  (they don  t have any experience outside of the city  they will never understand until  bigfoot hits them over the head  even then they  d deny it. These creatures have a right to be there good luck ,SR41 near 40 mile bend ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12021,no
1130,In march of 2001 There was about 5-7 guys on a camping& fishing trip in the everglades national park.We were camping at a romote campsite in the park called the  Watson Place  on the chatham river. The campsite is about 3-4 miles up river from the mouth that meets the gulf. The campsite is on an old shell mound that the indians used to call  Bad Land .The site is only accessed by boat and it takes about an hour to get to the site from the nearest ramp in chokoloskee. The national park butts up to Big Cypress Preserve. The weather was dry & cool. One of the nights five of the guys decided to do some night fishing in the backbays of the everglades They left the camp and you could hear their motors running for miles back in the bays. They had been gone since about 2- hours when the other person at the camp turned in for the night. I was fishing off the bank relaxing & waiting for the guys to get back.It had been about an hour since the other person turned in.It was around 11 30 at night when I heard the most piercing scream I have ever heard in my life!.....It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up stand up!!! I have heard panthers scream and bobcats and this was a more high pitched sound!I was turning all the lamps on in camp whem about 30 seconds after the first scream  I heard a second. same exact sound. I estimated the sounds to be about 75-100 yards. I thought to myself   this cannot be a person  I would have heard their boat coming from miles away and the island is filled with razor sharp mangroves with oysters & barnicles all along the banks The only place to get off is the campsite. I did not hear anymore screams that night! About 20-30 minutes later I heard my buddy s motors coming in the distance. When they got to camp I told them about what I heard and not one of them laughed or did not take me seriously. The landscape is Mangrove islands with lots of shallow bays.Florida has been in a drought for years and the everglades have been real dry in the interior. ,The national park service will give you information to the watson place. ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12021,no
1131,I was headed west down the easement road off Turner road. I came around a turn and saw what I assumed was a monkey or an ape. It sat on all fours with its rear end down and its front end higher  kind of like a gorilla. It ran  then stopped and looked at me for a few seconds  then ran away. It ran in the same manner it was setting  on all fours with the front end highest. It never stood on its hind legs. The rear legs definitely seemed shorter than the front. It was dark brown in color and covered in hair. The hair seemed to be short. On all fours it stood about 21/2 or three feet tall. ,Off Turner Road  east side. ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12021,yes
1132,In may of 1973 I and my father were working for XXXXX XXXXXX Drywall in Boynton Beach  Florida. We had just finished a job and came into the office for a new assignment. Frank told us he had a  special job  and would consider it a favor if we did it. The developer of Boca Teeca had a couple of hunting cottages  in the everglades  and it wouldn  t take us more than a couple of days. We would have to camp over since it was too far to drive and there wasn  t any lodging around. Now my wife was over 7 months pregnant and I wasn  t crazy about doing the job. However  Frank was persausive   If you want to continue working for me you  ll do it!  I didn  t have health insurance and was making payments to Bethesda Hospital  in advance  for my wife  s upcoming hospital stay. So I caved in and took the job. The next day we packed some camping gear in the station wagon. My idea of camping was a state park or KOA camp. We set off. The directions were simple  take the Florida Turnpike south and go west on Alligator Alley  about halfway across you will see a gravel road to the left. Pass it and take the next gravel road to the left. The work site would be halfway between Alligator Alley and the Tamiami Trail. Looking back I would say this would have put it in Collier County  Florida (the beginning of everglades country). We taveled miles and miles  under the hot sun  on Alligator Alley  for what seemed miles and miles of miles and miles. Coming to the second gravel road we turned left and traveled more miles and miles down a washboard gravel road. I had packed fishing gear and a .22 cal. magnum pistal (with holster) and two .30 cal.M1 carbines. A canal ran parralel to road and I had at least wanted to get my hook wet. I talked him into stopping for 15 mins. or so (to stretch our legs) and I dropped a line in the canal. It was full of alligator gar which were stacked up like cord wood. My father spotted a water moccasin on the other bank and I took my .22 mag  aimed behind the head  shot and took its head clean off. We started up again and after many more miles saw a sign   XXX XXXXX Site.  We arrived in the early afternoon. The two cottages turned out to be two houses. Each identical and 2 stories high. The developers had a drive made by dumping a pad of coarse gravel  about 2.5 to 3 feet high  about 300 yeards back into the swamp. At the end  and right  of each drive was a big square of gravel the houses were built on. This was going to be more than a 2 day job. We started taping the houses. While I was working I could hear something rummaging around out in the bush. I couldn  t see anything but there was a strong odor similar to the pig farm next to my grandfather  s farm (in Ohio). XXXXX XXXXXX had a reputation as being a boar hunter and I assumed it was a boar. We worked till dark and cleaned and packed up our tools. I had Dad start a camp fire on the part of the drive that went past the house (you had to do a 3 point turn in the car port area to turn around). I set up the cots and put on my holster and .22 mag revolver (just in case we encountered a charging boar). Dad brougt a slab of bacon (his idea of camp food). Oh well  he was doing the cooking. It smelled good too. One thing about Dad  he  s  a master chef when it comes to ruff grub. We ate bacon and beans and home fries and then sat around the fire talking. The whole time I kept hearing the rummaging around in the everglades. The sound seemed to be getting nearer. It occurred to me if it were a wild boar  or anthing as larges as the sounds indicated  the .22 mag probably wouldn  t be too effective. I decided to go get one of the carbines. As I stood up and started to go to the wagon I turned and saw two eyes staring from about 20 foot away. First thougt... an owl. But then I realized what I was looking at. I froze in my tracks. Next thought a bear. Only I was staring level in its eyes. I was on a gravel pad about 2.5 to 3 foot higher than it was. I am 5 foot 6 inches. My God... it was 8 to 9 foot tall. My hand went for my gun. I drew it and was going to fire. Only I realized if I shot this thing all I was going to do was really piss it off. Also  it wasn  t acting threatening. It was just watching. It had a face more human than a bear or ape. Closer to an Australian aborriginal. I could also see its skin. It didn  t have thick fur. It had sparse  long and whispy like strands. The hair was more like an orangutan. Only these were things I put together later. At the time I was just plain scared. As a Viet Nam verteran  with a purple heart  I wasn  t overscared either. Let just say I had a strong sense of self preservation. I made a bee line for the house and momentarilly thought about stopping to get the carbine from the wagon. However  my feet took me into the house and up the stairwell. My Dad was hot on my heels. I went to the window which faced the camp fire. As I looked out the window I asked Dad  who was across the room   Did you see that?  He said   No.  I told him   then what the heck were you running for?  He said   I saw you draw your gun  then didn  t shoot and then run off. I figured you had a good reason.  I told him   we need the carbines. You go out and get them and I will cover you.  He wouldn  t do it. Still looking out the window I noticed we left the slab of bacon on a log near the camp fire. Then I saw it come out of the brush. I told Dad   There it is. Come over here and look at it.  He woudln  t do it. I don  t know if he could have got across the room in time any way. It crossed the viewable area  may 100 ft. in a few strides. As it walked it scooped up the slab of bacon. It didn  t really bend over. It just dropped a shoulder slightly. It was walking upright the whole time. I might add it was walking  not running. It was casually strolling as if it didn  t have a care in the world. It dawned on me that it didn  t mean any harm. It justed wanted the bacon. Anyway I went to the wagon and got the carbines. Even though I wasn  t sure what I saw and I concluded it didn  t mean any harm I wasn  t taking any chances. I told Dad we were going to take two hour watches. He decided to sleep first. I woke him up in two hours and told him to awaken me in two hours. I woke up in the morning and he was fast asleep. Whatever it was could have had us. If it had wanted to. The doors had not been installed yet. I went out and looked for tracks. Nothing on the gravel. I didn  t expect any. I climbed down to the ground. I thought it would be soft. It was dry and there was a thick pad of pine needles. There were a few scruffed places but the distance between them looked too far apart to be foot steps. I thought about venturing out and looking for a soft spot but at the time I wasn  t trying to prove anything but to myself. If my Dad wasn  t such a chicken  and had seen it  then I would have been more resolved to look further. Only now I was beginning to wonder if I had imagined the whole thing. I really didn  t make the connection until a few weeks after I came home and there was a newspaper article about Sasquatch sightings in the area I had been in. I just made a mental note to ask if any circus or zoo animals had escaped  in that area  and if so I would call and tell them what I saw. I am not relating this encounter to make you a true believer. At that time I know I saw something and this is a report on what I thought I saw. After 28 years I now question it myself. The more time that passes the sketchier the recollection is. I only offer this record in hopes it might help those who are seriously looking for it. I have one reservation. If this creature is real  and is it found  will that doom it to extinction? ,I believe Alligator Alley is now called I-75. I haven  t been back there since. ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12021,yes
1133,I was camping with family in the big cypress area near alligator alley april week of the 15th. I saw what i thought was a black shadow standing 8ft tall in the woods in front of me. I told my friend and turned my head. A few minutes later looked again and that black thing was gone and i was able to see through the forest. I shook the feeling off then that night is where it began. That night for dinner we cooked chicken legs and turkey meatballs over the fire. My brother left the garbage bag hanging 10 feet away from us and we went to bed. 4am I awoke hearing this strange sound in the far distance sounding 3 miles away. The sound came closer and closer to the point i knew it was heading towards my campsite. I woke up my ex-boyfriend  then my brother in another tent. I said do you hear that sound? they said yes be quiet. The sound was a wailing sound with a heavy breath at the end. I thought it was an alien and my ex thought it was a monster. The sound was horrible  and it got closer and closer to the camp. I heard it go by my tent and head in the direction of my brothers to the side of it  then left and went down a trail path behind our tents. I got up and wanted to look out of the tent window but my ex grabbed me and said are you crazy. The next morning we woke up and talked about it and began to trace the direction where the monster walked. I looked down and found a footprint in the sandy trail it looked like a huge foot both wide and long. Both guys put their foot in the print and it was way bigger than their foot in width and length couldnt be a persons foot. It looked like 4 big toes. This wasn  t there the day before. We went up the trail and saw a few more of the prints. When we went home a guy friend of my cousins was interested in this phenomena so i went back with him and showed him where it occured and the footprint but it had slightly been messed up. He took picture but it didn  t come out good. I wanted to go back again that year but my ex  brother  and cousin said no way. my cousin said she would have to bring a gun if she ever did go back. This strange happening scared them to death. I did go back with my kids and we were fine  no noises heard that night. I heard on the computer the noises of the skunk ape since the guy told me to listen and i couldn  t believe it  it sounded a lot like what we had heard at the campsite. Hope you enjoyed the true story i just told you. I will be visiting it again sometime soon  i would rather not give the direct area since i don  t want it to sell out when i need to camp. The location i gave was correct but it is a long radius. Bye  Meg ,I already included in my story. ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12021,no
1134,We were driving eastbound on US 41 to go fishing off of Turner River Rd. about 11 AM. at approx. 1/2 a mile east of the I 29 and US 41 intersection.  My girlfriend looked to the north side of the road and said  Jerry  I think I see something.   I looked immediately and saw the creature turn approx. 90 degrees take 3 steps and kneel straight down into the grass like a human would.  Judging by the height of the grass  we guessed it was about 8 feet tall and by the size of the torso it weighed probably around 400 pounds.  The creature was about 50 yards north of US 41.  The whole sighting lasted around 10 seconds considering we were driving around 60 mph. , ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12021,yes
1135,I currently have a job as a test driver and i spend a lot of time driving on alligator alley (I-75 between Naples and Ft. Lauderdale) and on many of the other roads out in the everglades. One about 2 weeks ago I was driving east along alligator alley when something got my attention out of the corner of my eye. Off to the right side of the road I saw what appeared to be a hairy animal standing about 6 ft. tall  it appeared to be standing in a clearing about 20 ft. south of the canal that follows the roadway. Although it was only a quick sighting I am pretty confident in what I saw  later that day when driving by the same spot I tried to see if there was anything static in the clearing that could be mistaken for a creature and I couldn  t find anything. ,It was in a clearing just south of the highway. It was behind a canal and a fence that lines the highway so access would probably tricky. ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12021,yes

1137,I was at a conference in Miami and I decided to take a hike in the big cypress preserve.  After a couple hours of hiking and on my way back I found a track.  That  s when everything changed and my energy level went way up. It was off to the side of the old road or trail I was on. Looked like it probably been made after the water covering the road at one time had receded. I circled the track  going farther out each time looking for more. I got my camera and a measuring tape. It measured about 14  long and 6  wide and was probably about a week or two old. About 1 inch deep.  Still holding its shape I could make out the outline of four toes. As I was measuring and taking photos I found myself looking over my shoulder every couple of minutes. ,North of 41 ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12021,yes
1138,Found 2 separate strange tracks a mile from one another. One track seemed to show an abducted ape-like toe. The other track seemed have left toe-prints that were unusually splayed out as oppose to a human print. ,[Editor  s note  The location details have been removed from this public posting because a BFRO expedition headed to this area in Feb. 2008.

1139,On the early morning of labor day a few of my friends and I decided that we would drive across the state of Florida  from Miami to Naples in hopes of surfing some of the swell that Hurricane Gustav was sending to Florida  s Gulf Coast. At approximately 6 00A.M we left from Florida International University traveling west on the Tamiami Trail. The weather that day was relatively clear but as I mentioned we had a hurricane passing close to south Florida a few days earlier so everything was still quite humid and the winds were beginning to calm down at about 15 knots to the west. It was near the area of big cypress about 15 minutes from the worlds smallest post office  where the landscape had plenty of saw grass in shallow water and large trees at a distance of about a mile off the road where I saw a figure that seemed to be watching the road as we drove past. This creature was definitely not a person. I know that it was not a person because we had only seen about 5 cars in the entire length of the trip thus far. Whatever it was  it appeared to be large  at least the size of a person  but it was dark  with a wide body structure  and even from the distance at which I saw it (maybe 300-500 yards) it looked as if it was covered in hair. The creature was standing next to a palmetto  and we passed it quite quickly. about 10 seconds after we passed it It came to my attention that I should probably tell my friend to turn the car around to see if I could get a better look. We stopped  drove back to the site  and It was gone. But as I got down from the car there was a very strange smell in the air that was nothing like I had ever smelled before  almost like a wet dog that had been covered in eggs. My guess was that maybe the creature had crossed the road  heard our car and checked us out  and that it realized that it did not like us so much and simply crouched down and hid. Nobody else in the car saw the creature  I was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side  the front seat passenger was asleep and the driver was simply concentrating on the road. I only saw this thing for a few seconds but it left quite an impression on me. Before this I thought that stories about Bigfoot were interesting but I would dismiss them saying that I would believe it when I would see it. But after seeing how remote this area was and how large the Everglades really are  I am now certain that there is a possibility that there is something out there.Thank you for responding to my report and feel free to give me a call at your convenience  if I do not pick up the phone it is probably because I am in class so leave me a message and I will contact you as soon as I can. Thanks David and let me know if there is anything else I can do.

1140,I have a sighting and other occurences to report. Its been about 3 years now since my friend Dan and I saw it. We were walking along a dirt/road trail along the focka canal system to find a good bass spot  as we were walking I thought I saw large brownish colored legs ahead on the trail. I didnt say anything at first until Dan asked me if I saw that. I was stunned and replied  Yea  Huge brown legs cross in front of us and he replied   I thought it was just my eyes . The sasquatch was in a group of trees next to the canal I guess checking us out. The reason I am saying this is because we heard and saw the branches in front of us russling. We were honestly scared and backed away slowly. Now Dan is a officer in the Navy now working I believe out of Miami. He is a very credible none bs type of person. I myself is a biologist and I am super observent of my surroundings. The only reason why we just saw the legs is because we were looking down in front of us so we didnt step on one of the resident water moccasins. Since then I have been going to the same location to try to see if  its  still there and yes  it  is. I havent seen it since the first time but I found an area off the trail that had almost like I guess beds?!? Basically it was long saw grass bundled up together and it was obvious something large has sat in it. Also near by I found skelatal remains and hair from a bear that seemed to literally have been ripped in half. I have also spent many nights fishing in the location and near it and have heard undeniable   calls  that seem like it came from some sort of primate. Similar to a very deep howler monkey call.  I have a lot of experience with primates from my studies throughout Latin America. Based on that I KNOW it was a primate call. There was another occurence when I was with my friend Chris on Turner River Rd. off Rt.41 South of Ochopee Fl. We were crawfish hunting after a evening shower and heard some odd noises in the woods across the canal system. Then we smelt a very odd odor I wouldnt say it smelt like rotten eggs like all the other reports but maybe like methane gas. We moved on about 2 miles down the road and was picking more crawfish out of the swamp and heard the same noises followed by the same smell. This occured for another 30 minutes or so and we felt uncomfortable and left. I believe I read that the BFRO went to Florida in 08 on an investigation and I believe it was off Rt.41? I think there is a few key locations that BFRO should check out  1. Picayune Strand  just outside of Naples  Fl  http //www.fl-dof.com/state_forests/picayune_strand.html  2. Turner River and Birdon Rds. just south of Ochopee  Fl off Rt. 41 http //www.staynplay.net/florida-tourism-articles/turner-river-road.htm I live in New Jersey but have a condo in Naples Fl  if BFRO wants to investigate these areas I believe I can find time to come down and show you the exact spots of the occurences. If you have any further questions please contact me I will be more then happy to answer any questions BFRO may have. Please take this seriously  my stories are not bogus  bs statements. I will take a polygraph test if need be. Please contact me back with your thoughts. ,Picayune Strand- From Naples Fl  Travel East down Immokalee Rd. turn right onto Randall Blvd follow road approx. 5 miles then turn right onto Everglades Blvd. Follow road approx. another 5 miles go over I-75 via a bridge into the strand turn left down the first street you see then follow road for about 1 mile and turn right down unknown dirt road and you will be at the sighting location.

1141,About this time 2 years ago  two of my friends and I were staying in my dads old trailer right off James Road  Naples Fl. It was around 9 30 p.m.  when we started hearing what sounded like wolf howls. The howling become a bit terrifying when we noticed it was getting closer. We then began howling back at it  when we realized we were caught right in between these things communicating. By this time it was already 11 00 p.m.  around this time small pebbles began being hurled at us from a distance. It reached such a freaky level when whatever was in the woods just 30 ft. from us was stomping and grunting at us. For some reason at some point we thought for sure it was a prank and began throwing pieces of wood and rocks  when all of a sudden a horrible silence came over us. With none of us wanting to admit we were freaking out  we suddenly mad dashed for the trailer and hid in my dad  s room (end of the trailer  pointing to the woods). Trying to play it off we tried sleeping huddled together like a can of sardines. We were overcome by tears and in a frozen like state. Knocking and grunting was all we heard for about an hour  until we gave our position in the trailer when my friend whispered to me to look out the window. For the final time a deep silence overcame outside. I slightly lifted one of the curtain blinds (not sure what their called  but there a series or levers that lift and tilt depending on how you pull or twist the small stick). When I looked out  not fearing due to the fact there were no lights on in the trailer  I saw nothing but what seemed to be my reflection in the glass  I thought I had confirmed it when I tilted my head and my supposed reflection did the same. When I released the blind and was asked what I saw  I told them it was my reflection. I waited about 4 minutes  in which seemed like a millenium  I opened the blinds  I saw nothing but branches and brush. I remember slowly dropping the blind and crying myself to sleep in a way my friends wouldn  t hear me. I can  t explain why  but whatever was looking back at me through that window could  ve easily killed me considering the trailer was on an incline and bricks due to the jacks breaking. I would love to go back  which is crazy on my behalf but its alluring. I would submit to a polygraph in a heart beat to get someone out there with me. ,We started in the back yard then walked a few blocks to the edge of the woods. ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12021,yes
1142,Sunday  March 11  2012 shortly past midnight. We were camping in a primitive campsite at Bear Island  Big Cypress Preserve in Collier County Florida. This campsite is off of ORV trails  meaning only off-road vehicles with permits may enter this area. It was a warm evening after a late afternoon rain shower. We had a camp fire burning  there were five of us at camp that night along with two Jeeps parked away from campsite. After sitting near the campsite I wanted to retrieve my charging cell phone from my Jeep. As i walked away from the camp and into the darkness of the night  I reached my Jeep  as I was opening the door  I had a feeling someone was watching me. I looked to my left and about 15   into the woods I saw a pair of glowing yellow  human shaped eyes staring back at me. I am 6  6  tall  and these eyes were level with me  possibly a few inches upward. I could feel the eyes staring into mine  and I watched them blink  slow and deliberate  just like a human. The overwhelming odor was undeniable it smelled like a combination of skunk and wet dog. Every hair on my body stood up right  I had instant goosebumps from my head to toe  and every instinct told me to flee. Without hesitation I quickly returned to the campfire.....Telling everyone what I had just witnessed  and assuring them I was not joking  I gathered a spotlight and a companion and walked over to check it out  without a sound we crept up  and heard nothing. Shining the light into the woods we did not see any signs of an animal  no deer  no bear  no low branches for an owl to be perched on  just a bare spot in the woods where the eyes were coming from. I have watched shows where people talk of Bigfoot sightings  and I always question them. I say I would have chased that thing through the woods with a camera and a flashlight. but now I understand  when you do see something like this  its a combination of shock  fear  and instinct. I would not write in with this sighting if I didn  t feel in my gut  and in my mind what I saw  was not something that SHOULD have been in those woods.I was reassured of my feelings this past weekend when we returned to camp in the same spot. We camped in the same location this past weekend. April 28th-29th 2012. Pink jeep number 7  Bear Island Campground  Big Cypress Preserve. This encounter however was not visual  but audible. We had a campfire  there were five of us sitting there. It was approx 10 15  when I playfully made a loud and long howl (Call) into the woods. However we all were astounded when I almost Instantly got a response. The howl  was not a coyote  it was not an owl  or a bear. And it was not a human playing along. The direction the sound came from  was also the direction I had seen the eyes in the woods previously. It is dense woods with no campsites  or foot access. Forward an hour in the future. Me and my daughter and wife are in our tent. My two friends are already asleep in theirs  staked out next to mine. The back of both of our tents are facing the opposite woods that we had heard the howl from. After being in our tents and laying down with the lights out. We were startled  by the loudest crashing sound coming from the woods behind us. It sounded like something just grabbed a tree  snapped it  and smacked part of it against itself. The sound was followed by a few footsteps  then silence. It was so loud and an unexpected sound it awoke the two friends in the tent next to us with a  what the heck was that?  . My daughter was the first to notice the odor that was suddenly lingering. Her and my wife compared it to skunk  i thought it smelled more like wet dog  urine smell. Very similar to the odor I noticed previously with the eye incident. I did scout the area where we heard the noise  but could not see anything. No fallen trees  and no obvious damage from where I could access. It did start to rain in the area early in the am. So when we woke up  it had been raining for sometime.Making it harder to notice anything out of place. Am I 100% positive I saw Skunk Ape? No  but I am 100% positive there is something down here  and it could be just that. I do think some further investigation would be very beneficial. ,Pink campsite #7   Bear Island  Big Cypress Preserve  Collier County  FL ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12021,yes
1143,I was out in the everglades target shooting when I heard something making a lot of noise behind me while I was reloading. When I turned around I say a bipedal ape-like thing looking from behind a tree.  I glared at it for a few seconds and I started running off. It scared the **** out of me.  As I got to my car  I saw the thing running behind the trees away from me and then I left in a hurry. ,about 20 miles west of Broward County ,Collier,21,Florida ,FL,Winter ,12021,yes
1144,My parents had a full-sized house trailer in Key Largo during the 1960s and 1970s for weekends and summer vacations.  At that time we lived north of Miami and would drive out SR 820 to US 27 to US 1 to get there.  After I got my own car and driver  s license in the late 1960s I began making the trip down there ahead of the rest of the family usually leaving about 4am each Saturday. On one particular Saturday in   71 or   72 I had  made it down US 27 to about 200th Avenue(outside of Homestead in the Redlands)when I spotted red flashing lights ahead.  Obviously it was a wreck and it looked like it just happened - only there was just one damaged car just off the road.  The LE present were from the FHP and the Dade County SO.  I stopped my car on the side of the road  people did that back then  and got out. I noticed what I remember as an American mid-sized car with a very crumpled left front quarter panel. Just about that time a trooper and deputy sheriff emerged from a very densely wooded area at a right angle to the road.  That part of Dade County was very rural at the time and US 27 was generally the dividing line between anything that passed for civilization and the Glades.  I then also noticed that a man who was quite upset talking to them. One of the LEs was shaking his head and saying no one could have walked away from impacting a car at that speed and walked away let alone run away.  The other said he never saw a bear move like that.  Then a P/U truck stopped and another car.  The trooper told us there wasn  t any need for us to be there and it was dangerous to be on the side of that road (traffic-wise it was one of the most dangerous in Fl). I never saw the creature or talked to the witnesses but I had this wierd feeling that you get when someone is staring at you - even before I knew what was going on.  I left and went on my way.  Well this wouldn  t mean much to anyone except later that day I heard on a radio news broadcast that a man said he hit the Florida Skunk Ape and that he claimed that two LE Officers had given it chase into a dense thicket. I hadn  t thought of much of this until about 15 years later I moved to another part of the state and got acquainted with hunters that claimed to have seen the creature  heard it  found its scat  and tracked it.  This being mostly in Lee and Collier Counties.  I just heard another story this last week and decided to tell what I know of an  almost  encounter. ,US 27 ,Dade,7,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12086,yes
1145,As told to the Investigator by the witness   I was driving south on Hwy 27 in Dade county. It was after 10 00pm  but before midnight. I saw a  hairy man  crawl from the water  stand up and walk across the road. He looked very human  in a distorted way  and was very large.  ,Highway 27 (Krome Ave) south of Tamiami Trail  but before Homestead. ,Dade,7,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12086,yes
1146,By the way the images captured by Jacobs are similar to what I saw near homestead Fla 30 years ago in the Naranja area off of Old dixie Highway. This creature can stand verticle and run a deer down easy. It is going to be next to impossible to capture. They run as fast as a cheeta perhaps faster. They are very curious but cautious and are easly spooked. , ,Dade,7,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12086,yes

1148,In the spring of 1994  my wife  two children and I were returning home to Fernandina Beach from Jacksonville traveling north on A1A. It was late  the kids were sleeping in the back seats  I was driving with wife in passenger seat. Living on Amelia Island (Fernandina Beach) with relatives in Jacksonville  we frequently made this 45 min to an hour drive 2 or 3 times a week. Although a scenic trip during the day  at night its just a boring two lane road cutting through intracoastal type pine tree  dune-filled land. With no traffic heading south  I had my bright lights on and was just listening to the radio and staring straight ahead. My wife was sitting quietly  and  I actually thought she had fallen alsleep as it was approaching midnight. I had just rounded a curve and began on a straight-away north to northwest toward the entrance to Little Talbot Island State Park  which is on the right side of the road  when  in the distance about 150-200 yds ahead on me  I caught glimpse of a bipedal figure standing on the West side of the road just off the right-of-way  not moving. My very first thought was it was a park ranger closing gates and whatnot  but the second that I thought that  the figure began to walk East across the road (A1A)  and driving 50 to 60 mph and closing fast on the creature  I began to slow down  all the while concentrating on just what I was seeing. The creature just walked right out in front of my car  never stopping  walking with purpose  swinging both arms  and I really don  t recall the creature ever turning its head to look toward me. I would say that it was between 6.5 to 7.5 feet tall  muscular but rather skinny  long  shaggy hair about its entire body  with a tan to reddish brown appearance. As I approached closer and slowed even more  the creature was just about to step off the road and back onto the sandy  grassy right-of-way when my wife  who I thought was asleep  said  What is that?! . I instantly said nervously  You see that...Oh my God  what the hell was that?!  The creature just walked right into the dune pine area just as we were passing (slowly) by. For an instant  I thought about stopping and turning around to shine my headlights on the area of the dunes that it went in  but looking in my rear view mirror it was black as black can get outside (no streetlights of any kind)  so I just continued driving north. Both me and my wife were very shakened and I looked at her and just said  Did we just see a Bigfoot?!  She answered back  I think so  I really think so!  For the rest on the drive we were a little freaked out  and when we got home  put the kids in their beds  we sat up the rest of the night going over and over again on just what we had just witnessed. ,Incident occurred while driving north on A1A or Heckscher Drive about 900 to 1000 feet south of the North entrance to Little Talbot Island State Park ,Duval,7,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12031,yes
1149,about 8 or 9 years ago  when i was working as a patrol offficer for a company here in jacksonville florida  a friend of mine was in a building that was backed up next to a large area of woods.  he said that he saw something standing next to a pine tree. i told him that i would be there in about 10 or 15 minutes. i told him that i was in the woods chasing some poachers out. he said to come to the back side of the building and i did. i told him on the radio that i was back there and he told me to put on my spotlight and when i did   i heard a noise that i will never forget. i saw something running past the trees  it was tall brown and hairy and was running fast. i then got the hell out of there and went to see my friend in that building. he asked me if i heard that noise and i said oh hell yes. we then went to where it was standing and about 9 feet up was a broken branch from that pine tree. the branch was at least 5 or 6 inches in diameter and it was clearly pulled out. last night on the radio i heard that same scream. i tried to call but the line was always busy on coast to coast. ,Off I-95.

1150,I am a security officer in Jacksonville  FL. I was on duty in an area know as Deerwood Park. Located in a quickly developing area that was once owned by Skinners Dairy. The area is still heavily wooded. Two weeks ago I was on duty in a building and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I was outside for 5 minutes. I heard a noise like something moving through the tree line. I turned my head toward the noise and the noise stopped. I called on of our vehicle patrols in the area and we moved to the tree line to investigate. We could hear the movement of something very large making very suttle movement. The officer with me and myself felt very uneasy. Laying on the ground 8-10 feet from the tree line was a branch from a pine tree. The needles on the branch were still green.There were no burn marks at the break to indicate lightning had struck. The branch was approximatly 3 inches in diameter and appears to have been broken and then ripped from the tree.What ever it was sounded as though it moved away from us through the marsh land. This whole incident really creeped me out.On Fri/9-1-00 at about the same time 2 30A.M. The same patrol officer and myself were again standing outside the building I guard. We heard a sonic alarm coming from the building to the north of our location. The patrol officer I was talking to walked back to his car to drive over and investigate. The alarm stopped as though it reset or was deactivated. I informed the patrol officer that it was probably the cleaning crew. As we continued talking about what we were going to do in the gym that mourning. The officer I was talking to turned his head and his eyes got real big. He replyed.  Look at that . I turned around and looked toward the tree line and observed nothing. The patrol officer I was talking to sped off in his vehicle in the direction of the trees and I followed on foot. We searched the area and found nothing. The officer told me that he observed heavly built individual who  s estimated height was between 7-8 feet in height. The individual appeared all black. The officer I was talking to said when he told me to look  the subject had crossed out of my line of site around another building 100 feet to the south of our location. This officer appeared to be very serious about what he saw. On Sun/9-3-00. I was talking to the other officer who works the same area. He told me of a resident he talked to six months ago who lives 1 mile to the east of my post. This resident inquired if we did foot patrols through his community? Which was at the time was sparsley populated. When the officer said   no . The resident continued that a few nights before around dusk he heard a splash in the lake behind his house. What he saw climb out of the lake and walk toward the south and into the trees was exactly what the other officer told me he saw. The resident further stated that this was a regular occurance. ,Off I-95. The area sits between Southside Blvd. to the west. J.Turner Butler Blvd. to the north.

1151,I was patroling an area near the University of North Florida  when something caught my attention on the side of the road. I turned around and went back to the spot to get a better look. When I was in the woods I noticed several strange limb and tree formations. i saw arches T.P. formations and some  X  formations. I noticed that these were up close to the road. As I walked around and investigated the area I felt as if I was being watched. I heard some movement in the brush. I thought it may have been just an animal that I am used to. I tried to move to get a better look at what was in the brush. I never made a good visual. I found it strange that what ever it was did not flee. It was shadowing my movements and using the brush and lighting conditions to remain out of my sight. I did smell a smell that was like the smell of a dog that had dried off naturally after playing in standing water. The are of this incident was wooded and wetlands. It leads down into a swampy area and a creek that traverses the highway to a larger wooded area. Fell free to contact me for more information. I am willing to show this area to an investigator if you have one in the Jacksonville area. ,If I am contacted I will take any one who wants to see the location to it. ,Duval,7,Florida ,FL,Spring ,12031,yes
1152,Right on the northwest corner of New World Ave. and Normandy Blvd. FSCJ owns approx. 135 acres. When things are slow I take our electric golf cart thru the woods just to look around and maybe spot wildlife as I go. Between the college and the city pool which is west of the college are numerous ponds  wetlands  and pine tree flats on forestry land. There are also alot of training areas left over from the Navy days and a few old roads that are similiar to power line right aways running mostly north and south. Now to the day in question  We were allowing a contractor to drive thru our property to gain access to the forestry land and I went to talk to them to get an update on the project. It turned out they were not working that day so I was riding around just looking for wildlife. I came up to one of the old roads and when I looked north on the road there was something in the road sitting on it  s hunches and it appeared to have one arm in the air and the other was scratching it  s side. I was traveling kind of fast and could not stop until I was about 10 feet past the road. I put the cart in reverse to back up and it was not in the road any longer. I looked just past the spot where it was in the road and it was on the side of the road and was bending down a limb from a 4 or 5 foot pine tree peering out at me. This lasted for maybe 3 or 4 seconds and it ran in from what I could tell was an upright position. The small pines hindered my view when it was running but I am fairly positive it was running up right. What ever it was  was about 2 maybe 3 foot tall judging by the trees and was very black and resembled a primate. I worked at the Jax Zoo in maintenance for a few years and one of the exhibits I was responsible for was the Great Apes so I am very familiar with several different primates and it reminded me very much of a bonobo. I was fairly shaken up and I did not go look for tracks  signs  or anything. Now to present  a few weeks ago forestry had a timber company thinning the pines in the same area  I went back there to talk to the job foreman as they were using our property to gain access. They were two or three hundred yards back in the woods and I did not want to drive my cart back there because of the road. I got maybe thirty yards off the road down the skidder trail and I am not sure what it was but the hair on my neck stood straight. I had a strong sense something was out there watching me. It may have been my imagination but I really believe I was being watched. ,This is a close military base in an area rumored to have held nuclear arms. ,Duval,7,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12031,yes
1153,This just happened to me about 5 15am this morning. I stepped out on the balcony of my second story apartment I  m in Atlantic Beach fl. I live about 3 to 5 min from Hannah park. I turned on the back porch light as I walked out.  I took about two or three steps out onto the balcony and I heard a loud screaching yell and then three woo whoo whoo noises. As I live and breathe that WAS the sound of a primate!! Immediately the dog in a fence of a neighbor  s house right behind the apartment began barking like crazy for about 30 seconds and then stopped. It kind of freaked me out I thought  did an ape escape from Jax zoo or something? I crouched down a little on the balcony and watched the area. In about 5 min I could see the tree in the very back of the apartment back yard rustle a little and it was as if something was moving toward the fence. Then I heard two low grunts from the ground from inside the fence on the neighbors side. It is a privacy fence so I couldn  t see what made the grunt. The way the fences are all I could hear were like footsteps moving along the fence toward the trees I saw one shadow really dark moving along the fenceline...it wasn  t a person because the shoulders were way too wide and bulky and it wasn  t even fully upright. It kind of lumbered along like an ape....people just don  t move like that. , ,Duval,7,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12031,yes
1154,On Saturday  11/21/09 I went squirrel hunting in the Escambia River Management Area in Escambia County Florida. I began to walk into the woods at approximately 6 00am. The area I chose to hunt is a section of woods bordering the river. As I was walking  I heard a low  guttural vocalization that sounded almost like a native american dialect  only in a much lower range than most people would speak in. It reminded me of the Samurai chatter that I have heard on your website and others. I heard the sounds for about 10 to 15 seconds  and then once again a few minutes later. On Wednesday  11/25/09  my oldest daughter and I returned to the area to hunt squirrel. We hiked back into the woods for about a mile  and found a log to sit on amidst several promising looking trees with squirrel nests. On the way into the area  we walked a game trail and smelled that  wet deer  smell that you often encounter around white tails. Almost immediately upon arriving  my daughter asked if I heard what she did. I asked her what it sounded like  and she said it sounded like someone walking through the woods. I told her I did hear it  did she think it was a deer  or wild hog  or some other animal. She said  no daddy  it sounds like a man walking . I had noticed myself that the steps sounded bipedal. Upon leaving the area  I decided to take the opportunity to show her various signs of wildlife in the area. The game trail goes throught the middle of a small meadow. The meadow contained tracks from deer  wild hog  turkey  armidillo  racoon  etc.. There are many fallen logs in the area from hurricane Ivan a few years ago  and they have become prime locations for grubs to inhabit. This is probably why so many different types of animals are making use of the meadow. One track in particular caught our attention. It was the bare footprint of what appeared to be a large man  toe prints included. My size 13 boot is 16 inches in length  and this print was approximately an inch longer than my bootprint. The print was made in a soft mound around an ant bed. I placed my boot print in the mound as closely as I could. The surrounding ground was too hard for tracks to show. My daughter immediately assumed that it was a bigfoot track. There are stories of  swamp boogers  in this area  so it really did not surprise us. I took a photo with my cell phone  which as soon as I can figure out how to download to the computer  I will  be glad to provide. I put a 3  shotgun shell in the print crossways to show the size. It was about 5  wide in the heel  and closer to 7  to 8  broad just before the toes.r ,Take U.S. 29 north from Cantonment  Fl. approximately 15 miles.

1155,I was out hiking one morning on a popular local trail when I decided to explore the area around it using my GPS. It is an open hammock containing old growth liveoaks with a lot of surrounding history from the sugarmill period all the way back to the first native americans that inhabited the area thousands of years ago. I was  off trail  approximately several hundred yards when I came upon an un-natural looking intertwined tree formation capped off with a dead  y  shaped branch weaved in the top. I tried to think of how this could have occurred naturally but it simply could not have. I marked the site and took pictures and basically forgot about it until I read a report of an encounter in the same area by some local fishermen.

1156,I have been hunting a large tract of private land for a little over 3 years now. It is comprised of planted pine hardwood  and cypress swamps. It is bordered on all sides by other large tracts of private land and WMA  s that connect to Ocala National Forest.The first encounter occurred in 2012 during archery season  At dusk as I sat in camo in a tree stand at dusk I heard a blood curdling scream in a small swamp close to my stand. Then heavy footprints circled behind me where I could not see. An object came hurdling through the trees and passed above me. Then a few minutes later a stone hit the tree I was in just below me. At that point I stood up and yelled in that direction and made my way back to the truck. Since that time myself and everyone that I have taken hunting in this section of the lease has had some type of encounter. Either the murder scream  knocks  tree breaks  stone throws or a howl. I have had 2 daylight sightings in the swamp. The first was as I was setting up a tree stand. I heard a crash and looked and saw an all black creature peaking from behind a large cypress tree. It was apx. 7 ft tall  thick and muscular. The second was as I went into a stand to put down feed at apx. 11am. I walked up on one either napping or resting in a patch of very thick brush. I watched as it ran in long strides into the swamp out of sight. It was apx.7-8 ft tall  all back  and built more like a NFL linebacker. Lean and muscular. Since that time we refer to them as the  twins . I continue to hunt and go there. I feel they know its me and choose to either ignore me or mess with me. I have taken people to this area at night to try to experience what me and my hunting buddies have heard. On all occasions we had good results with either knocks  howls or tree breaks and thrown objects. , ,Flagler,3,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12035,yes

1158,I was a boy of about 12 years of age camping on my parent  s land.  We had a house atop a hill that sloped down an acre or two  leading to Bear Creek  which is where our property ended.  The land on both banks of the creek was thickly wooded and our land was not cleared all the way to the water.  Three of my friends and I had built a fire and unrolled our sleeping bags about a hundred yards or so away from the house in the direction of the creek.  One of the younger boys was not permitted to stay all night and as he left to go home  two of us were shining our flashlights at him and teasing him about a boogey man getting him.  He was probably about twenty yards or less away from our little campsite  walking throught the tall (2-3 ft.) grass.  In the dim light of the flashlights at that distance I saw a few yards behind him and walking in the opposite direction a form that looked like a large biped.  My best estimate would make it 6   5  or taller.  What I saw was from halfway between the elbow and shoulder to about halfway between the knee and ankle  so my height estimate is quite rough.  It took about three strides before it went from on side of the light to the other  the strides were long and smooth  not at all jerky  and it looked like the knees remained bent as if it was not standing straight upright but slouching somewhat  and the arms swung low.  Under the poor lighting conditions I could not tell what color it was  it looked gray in the shadowy lighting  and it looked furry or hairy.  Had I thought of it  I would have tried to follow the form with my falshlight  but the first thing I did was look at the boy sitting on the ground next to me  who was also holding a flashlight  and he was already looking at me very wide-eyed.  He asked  Did you see that?  and I stood up and called for the departing boy to come back.  He returned and when we told him what we had seen  neither he nor the other boy there believed us.  He went home and the two of us who had seen it  not venturing far from the fire  looked around with our flashlights but we didn  t see anything unusual.  Neither of us would admit we were afraid so we stayed all night (but didn  t sleep much)  The next day I looked for footprints or disturbed soil or grass and found nothing. ,The parcel of land is located where North Bear Creek Road converges with South Bear Creek Road  approximately 1/4 mile from U.S. Hwy 231. ,Bay,4,Florida ,FL,Unknown ,12005,yes

1160,I would never have made any type of report about this incident but after listening to the first 2 audio recordings on your site I was compelled to tell you about an incident that I experienced along with 2 of my friends. It was fall of 2000 and we were riding in a jeep through the woods north of Panama City in a wooded area near the power plant off of hwy 77.  We were doing some low grade four wheel driving in an area that falls between immediate coastline and some heavily wooded areas; areas that are sometimes incredibly thick and densely wooded swamps.  We happened to stop the jeep in order to make a navigational decision when we all heard the loudest and definitely the strangest sound I had ever heard.  It was truly beyond description and I am not a person to be lost for descriptors.  The three of us immediately began a  did you hear that?  dialogue when we heard essentially the same noise again. The only reason I bothered to submit this is because of those audio clips.  I am an audio engineer and am very familiar with sound.  In addition I have lived in this area for the majority of my life having spent many days and nights in the woods hearing and seeing all sorts of things.  This was  until tonight  beyond my experience.  None of us could  with any certainty  say what we heard. ,From Panama City travel north on state hwy 77 through Lynn Haven and just north of Southport.  Turn left on the road that goes to the power plant (the steam plant in local parlance).  Towrds the end of the road (where the power plant sits) is a dirt road  heavily rutted  that brings you to a canal used by the power plant as a collection canal.  The water is usually very warm and in the winter people fish there (esp at night) and sometimes go swimming there (very NOT safe to do).  There are sandy/muddy trails/roads throughout the area that cover LOTS of area.  The area is very diverse in landscape/topography and varies from coastal wetland/marshland to thick wooded swamp. ,Bay,4,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12005,no
1161,My family and I took a boat ride to the Shell Island Beach (it wasn  t really an island  it eventually connected to the mainland).  When we anchored I got out  and proceeded into the forest farther in.  As I began to approach the forest I heard a high pitched scream that I mistook as a bird at first  I then saw a large brown mass moving to my right in the trees in front of me.  I saw it for no more than a second as I turned around an ran back to the beach. ,The island was across from St. Andrews State Park. ,Bay,4,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12005,yes

1163,My sighting was 41 years ago at NW 21 Terr/NW 31 Ave in Gainesville Fl.  Back then it was mostly woods and I was going to see a neighbor at a slow jog  looked to my right and we were both surprised.  He was what I figure to be about 7 ft 6 in.  He had big dark round eyes  lots of hair and just stared at me till I took off.  No sound  he didn  t come after me he just stared. I know it was a long time ago  but I did see Sasquatch. ,The Subdivision was Orman Leigh Estate ,Alachua,4,Florida ,FL,Unknown ,12001,yes
1164,Alachua County  Florida  around 1985 We lived in the country  with thousands of wild acres around our five acre plot.  While walking on  our paved road in front of our house one morning  I saw a creature cross the road about 250 yards from me.  I am a trained psychologist with a specialty in ready body language and knowing human gait and movement.  This creature moved more like an ape than a human.  He crossed at the small bridge over a flowing creek  and crawled down the side of the bridge into the creek and disappeared.  I ran over and went into the creek  only about a foot deep  to see if I could catch up with him  but there was not a trace. The very strange thing is that he was covered with green material  and it looked like leaves or palm branches from the sable palm.  Have you ever heard of a bigfoot doing this to make himself less visible in the woods? ,Near county road 237 and NW 156th Steet(or Ave? everything has been re-numbered for 911 addresses ,Alachua,4,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12001,yes
1165,I am subitting this true report for my Cousin who I am very close to and keep in touch with regularly that lives outside of Gainsville  Florida  in Ocala County.  She has told me this amazing story several times before  and she is a very trustworthy person.  I strongly felt that this amazing encounter of hers should be reported  and she agreed.  As she told me  it was a very clear morning.  My Cousin was driving her and her younger Son to town on a narrow stretch of road near Gainsville  Florida  early one morning around 7 00 AM.  She may have been taking her Son to school but I cannot remember.  The narrow road she was on had swamps on both sides of it and looked messy.  As she was driving along all of a sudden a hairy upright creature walked right up out of the swamp on one side of the road and continued walking out in front of her car  and then it just stopped.  She immediately stopped the car just a few feet away from this thing not wanting to hit it  and just stared in shock at what she and her Son were seeing.  The  manlike  creature had stopped in the middle of the road and was turned around looking directly at them  and they got a very good look at the whole body of the creature.  The creature walked upright like a human with a gait and looked like a  caveman   is the way she put it to me.  The creature had hair all over its body except for around the eyes  nose  and mouth of its face.  The most astonishing feature that she noticed though was that the creature was wearing some kind of  animal skin  for protection or something.  She was in shock.  This creature had to be intelligent to create and wear its own hand-made animal skin.  The creature showed no aggressive behavior  and after a couple of minutes or so just casually walked back into the swamp on the other side of the road.  The thing looked half human and half ape!  The creature was about 7-8 feet tall as well.  When she got home she told her Husband what had happened  and at first he didn  t believe her.  For further reference I can give you my telephone number so you can contact her in Florida.  I am a true mystery writer  and just had to share this amazing story with you.  I do know that these amazing creatures really do exist! ,Very swampy area. ,Alachua,4,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12001,yes
1166,I was riding my mountain bike in the forest. I had been climbing a while so I pulled off the trail to rest. That is when I looked down and seen these huge foot prints that appeared to be barefoot. I took pictures. I wear an 8 1/2 women. These look to be about a 17. It was also off the trail which made me think that was even odder. I did hear stomping noise out there which I believe were wild boar in the distance. There was a time later that I smelled something nasty. I never saw anything but those prints freaked me out a little bit. ,San Felasco Hammock Preserve State Park ,Alachua,4,Florida ,FL,Fall ,12001,no
1167,On the twenty sixth and again on the twenty seventh at approximately 5 00-5 15 am  I was on my way to work. I travel down Mt. Plymouth rd.in Sorrento FL. This is an area directly in the Wekiva River basin. As I started through the s turns I saw another car coming in the opposite direction  as that car passed a large animal stepped out from behind that car  I think he was crossing until he seen my truck  it then pivited  turned and went back into the wooded area. On the next morning on my way to work again I got a better look at it  still in the same series of turns  except this time coming out of the last one  I seen it take one step in part of my lane then on across the road and was gone. I was looking down towards the hood of my truck at this time and can tell you that whatever it was  was very large  its waist area was about 1 foot above my hood of my ford ranger pick up. ,head n.on highway 441 from Orlando then go east on st.rt.46  finally head back s on mt. plymouth rd. ,Lake,37,Florida ,FL,Summer ,12069,yes
1168,I was in a hunting club for couple years. One morning I took my son hunting with me who was 8 years old at the time. I had several places on the property I could go that morning and I decided to go where I always saw something  some turkey  hogs  and deer. Deer was what we was hunting and this spot I been to several times and always saw something. This location we called the island because it was surounded by water and the only way to get there is by ATV or a UTV. The location of the island was approximately half the hunting club was part of the swamp. It also butted up to a state park called Balls Ferry. So me and my son parked the ATV about 300 yards from the blind we was hunting out of. I will go ahead and add this  as soon as i stepped off the ATV something did not feel right  like we was being watched. I was waiting for us to spot another hunter back there but never saw one. While we was in the blind that morning it was strange that we didnt see anything. It was very quiet. All i remember is hearing the wind blow occasionally. Around 9 30 we gave up and walked back to the ATV. I have a gun holder on the front of my ATV and i put my rifle up front snugged down. We started heading out and about halfway out i noticed my rifle getting loose on the front so i decided to stop in this clearing that id say was about 120 yards wide and 80 yards long. I turn my ATV off while my son stayed on. I eased up to the front of my ATV and was securing my rifle. As i got done I turned and was about to get back on my ATV and this is when i heard a gorilla like sound except this sound was a much deeper sound. It was almost to the point to feeling the sound. I did not know what to think of it. My son looked at me with fear and let me tell you  I was Ok at first  but when this thing made that sound 4 more times  i was terrified. I did not want my son to know i was terrified but i jumped on the ATV. I was cranking it while i jumped in gear. I went as fast as i could on that thing. I looked back to see whatever this thing was to see if it was chasing us but all i saw was some tops of pine trees moving  and each top i saw was moving away from us. On the way back to the camp  i was trying to figure out what i heard. Never in a million years that sasqautch crossed my mind. Then i thought someone was messing with us but as soon as i got to camp i saw everyone there so i knew it wasnt them and also if it was how was they even making that sound. Immediately they knew something was wrong and i told them what i heard and they was trying to figure out the noise. There was this guy who had been a member there for years told me to sit down that he wanted to tell me something that happen to him and another guy hunting couple years before. To make a long story short from what he told me is they went in one morning to hunt  he got in his tree stand and the other guy went onto his tree stand and 45 min later the guy was running back to him looking over his shoulder like something chasing him. Anyways they rushed back to the truck and on the way outta there the guy tells him that he saw what was suppose to be a myth  a sasqautch.The guy doesnt go in the woods at dark  if he goes hunting  and he tells me the guy has never been back there hunting. To me at the time after receiving this information  i shrugged it off and thinking to myself that no way this was true and that is not what i heard. So for the next 3 years i kinda blocked it out of my mind. i also never went back hunting to this place. I knew whatever that was  it wasnt good. The noise i heard was in the back of my mind but i didnt want to accept it. Fast forward 4 years  I was scrolling through youtube watching some videos.Ive always enjoyed survivorman with Les Stroud. So i started watching an interview with him. He was in alaska and he had the same thing happen to him with that same sound i heard. That draws my interest so i started watching more videos on sasqautch. On this one video  halfway through it they was playing some sounds of sasqautch that had been recorded during the night. Thats when i heard the sound that me and my son heard at the hunting club. The could feel the hairs on the back of my neck raise up and chills come over me. Thats when i started being a believer. The next day I showed the video to my son who was 16 at the time and he also knew it was the sound we heard. Ever since then ive had an open mind and before that i always thought sasqautch was a myth.  ,This happened off 112 about 2 miles from toomsboro  ga deep in the swamp area 32 53   42.9234 N 83 4    11.7743 W Nothing but wilderness all around for miles [Investigator (MM) Notes  the above GPS coordinates in decimal form  32.895257  -83.069937 ,Wilkinson,1,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13319,no
1169,I was traveling in my vehicle coming across a bridge with a well known river passing underneath  when I noticed a large tree that had fallen into the water off to the right about 200 yards. As I looked at it  I peered up over the concrete railing and saw something standing in the river perhaps 75 yards away. My first thought was   well  there  s a bear  . But as I kept looking  it was apparent to me that it did not have a snout of any sort. It  s face was like a human face  but black. This creature seemed to be in the middle of something (fishing?) and I had either spooked it or interrupted it. As I looked at it  it was looking at me and following my vehicle with it  s gaze. It was black and it had long hair  like a shaggy dog. Trying to remember now  but I don  t believe it had a neck of any sort that I could see.I corrected myself  before veering over too far and rubbing against the railing. I kept driving. It never occurred to me until later that what I saw was a Bigfoot. Am very familiar with Bigfoot and thought if I ever saw one it would be walking away or from a distance  and be a unique experience to remember for a lifetime  but it was nothing like this. And to be honest with you  it was an intimidating experience and I have not been back to that area since. ,This is an area that I am very familiar with  have fished there many times  seen deer  bobcat and coyotes but nothing strange or never heard any strange sounds.Before I was born there were rumors of panthers in the area. Lots of wilderness in this area. Years ago  teenagers used to swim in the river.And people would throw out their trash  old mattresses or furniture there. About 10 years ago  the old dirt road was blocked and a new road was paved with a new bridge put over it and I used it quite frequently  but not everyday. The nearest house was probably 200 yards away. ,Whitfield,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13313,yes

1171,I was deer hunting on Pigeon Mountain and was following a group of deer when I shot and wounded an almost solid black buck with a large rack. The buck followeded a well worn game trail and I had trailed the deer by blood drops. It was getting dark and the terrain was getting to difficult to continue and I had no light. I had to turn and come down the mountain. I began to feel like I was not alone  there were none of the normal animal sounds (birds  squirrels ets). I heard something coming down the mountain taking a parallel path I was taking. I could not see any thing. There were limbs breaking  leaves rustling and then I would hear nothing. I had unloaded my gun for saftey and reloaded because I had never heard an animal move threw the woods like this one. Myself  one other person and the owner were the only people allowed to hunt in the area and the terrain it was using was to rough for a human to travel much less move at the speed this animal was. One minute it would sound like a raging bull and the next minute it would move down the mountain not making a sound. I heard a grunt and a growl. I was terrified and felt as I was being stalked by something I had never encountered before. When I stopped so did it. When I moved slow  it moved slow. When I moved faster  it moved faster. I was most worried when I would hear nothing. I reached the base of the mountain and had taken a wrong turn and had put myself infront of a large briar patch  I did not let that stop me. I dove threw the briars cutting and scratching myself. I finally reached the saftey of my truck and once again heard the grunting noise from behind me. I did not return to look for the buck I had shot or ever hunt in that area again. I did not ever see anything  but something large was in the woods that night. I have not felt safe in the woods since. I had hunted  fished and farmed in the area all my life. I felt as though I knew all the animals in the woods and the sound they made as they moved. I was taught to stalk hunt by an employee who worked on our farm and he had lived in the Smokey Mountains and fed his family by hunting game. I had heard deer grunt before and this was no deer grunt.  ,Pigeon mountain about a mile from the turn of a hwy 193.

1172,A relative recently built a house in a slighty remote southern area of Upson County. The property of about 50 acres has a small lake which has been there for about 30 years.  A few miles south is lots of wooded areas  and the county is bordered by the Flint River. Around June 15  2004  about 10 00 A.M  one mostly cloudy  but hot and humid morning  I arrived at her house to plant some flowers in her flower bed.  I had been there about 45 minutes and had taken a break to drink some water when I heard a sound that I had never heard before  but knew for sure that whatever it was  had power behind it. It really got my attention since I was alone at the time.  I listenned for about 2 more minutes and I heard the sound again much clearer and could tell that it seemed to be coming down towards the lake.  The lake can  t be seen from the house.  This creature called Bigfoot automatically came to my mind because I knew it had to be powerful to produce that sound.  I left immediately because I was frightened and came home to look on the internet for bigfoot sounds.  I found on the Oregon Bigfoot site the sound.  the first 2 screams on the  Puyallup Screamer  file is exactly what I heard.  I told my cousin  s roommate that I had heard something and she said immediately that I should talk to my cousin because she had heard it too. , ,Upson,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13293,no
1173,We were walking back from a nightly walk killing time waiting for people to arrive at my friend [name removed]  s house when we got about 300 ft. from his house we heard a noise behind us just at the tree line at the edge of the road  [name removed] turned his head back to look  next thing I know he  s running yelling run man run  I stopped and turned to see a figure on the top of the embankment stepping down across the ditch to the middle of the dirt road  I stood their for only about 5 seconds but it was enough to confirm my belief that sasquatch lives  it made a quick grunt like sound  thats when I began to run. At that time all 5 of [name removed]  s chow dogs ran past me to go after whatever was their I heard what sounded like the most awful dog fight ever in the woods along with what sound like a just a heavy roar and some shrieks along with some dog wimpering.

1174,My sighting occurred when I was about 10 years old on my Grand Father  s farm located in Troup County  Georgia. This was the most terrifying experience I have ever had in my entire life.  I don  t mention this event to my friends because I am sure they would not believe me. When I was a young boy  I accompanied my Grand Father to his 98 acre farm every day from his home located in LaGrange.  He had about 60 head of cattle  hogs  chickens and a mule. He also grew corn and vegetables and had a 2 acre watermelon patch.  After doing my chores on the farm  I liked to roam all over the property  especially down to the creek and 10+ acre swamp which was created by beavers damning up the creek. It was late one winter afternoon and I was walking in the woods far away from the old farm house when I noticed some move in the woods behind me. I remember it was late in the day  almost the time of sunset  when I was walking along the path leading back to the house when I saw  it  out of the corner of my eye. A huge  7 foot tall  ape-looking creature that was covered in tangled hair. The creature was standing completely still with its long arms hanging at its sides. The one thing that I saw that I will never forget was its 2 big yellow eyes that were staring straight at me. I felt my heart skip and knew this creature  or whatever it was  was like nothing I had ever seen in my life. It was about 80 yards away and I knew that if it started running  it could probably easily run me down as it had extremely long  gangly legs. I was completely and utterly terrified.  I knew the only way I could escape was to turn and run as hard and as fast as I could  back to the house. I did just that - jumping over the one cross-fence located between me and the house  which was about a quarter of a mile away. I knew that I tripped or snagged myself on the fence  the creature would catch me and rip me to pieces. I was near  exhaustion upon arriving back at the house; completely out of breath. I immediately went to my Grand Father  s side where I almost collapsed. I never told him about my sighting or anyone else  until years later after I was married.  I have since then told my wife and parents and one close friend about my sighting. I will be more than happy to explain more about my Bigfoot sighting. I truly believe with all my heart that what I saw that day was a real Bigfoot. After my sighting  I never one time went down to the swamp by myself. Previous to my sighting  I would often find some of my Grand Father  s young calves lying dead in the woods  near the swamp. I wondered how and why this could occur  but after my sighting  I knew that the Bigfoot had killed these young calves as well as some of a neighbor farmer  s goats. I remember one calf that appeared to have been ripped open i.e. mutilated. Later  after my Grand Father passed away  my Mother inherited the property and allowed some of her friends to hunt deer on the old farm place. One hunter told us recently that he had heard a howling like none other while hunting very early one morning on the farm. He said it sounded  not like a cry or howl  but more like a scream. Said it even frightened him and he is a seasoned hunter of many years! My story may sound make fake  but believe me  I know exactly what I saw that day and it was a living  breathing Bigfoot. ,Removed for confidentiality. ,Troup,2,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13285,yes
1175,Two friends and I were driving out to the country to check out and old graveyard. Near the old graveyard there  s a new church and a larger new graveyard. It was late at night probably around ten or eleven pm. We were heading down a dirt road to go to the old graveyard. Around the new church there was a big street light. As we passed by the church we noticed this big shadow standing (on two feet) under the light. We turned around to check it out thinking it was a person and wondering why they were there so late at night. As we headed toward this shadow it took off running still on 2 feet toward the new graveyard.  We followed it with the car through the graveyard on dirt road. We drove up next to a large headstone and just as we thought we lost sight of this thing it stood up from behind the headstone. We froze as it stared at us. It was very tall  about 7 or 8 feet  and had long brown hair that covered it  s entire body. It  s eyes looked red  I guess from the glare of the head lights. It only stood there for a few short seconds and then turned and ran off into the woods. Needless to say after seeing it we did not try to continue to follow it. We were just teenagers and having a few beers that night so we never told anyone about this. We thought they would just say we were crazy or drunk. I did however hear other stories about other sightings of something like this in that area. Also heard one story that it might have been a lost soldier since this was close to [Fort Stewart] Army base. I never really knew what it was that we saw that night. Didn  t want to go back and find out. ,This occured in the countryside of Glennville  Georgia.  The name of the road was Beards Creek Road. The sighting was near Beards Creek Church. ,Tattnall,2,Georgia ,GA,Unknown ,13267,yes
1176,I had been hunting with my 2 older brothers. One of my brothers had shot a deer and they were following the blood trail in an attempt to locate the deer that had been shot.  I had been left at the bottom of the gully to watch equipment. The sun had already set  but it wasn  t dark yet  twilight. I had waited for approximatly 20 to 30 mins  when  something  woofed at me from the edge of the tree line about 10 yards away. It was a deep sound that startled me.  After hearing this  I thought it better that I wait at the top of the gully  where my brothers had entered the woods. Before long  my brothers had returned  but without the deer.They had been unable to locate it. I told them what I had heard and neither of them took me too series. The 3 of us walked back to where the equipment had been layed  I didn  t pick it up on my quick hike up the hill. After we had gathered the equipment  we started to walk up the opposite side of the gully going back to our vehicle. The trail was in a backwards  L  shape with the gully being on the long side of the L. As we began to walk up the hill  there were sounds of heavy foot falls in the woods on the side of the trail.  When we would stop walking the sounds would continue for a few seconds and then stop.  What ever was walking in the woods was walking parralell to us. My oldest brother called into the woods thinking it may be a lost hunter  but there was no response.We walked about another 20 yards and the foot falls continued.This became a big concern due to the fact that what ever was walking in the woods would eventually meet us going to our vehicle due to the shape of the trail  cutting us off from our vehicle.  Again  my oldest brother called into the woods  but with no response.  He then fired about 10 rounds into the air  thinking if it was an animal the sound would spook it away.  But again  as we started walking so did the  animal  in the woods.  My oldest brother again called into the woods  issueing a warning that what ever was there better leave or he would fire into the woods. No response  we started walking again and so did the  animal  in the woods. My oldest brother then proceeded to fire into the woods in the general direction of the sounds. We didn  t notice if the foot falls continued  by this time we were all pretty scared and were working just to get back to our vehicle and go home.We made it back to the truck with no further incidents.We had all been raised in the woods and new the sound of most animals that normally would be encountered  but this was something very different.  Also  we had been  hunting this particular location for 2 seasons and had never experienced anything like this.  From that point on  I only hunted from a  stand  or with another person. ,Between Plains and Richland ,Sumter,9,Georgia ,GA,Unknown ,13261,yes
1177,I was 12 years old and visiting friends (13 year old twins) who lived in this mountainous area. It is not very densely populated  and most inhabitants of the mountain are members of the family. We were walking into the woods but were still within eyesight of two houses and a field. The boy and I noticed it about the same time. We saw a tall (about 7 feet tall)  bulky  lumbering figure coming toward us  from about 30-40 feet away. It was lumbering upright but was hunched over. It had a very large head. It was coming toward us. We turned around and ran toward the clearing  yelling for the girl to follow us. It chased us and got to within probably 15 feet of us. It stopped before the edge of the woods. We didn  t see where it went  because we ran until we were out of breath  well away from the edge of the woods The boy and I were trying to come to terms with what we had seen. We both agreed it looked like a cross between a man and a bear  or a man in a bear suit. For some reason I associate the color blue with it  as well. The girl said she never saw it  but she actually ran out in front of us. The boy and I didn  t get a good look at facial features  as our main goal was to get the heck out of there. I do recall its face was hairy  not smooth. I do not recall any type of a noise  though I vaguely remember a strong  musty animal smell. I do not recall if we told any of their family what happened. I am thinking that we thought no one would believe us  and he and I were so very certain about what we had seen and experienced that we did not wish to have to defend ourselves. The fact that WE knew what had happened was enough. I did tell my parents  who thought it was a little incredible but never said that they didn  t believe me. To this day  19 years later  the only other person I have told is my husband. ,Approximately (as best I can recall) from Toccoa  about 5 miles west on GA 123  then north about 5 miles.

1178,It all started around mid May 2008. I went to feed my two pit bulls around 11 30 pm one night  me and my wife had returned home late from eating out.  While taking the dogs food to them I heard a long moan / howl coming from the woods behind my house I at first thought it was my neighbor but it just did not make sense because it actually sounded farther off in the woods than my neighbors house sits. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I started surfing the internet later on after that and came across the BFRO website and played a few vocalizations and the Ohio Moan / Howl sounded just like the one I heard.  I actually talked to a couple of investigators on the matter. Since then I have become very interested in  Bigfoot and Sasquatch sightings and news. I decided to ask my wife if she had heard or seen anything unusual around the woods and house  she asked me why and I reluctantly  told her I thought I had heard a Sasquatch in the woods. She started laughing and said â€œ I guess they throw rocks at the house and garage tooâ€. Well my jaw dropped I asked her what she meant and she told me that the whole time I was  deployed to Iraq (2005-2006)when she would come out on the back porch to smoke at night some one would throw rocks and sticks at our garage which  is not attached to our house and sits back in the wood line some. She even had her brother come out and listen one night while he was down on vacation it freaked both of them out. That was pretty much the extent of every thing until 3 nights ago  the weather had turned really cold here in Ga and when I would go out to smoke at night I would not stay long. It was during one of the brief smoke breaks that around 1 00 AM I was staring out into the front yard when I caught some movement in the corner of my eye  I turned my head just in time to see the massive back  shoulders and head of this enormous creature disappear behind some bushes. It was fairly close to the yard light I have in my yard but just far enough away to not be able to tell the actual color of this thing I would guess a dark brown or grayish. I went out and measured a limb that I am fairly sure was about even with its head and the limb measured at exactly 10 feet so the height was about 10 feet tall it was slightly hunched over with no visible neck and a shoulder width  the best I can guess  of about 3-4 feet across it looked like it covered the distance of 6-7 feet with one step ( although I could not see its legs and feet I am judging by its gate) I could not see its face but its fur looked like a horses winter coat that had not been combed out.   ,Exact location omitted. ,Spalding,1,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13255,yes
1179,I was sitting in a deer stand (box 12 foot high on stilts) about 0530 AM. In Randolph county  GA on my grandfather  s land.  I climbed up and it was still dark out  about 30 degrees.  About 30 minutes after climbing in the stand and settling down I noticed a musty  dank smell  kind of like a wild hog that  s been in a wallow  but really swampy.  It kept getting stronger and keep in mind I  m about 100 yards off a dirt road in the woods.  I saw something about 7.5 - 8   tall step out from behind a tree  swaying back and forth looking at me from either side of the tree. I reached for my gun  and when I looked back up it was gone. I didn  t see any tracks when I looked after I got out  I  ve never hunted that stand since Thanksgiving 2011. ,Private Land ,Randolph,16,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13243,yes
1180,I feel pretty stupid reporting this now after some time has passed  but I felt like someone should hear about this. Back in May 1998  I  had taken my first trip to the North Georgia Mountains  specifically the Tallullah Gorge area. After hiking to the bottom of the gorge I hiked  to another local area near a lake called Lake Rabun and I viewed some water falls called Minnehaha Falls. The sun was already setting and when I completed the fairly easy stroll to the falls I noted that I was the only person at the falls. I did not observe anything weird at that time  but I did catch a whiff of something smelly in the area. Not quite the smell of a dead animal  but the smell of something very musty and almost sweaty. I stayed until it was completely dark and I fished my flash light out of my backpack. As I finished my ham sandwhich  I began to get up off the ground to hike out. It was at this time I noticed a figure of what I thought was a person squatting to the right of the falls in some bushes. I thought it was another hiker I had either failed to see sitting there or someone who had arrived after me. I did not turn my light on yet and I did not want to turn it on so as to blind the other person. I began to walk in the direction of the other person to say hello and that is when it stood up and I could obviously tell the thing was about 9 to 10 feet tall. I still thought it was a very tall person until I got to within 20 feet of it and the smell became extremely bad. I could hear the thing breathing shallow and it kind of sounded like when a person has a chest cold with some gurgling or rattleing in the chest. I stopped and turned my light on and tried to shine it on the thing  but it began to turn away from me as it took very long strides as it walked on two legs. It was dark brown in color and had matted hair covering it  s body. It stopped and turned towards me from about 60 feet away and took about 5-6 steps towards me in the bushes. I became scared and drew my service pistol from my fanny sack (I am a police officer) and stood my ground while yelling at it to stop. It stopped and then turned away. The creature walked away without turning back. I left the area and drove back to my apartment in Marietta Georgia. I did not tell anyone about this  as I thought they would think I was crazy or lying. ,Minnehaha Falls is 1.6 miles from the Lake Seed Dam.

1181,I am reporting and writing this on behalf of my step father-in-law (f-i-l). This incident occurred with he and my brother-in-law (b-i-l)in 1984 or 1985 (he is not sure of the year since so much time has passed). He and my b-i-l were deer hunting in the fall on some old growth hardwood/pine forrest near where my f-i-l was raised. They had drove into the area  parked  then separated to go to their respective hunting areas (he up hill about 100 yards from the vehicle and my b-i-l about 100 yards down away fromt the vehicle in a bottom area). As they met back at their vehicle  my b-i-l related that he had come across a deer carcass that was torn apart (limbs appeared  ripped  from the trunk and the trunk torn open). He had never seen anything like it. They hiked back to the area and to the carcass and had to push physically push through some thick growth to the site of the carcass. My f-i-l related that the kill was fresh  no more than 24 hours old at the oldest as there was no decay  had not been scattered by scanvengers  and it was too fresh to have maggots hatching. While looking  he related that he began to have a strong feeling of being watched and began to smell something that was a combination of a wet dog and rotting garbage. As it was getting dark  they headed back to their truck. He said the truck was about 100 yards away and as they walked  he noticed the sound of something walking parallet to themabout 10-15 yards into the undergrowth. As they reached the truck (they had both unloaed their guns earlier)  something in the underbush less than 10 yard away he estimated   screamed  at them. He related that he had heard peacocks  deer  bobcat  etc while growing up and while hunting. and this was like nothing either of them had ever heard. Both of them are avid deer and turkey hunters with primitive weapons and firearms and have spent a great deal of time in the woods. The sound was so strange and unnerving that he said the hair on his arms and neck stood up. They both fumbled with their guns trying to reload and to get in the truck as it was almost full dark by then. They immediately left the area as fast as possible. My b-i-l passed away in 1999 and to my knowledge  I never remember or know of him telling anyone else about this. My f-i-l took me back out to the area on Saturday  Jan. 13  2007. This was the first time he had been back since the incident occurred. He related that he could close his eyes and still hear that scream and he could feel his hairs standing up. We walked the area but it has been clear cut for timber and is now leased to a hunting club (Inland Paper is the land owner) and a gate has been put up so that you have to walk to the area where the incident occurred. The area is in the nw part of the county very close to the Alabama state line. There is no one living close to this area still  there is running water  a large deer population going by the tracks we saw and scat  as well as good cover provided by timber piles and second growth forest returning. My f-i-l had never told this story to anyone else until he heard me telling some other family members abou going on the GA 2006 expedition. He then told me later while we were alone with no other family members present. ,I have marked gps coordinates for the area. ,Polk,36,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13233,yes

1184,Last year during the summer my wife and I were leaving work. We were riding together in my car leaving the Cedartown Ga airport where we skydive. It was about 7 00 7 30 in the evening the sun was starting to set  not dark but getting there. We were driving down Old Rockmart Rd headed to Rome Ga where we live. Old Rockmart Rd is the back way home about 15 miles long surrounded by woods  trees  fields  and pastures. My wife and I were talking back and forth about the day just driving home. Its starting to get dark and as we come to a straight away about a half a mile long with pastures on both sides of us fenced in  I see something big and black in front of us about 10 to 20 yards in my lane of the road I thought it was a cow so i slammed on the brakes at that time this figure (BIGFOOT) stood up from a crouched position standing about 8ft tall with long black hair turned and looked at us. I think the brakes squealing scared it  but it looked at us  the lights shined right on him. He covered his face from the head lights  he took about 2 steps into the side of the road where there was a fence post about 5 to 6 feet tall  put his left hand on the fence post and easily hopped over the fence and took off. Our windows were down  it made no sound plus couldn  t hear over the sound of the car. But I could smell something dead or garbage  it smelled bad. He was about 8 feet tall and way bigger than a cow. But this was not a cow  I know what I saw  he was on two feet walking and hopped a fence and ran toward the woods. I was shocked at what I saw and so was my wife. This is my second sighting of bigfoot in the same state about 40 miles from my first sighting. My wife and i were speechless for about 15min. I could see his face looked human but wasn`t  he was all black but face and hands looked like dark grey  his hair was all black long and matted  had dark eyes and very strong massive arms and legs. ,Old Rockmart Rd between Rome and Cedartown Ga off of Hwy 101 and Hwy 278. ,Polk,36,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13233,yes
1185,I was driving to work Friday  May 10. I twas approximately 6 15 EST. I had just cut off Hwy 278 at the Shilo Church road and had gone approximately 1 mile. It was light enough that I could see into fields  I was looking for deer which is my hobby while driving. The first field that I came to I began to scan it. There was something standing in the field about 30 yards from the road. It was around 8   tall. I could see the body and head  with the body extending down into the grass which is about 3   tall. By the time I stopped my truck  the figure was no longer there.

1186,I was asleep in my tent when something hit me. I woke up and realized that my tent was being bombarded by rock which I thought was being caused by one of my friends. I poked my head out of the tent because my buddy and I had forgotten to zip it. I looked around and I was about to pull my head back in when I saw a strange figure slightly in the brush staring at me. I yelled not knowing what to do and woke my buddy who was in my tent up. I proceeded to tell him what had happened and he didn  t believe me. In the morning we proceeded to get up and investigate. We found no foot prints but the brush had obviously been disturbed  there were also several stones by the side of both tents that seemed to have been thrown there. Although we had planned to stay another night  we left promptly after I shared my story with everyone. ,You can find it. Its a state run campsite. ,Rabun,3,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13241,yes
1187,I went to a favorite spot for the weekend to get some peace and quiet and hopefully a monster brown trout. Been going there for years fishing and camping. Not extremely remote but wild and beautiful none the less.Its actually an old home place that has long disappeared  nothing remains except the concrete foundation and a narrow overgrown road that was once the driveway.Was very cold the night before  mid 20s but the sun was shining bright and it was starting to warm up. I made the relatively short hike down the old road bed to my spot by the river.I dropped my pack against a tree and went down the step embankment to the rivers edge to check out the water and soak up some sunshine to warm up.After a few minutes I heard what I thought was another fisherman or someone up above me where the old foundation was.I thought  great so much for peace and quiet  must be hardcore trout fisherman like me to be here in cold weather . I walked back up the embankment expecting to see people   what I saw in broad day light  probably 30-40yds directly in front of me was what I can only describe as what appeared to be a fully erect gorilla  except his face didn  t protrude out it was flatter and the hair was the color of a squirrel  browns  black  silver & a slight tint of red when the sun reflected off him.He was standing there  head slightly tilted back  squinting his eyes soaking up the sunshine  just as I was.I couldn  t comprehend what I was looking at at first. My first thought was  what am I looking at? .. Second thought was  God look how big he is . It was incredibly muscular  at least 4ft wide at shoulders  7-8ft in height massive animal. The skin was a dark grayish color around the face  head was extremely pointed  like a dunce hat almost  no neck large pectorals visible under the hair. Eye color was like a shade of amber. It was squinting in the bright sun  soaking up some warmth. He didn  t really see me at first I don  t think.I did kinda pop up over the embankment  I think he knew I was there but didn  t really know where .He could have been trying to smell me. I watched this massive beautiful animal standing there in the bright sun for probably 15-20 seconds.I had a feeling of amazement  wonder & actually privileged .I knew that what I was looking at was truly one of Gods immaculate creations. It was beautiful  big and scary as hell  but beautiful. Hair was clean  looked groomed almost. Very healthy animal. After 15-20 seconds of seeing this I actually stepped up over the embankment all the way in view and I said out loud something like  hey big boy ain  t you a pretty thing!  That  s when it finally saw me. It dropped its head down & froze. I could tell I surprised it. It wouldn  t make eye contact. I could see its whole posture change. It became very shy& acted like it was hoping that as long as it didn  t look directly at me I wouldn  t see him. It was like a bashful child.I took a few steps toward it and said  hey big boy   or something to that effect  and that was enough for him. He turned to his left and he was out of there. I could here the limbs & leaves rustling as he made his getaway. He moved like a deer going up the mountain  fast fast. Didn  t see him but I could hear him. After probably 5 seconds the rustling stopped and it was totally silent. Then I clearly hear what sounded like someone doing a drum roll with wooden sticks on a wooden table. Three  brat-tat-tat-tat  s very quick  very clear  definitely not a woodpecker. No doubt in my mind it was him. He had traversed the mountain side and was on the ridgeline above me in no more than 5-10 seconds. Unbelievable. I never felt threatened  never felt afraid. Was a feeling of privilege & respect. I set up camp and stayed at that spot for the night and all the next day but never saw it again.   spent most of my life in those mountains walking feeder creeks backpacking  fishing for brook trout.Thought I knew all there was to know.That day changed my life. Made me not only question my sanity & eye sight  (I  m not crazy & have 20/20 vision)  but my understanding of the natural world .Ive been back several times but haven  t seen him. ,West fork chatooga river ,Rabun,3,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13241,yes
1188,The year was 1965 while my father a military NCO Basic Training Instructor  was stationed at Ft. Gordon Georgia.  We were living on the base at the NCO old housing area.  There had recently been built a new housing area but we lived in the old Army barracks converted to housing where four families were accommodated to live in a barracks of four apartments.  There were more barracks converted to housing in the same area and woods to the left of the housing that led to some old infantry fields no longer in use of dense pine trees.  Near these woods  there were two barracks of Military Police units. One day  the girl from the apartment below informed me that her little brother would tell her that a big man would look through their window at night.  The little boy would observe the man looking into the room.  To the both of us  this seemed amazing since the window bottom ledge of the barracks where we lived was about 7 or 8 ft. from the ground.  It would be impossible for any normal size human being to look into the window from that height.  I paid no attention to it and soon forgot the story. During the summer vacations  I would enjoy venturing into the woods next to the housing area with my friends.  We would go downwind and get as close to deer as possible just to take a photo or observe the animals without disturbing them.  I remember one morning my friends were not around so I decided to go and venture the woods by myself.  As I walked down the slope into the woods and began walking on level ground just about 200 hundred yards at the edge of the woods  I noticed that a bulldozer had just scraped the land next to the Officers Housing area.  The Army was going to make a new housing for the Officers in that part of the woods.  I also noticed on the red clay of the ground some big footsteps that came from the Officers Housing into the edge of the woods where I was walking into. The last footsteps that lead into the woods from the red clay were so enormous that I began to observe them.  I noticed they were of a person walking barefoot  at least 18 inches in length and about 5 inches wide.  The person or whatever it was that had made the prints had a total of 5 toes.  I had never heard of Bigfoot and just thought it was some big person walking around barefoot enjoying the mud (red Clay). I then went into one of the many trails that led into the woods and after a few minutes  something seemed not to be right.  I did not hear birds nor did I see any squirrels.  Everything seemed to be silenced.  I could only hear the wind blowing and the trees moving in the wind but no sign of life in the area.  This began to give me what you call the goose bumps as if someone or something was watching all my moves.  I then sat on a big rock nearby and observed everthing around me and at the same time kept my ears opened.  Just a few moments went by when I started to hear some heavy bi-pedal footsteps in the grass and leaves near me at about 50 ft. of distance from where I sat.  The grass was very high and there was lots of brush that did not allow me to see more than 20 ft. into the brush area.  I guess you can say that my human nature or animal instinct just took over me  telling me to get out from there as fast as possible.  I did not waste any time  but controlled my self not to go into panic. I steadily began to walk out of the woods and as I did  I could hear the heavy bi-pedal footsteps stalking me from the left  deeper in the woods from where I was at.  If I stopped walking  it would stop walking.  If I ran a little  it would run a little.  I also became aware that whatever it was  would stop walking just a few seconds after I did.  In other words  it would stop and begin to walk as I did.  As I got closer to the edge of the woods at the red clay area  whatever was in the woods began to run very fast coming towards me.  I then thought it was time to run like hell.  I picked up a running speed that surprised me.  When I finally got back to the housing area  I was exhausted trying to get my breath back again and sat on the porch in front of my home.  A friend that lived across the street had observed me and asked what had scared me.  He said he saw me running out of the woods as if my butt was on fire.  This got me a little upset and when I finally got all my breath back  I explained the ordeal to him.  He just stood there and laughed at me.  Since he did not believe me  I made him a challenge to go into the woods with me where I had heard the footsteps.  He accepted the challenge and we both returned to the area.  While walking down the path near the Officers Housing area  I showed him the footprints in the red clay.  He observed them leading into the woods and said to me that the prints must be those of the Bigfoot monster.  I had never heard of it and told him monsters don  t exist  it must be some big hillbilly or hobo person living in the area that does not want us to disturb him.  We both went into the same trail I had went into before and sat on the same rock.  Shortly after  the same weird sensation got over us.  There was a total silence and only the wind and trees moving in the breeze could be heard.  Suddenly  the heavy bi-pedal footsteps once again began to stalk us in the brush as it did when I was by myself.  I told my friend to walk a little ways and then to stop.  As we stopped walking  whatever was stalking us would also stop.  When I looked at my friend  he seemed to have changed in skin color to almost a tomato red.  I knew he was more afraid than I was at the moment.  I then told my friend to stop once again and listen to our stalker getting closer.  As we stopped  heavy footsteps began to run towards us.  We could hear the brush breaking and moving.  When I turned around to tell my friend that it was time to start running  he had already begun his run and had about a 40 ft. lead on me.  I did not waste time to look back and ran as close as I could to my friend.  When we got back to the housing and sat on my porch trying to get our breaths back  he said he had seen something big that moved in the brush.  He was not certain what it was. To date  I know it was the Bigfoot creature because of the footprints I had observed earlier in the red clay.  I did not smell anything peculiar because we were down wind from it.  We did not hear anything except maybe a heavy breathing if I could remember correctly and the brush and grass moving about as it came towards us.  I will never forget the experience and because of it  I am especially interested in Bigfoot. ,The wooded area adjacent to the new NCO military Housing and next to the Officers housing just down a slope area.

1189,While preparing to check inside the brush that ringed the stream inlet area  a large man/ape creature 10   to 10  6  tall (estimated weight 1100 lbs.) approached me with an unhurried pace at a distance of approximently 20 feet. The body except for the Face and Palms of the hands were covered with  neat short (one inch)dark brown to black hair flecked with gray hair.  The attitude was not especially threatening. It was more like a positive defensive move.The face was rather like a Gorilla(Dark skin and Dark deep set eyes  the head sloped back and was neanerthal shaped  had no eyebrows prominent lips but not protruding  jutting square chin  no ears or teeth were seen prominent nostrils slight nose (not flat like a gorilla) and an aged look to the face. The body was all big boned muscle  no body fat and had thick arms and legs. It made no vocal sounds and I did not notice any odor.

I have yet to get in touch with the witness  J.N. that saw the creature. Here are a few extra notes  Tim Chitwood (reporter) heard the story from a Sheriff  s deputy in Russell County. The incident happened on August 30. The call to 911 was made at 10 54 pm. J.N. never called a Game Warden as the story stipulates. He called 911 from the Quick Stop in Fort Mitchell  AL. No report was filed with any police agency due to the fact that the witness was not willing to go back to the camping area with an officer. On the 911 tape the witness did state that  it  walked upright. The women at the Quick stop would not give their names  but stated they saw the dog  and it looked okay  they didn  t see any blood. Apparently  the dog had walked off from the camp site and started making strange noises. The women did concur on the fact that the witness was  scared as hell  when he came in. The witness told them that it was taller than himself  and he saw the silhouette and the eyes as it kept moving towards him. The camp ground where this occurred is named after an old plantation owner who owned the land. It is also known for it  s Indian Mounds. The mounds are not burial sites  but foundations for the dwellings the Indians lived in. (circa 1000 AD-1500 AD).  Sheky Bean  is the name the locals have given to whatever is wandering around the area. ,Rood Creek Park just south of Florence Marina. ,Stewart,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13259,yes
1191,Myself  an infantry squad leader  and two other squad leaders  with 2 privates  were assigned to do a recon of another unit a few miles away. We did not have time to decide a route. As it was getting dark we set out with a map and compass. Our route took us through near chest deep swamp for several hundred meters. We came out of the water probably about a mile from the other unit. Shortly after exiting the water we could hear something or someone following us. We thought maybe it was our instructors  but then decided it couldn  t be. No one in their right mind would have followed us through the water and no one knew the route we took. Although we didn  t see it  it was easily within 25 yds. It would come up behind us. When you would expect to see it  it would cut off to the right or left  go around us  fade off  and then we would hear it coming again. This went on for 10 or 15 minutes. Wanting to see it we tried to trick it by having Sgt. W. and Pvt. P. sit tight and the rest of us would move out slowly  then in 5 minutes they would pick up and move out. The thing started weaving in and out of the two groups like in a figure-8. Then we couldn  t hear it anymore. We met up a couple of hundred yards later with the other 2 soldiers and they said the same thing -- that it came between the 2 groups  around them  toward us  like it knew exactly where we were even though we couldn  t see it. Later about 400 meters from our objective we set in a patrol base and decided we would conduct the last phase in 2 man teams with myself and Sgt. H. going first  Sgt. W.  Pvt. P. and Pvt. S.  staying at the patrol base until our return in a couple of hours  at which time 2 others of the patrol would go out. This is when it got really wierd  we were about half way to the objective when we heard something following us again. We got to the opposite side of a somewhat open area and laid down facing the direction of the noises. Probably 5 minutes passed and all of a sudden this scream-roar is the only way I can explain it. We looked at each other and I said  what the hell was that .  We had never heard anything like that before. About a minute later it screamed again and then we heard what sounded like a huge rotten tree falling  and brush breaking. That was the last we heard and the last I wanted to hear. A little about myself  27 yrs. old at the time  from the mountains of WV   combat veteran  hunted small and large game since 8 yrs. old.

I haven  t told very many people of this in fear of being laughed at.

1192,Walking on my creek in West Central Georgia which I visit almost daily  bass fishing. Watching 2 geese with their babies  all of the sudden they all flew off and I started to get this really weird feeling like something was watching me. Turned around to walk back up the creek and heard a huge chrashing in the brush across from me and I stood still thinking it was a wild hog which has tried to attack me in the past. Started looking and couldn  t get any really visible detail but saw what I am estimating as a 7 foot creature in the brush. I hollered at it and it backed up and completely dissapeared. Needless to say I got out of there. ,I will gladly send in a e-mail but don  t want to give out my fishing spot. ,Troup,2,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13285,yes
1193,I was hiking the Appalachian Trail in July of 2005 and I stopped to spend the night at the Gooch Mountain shelter.   There was a hiker there at 16 00 but he left around 18 00 to get in a few more miles. It was a normal night on the AT until around 2 30 in the morning. I was awakened by a very heavy rustling sound. I immediately jumped up in the sleeping bag thinking it was a bear. I was sleeping in the loft upstairs  for just this reason  and I had seen a bear earlier that day. When I shined my headlamp out the front of the shelter there came a tremendous whooping sound. It was a mmoooooopp. It was pitch dark and dead silent except for this tremendous whoop. I was almost painful to the ears it was so loud. I could not see anything. The sound seemed to be about 50 feet away and moved from left to right out of range of my headlamp repeating this loud whoop. There were no other sounds in the woods  nothing  not even the crickets or frogs until 3 or 4 minutes after the sound stopped. I did not sleep the rest of the night. I looked in the morning and found no evidence of a bear  raccoon  or other animal  but the ground was very hard and dry. The sound came from the area where I had my food hanging in a tree away from the shelter. I am a big guy  ex-military and spend a lot of time hiking and surviving in the woods. I have never heard anything close to this sound from any animal I have ever encountered. I do not scare easy but this had me really shaken. I watched a show on The Discovery Channel (I think) a while back and they played a supposed recording of a Bigfoot  then I realized this was exactly what I heard. Until that time I had dismissed the event. ,Gooch Mountain Shelter ,Union,14,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13291,no
1194,My girlfriend and I traveled to this area at 11 30 that night to build a campfire and relax from the daily grind. She and I didn  t have to work Wednesday  so the late hour didn  t matter.  At about 11 30 we found a suitable site  appr.7-8 miles in. There are only a dozen or so clearings for camping on the trail. Our site was on the trail  a clearing big enough to circle my truck around. It had two other trails at the back corners. One didn  t go far before growth took over. The other looked like it might be passable  as far as I could tell. At 1 a.m. I was sitting on the tailgate and my girlfriend a few feet away tending the fire. Then we heard a loud high-pitched scream that reverberated through the dense forest. My girlfriend got scared and asked me what it was. I have been an outdoorsman my whole life  hunting  fishing  camping  and studying animals like a religion. I  ve never heard anything like that scream. I told my girlfriend to be quiet  maybe it would go off again. The moon was high and bright to be not full yet. The trail was lit good  so i looked down the trail and i looked the way we came. In the middle of the trail a large  bulky figure stood! The way the light fell on its features I believe it was facing me from about 30 yards distant. I thought at first it might be a tree or bush  but it had a discernable head  arms  torso  and legs. I went and got my girlfriend  not saying anything to upset her. If it turned out to be a tree  she would be mad for teasing her. I looked and the figure was gone! Back at the fire the   animalâ€™ behind us screamed same as before  except this time it sounded just inside the forest cover. Before we could react a similar  more distant call came from the forest in front of us. Was this the thing I had seen? I don  t know. At that I threw everything in the truck at my girlfriend  s panic. I shoveled sand onto the fire while she screamed hurry! I jumped into that truck and hit out a lot faster than we drove in! ,Rocky Lane  Pidgeon Mtn near LaFayette  GA. In Walker County this dirt & gravel road is approx. 13 miles long.

1195,Hi me and my friend have been hearing some weird stuff while we are hunting. My friend heard the sonds first. Then I heard them the next evening right before dark. The sounds sound like something screeming. But kind of high pitched screems. My friend also thought he heard somthing throwing stuff around his treestand. The reason I think it is a bigfoot is because there is some property behind ours  and they have been clearcuting all of it. I think it has run the bigfoot on to our property. If I see or hear any thing else I will send you more info  but from what I have already heard I think it is a bigfoot.  ,Take Hwy 136 West from LaFayette  GA.

1196,Two friends of mine and myself were pushing a cave lead in Cornfield Sink on the east side of Pigeon Mountain. We came out of the lead at about 3 00AM and started gathering our caving gear together for the 1/2 mile walk to the car. As we are about to leave the strangest call I have ever heard came from the opposite side of the sink from us. Distance would have been about 900  . The three of us have been woodsmen all our lives but none of us had ever heard a call like that. It sounded like four different animals in one. All powered by what must have been an enormous set of lungs! Hearing the vocalization the three of us looked at each other saucer eyed not saying a word. Each of us was hoping the others would pipe up with a logical explanation for what we had heard. Needless to say since we had been planning to leave anyway we beat a hasty retreat to the vehicles. ,Cornfield sink 2000   SSW of the Blue Hole 3 miles NE of Rocky Lane ,Walker,13,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13295,no

1198,I will try to explain what I saw while returning home from a day of walking in a clear cut looking for Indian artifacts. The clear cut was located at the foot  of the southeast end of the Horse range mountain near Loudesville campground In White county Georgia. I was driving on a forestry service road  when  I saw what at  first I thought that was a  Bear  about 200 yards away.  But when I stopped  and watched it. I saw that it was not. It walked upright with a slight stoop for about 75 yards down a hill toward a small creek that was bordered by trees and brush . The road crossed the creek so I thought if I went on down the road I could see it as it came out the other side  but it did not come out and I did not get of out of the Bronco to go looking for it. I did not hear any sound and to be honest I did not tell any body about it for years until I told my Son Eric. Who contacted you.  ,It was off of a Forest service road near Alt. 75 ,White,16,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13311,yes
1199,I have a personal experience that would like to relate. I would hesitate to call it an encounter because it was dark and from an undetermined distance. Somewhere between 30 - 50 yards and it was on an elevated plane to us. Just outside of Helen off of s.r.75 north of the Upper Chattahoochee River Recreation Area. If you go to the top of the mountain north of the park clearing thats where my experience was. I had my first experience there in the year 1990. While a group of 5 friends and I were walking late at night we saw something on a near by ridge it stood up clearly visible but only as a sillouette in the moon light and jumped a very large distance. It then seem to stride over the back side of the ridge away from us. It was actually very quiet it didnt make a sound before we saw it stand and we didnt hear it land or stride away  as if it was stalking or observing us! Of course we were all extremely scared after seeing it initially. Again it was at night  and far away so we couldnt get a clear description. But we all saw it and were all struck with a panic like fear! I also went back with my dad who is a very harsh skeptic in the summer of 2006. We did not  see  anything but I had noted a couple of other things at this later date it was summer. First there was a very strong odor that seem to hang in a centralized area the entire weekend. Secondly the park rangers came by to tell us that the night before in the same place we were camping the last people left food out went into town after night fall and returned to find the camp completely ransacked so we needed to pack our food up or better yet keep it in the vehicles back on the road. They said the bears were forageing and getting brave because of the onset of the drought. Again no sightings but interesting because nobody actually spotted the  bear  either! And lastly along the mountain road at a heigth of 9-10 feet off the ground there was a 4 inch sappling rung and twisted completely around! My dad once spent 3 months in the woods living off the land in the late seventies in north Georgia. Its the number one reason he is skeptical he says that long in the woods and he would have seen something if it was out there. But when I noticed the odor and asked him if it was skunk  he said no not really  more likely a wet bear that got sprayed by a skunk but it had a more dank odor than just skunk. And also when I pointed out the rung tree and asked him what could have possibly caused that he had no clue!  I work in agricultural marketing. My job is to determine the amount of meat that will be derived from individual cow carcasses after slaughter and before they are split into primal cuts. To determine this we have to compare the confirmation of the animal or the ratio of muscling to fat and factor in the skeletal structure of the animal. So if I apply this to what I remember seeing when I was younger this creature was absolutely huge at least 8 feet tall and weighing easily 550 pounds! It was tall but had a slightly more narrow build in shoulder area width than the animal in the Patterson film. It was still too large to be human  wider and thicker muscled than a man but not as stocky as the Patterson footage  that is why I say it may not be heavier. ,Poplar Stump Rd.

1200,In May of 1993 Some of my friends of mine and I decided to go trout fishing above Helen  Ga.. After fishing for a couple of hours one guy and I decided to go upriver to find some new spots. So we started walking up an old roadbed that followed along the river. We eventually got to a spot where ther was a gully across the road  at one time there must of been a bridge. While me and my friend were standing there we heard a loud thud behind us. As we turned around there was a big ten foot log (about the diameter of a car tire) laying there. Take into acount just a second ago that log was not there. We climbed over the log and started to head back down the road when all of a sudden we heard leaves shuffling above us. Both my friend and I had a strange feeling as we looked at eachother. At the same time we bothe looked up above us and there was a Bigfoot standing 10-15 feet from us. We halled ass out of there. We finally made it back to where our other friends were  and told them what happened. They wanted to go see  the guy that was with me said no and went back to the vehical. I took the other two guys to show them  and on the way there we saw a footprint in the mud that looked like someone walking barefoot except it was appro. 18 inches long.  We walked back up and saw nothing else. Now I am 6  3  and 290 lbs.  and this thing dwarfed me bigtime. It was at least 9 feet tall and about 4 feet across at the shoulders. It had to way around 800 lbs.  It really looked like a big human covered in long shaggy black hair. The thing that got me was its reddish brown eyes. It took years for me to go back up there fishing  and when I did I would not go alone. It is wierd cause sometimes when up there you feel safe  but other times it feels like something is watching you. Since then I have heard wood knocking  vocalizations  and had rocks thrown at me. I do not hesitate to go up there anymore  but I will not go alone. ,the upper hooch ,White,16,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13311,yes
1201,It was on thanksgiving night in 99. I was driving home from my daughters apartment in Cleveland Ga. When suddenly I thought I saw a man crossing the road on hwy. 75. I hit my brakes and realized that it was wearing no clothes and was covered in hair like a bear  but it walked upright and hunched more like a man or a huge ape like thing. It was definately not a bear. It was large and long armed. It turned it  s head and looked over at me  then swiftly jumped down a huge drop and dissappeared into the woods. It all happened so fast. I was shocked and went home not sure of what i believed i had  seen at the moment. Before then I had never been sure something like that had existed and I tried to rationalize what I had seen  but now I am convinced that it was in fact neither man nor bear nor simple ape. I cannot prove what it actually was  but I can say that it was quite amazing. Either that night or the next morning I callerd Animal Control saying I saw a bear  believing that it wouldn  t be taken serious if i said what i know I saw. There were cattle near by that needed protection. ,it was near Duncan Bridge  between the turn off for that road and Hwy. 17. ,White,16,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13311,yes
1202,It was June 15 1997  Father  s Day.  My friends and I had been rock climbing at Raven Cliff Falls in the Chattahoochee National Forest outside of Helen  Georgia.  After climbing all day Friday and Saturday morning  a rain storm made us pull down our rigging and head out of the woods.  We drove down to Helen and walked around until around 5 00 pm.  We filled up the truck and headed back up towards Raven Cliff to find a camp site for the night.  We found a small dirt road that had been barricaded with a large dirt birm.  We drove over the birm and drove into the forest.  We drove until we had a half tank of gas which put us several miles back in.  Around 11 00 or 11 30 pm  we found a small clearing and decided to stop and make camp.  Once we exited our truck  we found a shallow hole that was about three to four feet in diameter that appeared to be an old fire pit.  It had a large log laying on one side of it.  We gathered wood for a fire and began to set up camp.  Since the weather was nice  we decided to not to mess with tents and hammocks.  After about thirty minutes of laying down  I heard a noise in the tree line on the left side of our camp.  It sounded like an animal moving through the brush.  I dismissed it and tried to go back to sleep.  I continued to hear the noise for several minutes.  I have spent alot of time in the woods hiking and camping.  The next thing I heard was like nothing I had ever heard before.  I heard a grunt and then a scream that did not sound like any other animal.  It sounded like it came from maybe fifty to a hundred yards away.  I asked what it was and my friends did not have an answer.  We began kidding saying that we were out a good way and it could be a sasquatch.  I did not go to sleep for awhile after the scream.  Finally  I drifted asleep and slept until day break.  As we got up to get our gear packed  we noticed prints next to the fire pit that none of us had ever scene before.  They definitely were not human  but were to big for any animal known to be in indigenous to that area.  We quickly loaded up and left the area. ,The dirt road was on the left hand side of the road before you get to the trail head of Raven Cliff Falls.

1203,I was sitting on my couch watching tv with my small dogs around me. My male Yorkie saw it when I did out our back door. It was sitll daylight. I thought it was a man at first  but it was too large  too dark  and fleeting. The dog jumped up and ran to the back door but I moved slowly over there  being a little frightened. When I looked out the door it was gone. My first impression of it being a man was because of the general shape  but the dark figure wasn  t wearing clothes and had to be over 10ft. tall to see it through the dorway like I did. I was able to see the upper body from where I was sitting. The porch drops off with a stairway to the patio around the pool. That  s where it was walking rappidly next to the house. By the time I got to the door to look out it was over the fence and gone. My instinct was to check the gate and I saw it was still latched and locked  never having been opened. It wasn  t a human it was too large. It wasn  t a bear it was running upright. I can  t come up with any other thing that could be that tall and that could do what it did. And having seen what I sawe in 1999 I don  t take this lightly. ,my backyard ,White,16,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13311,yes
1204,It was about 11pm and we just laid down to sleep. We were staying in a cabin that we had rented for the weekend. I heard this high pitched horrific scream/howl. It was close. It was not some faint  distant sound. It was very clear and close. My first thought was a woman in distress. Then  about 20 seconds later  I heard it again. I also heard dogs barking above me  higher up the ridge. This time I realized it was probably not a human. This sound was a forceful  deliberate  high pitched reverberating scream/howl. Because I was inside the cabin  it is hard to tell how far away this was. I would guess within 750 feet. Perhaps as close as 200 feet. The scream/howl continued about four/five more times  repeating about every 15-25 seconds. I have military and hunting experience and have never heard such a sound. I cannot think of an animal that could make this type of sound. I will never forget it  that  s for sure. ,Go through Helen. Turn left on Alt. 75  just past flea market.

1206,My husband and I live in Sautee  Ga.  just outside of Helen. My husband can  t sleep very well at night and as such he is up at all hours. For about the last three weeks he has heard strange sounds late at night. He has got me up several times to listen. Whatever we are hearing is not anything we have heard before. All of the dogs go crazy and whatever it is seems to move very quickly  attracting the dogs as it goes. It is very loud and it more of a howl or scream; it does not sound like a bobcat or bear or anything else we have heard since living in Northeast Ga. We have lived in this area for nine years and my husband has hunted all his life and is used to sounds in the night  just not this one. When he woke me up to hear this we jokingly said  maybe it  s a bigfoot . I got curious as to whether or not there had been any sightning in our area and found this website. After reading reports from this area I thought that maybe we had heard something out of the ordinary  hence the report. ,[Omitted] ,White,16,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13311,no
1207,Bigfoot sighting. Late March or early April  2009.  Approximately 1815 hours. I was southbound on GA75 between Helen and Cleveland  GA about .2 of a mile north of Duncan Bridge  (Hwy 384). As I rounded a bend I saw something getting ready to cross the road from east to west. As I slowed my first thought was that someone was dressed in a costume  but I dismissed that idea because every pickup around here had a shotgun in the back window and a good percentage  like myself  had a gun in the car. When he heard me he stopped on the shoulder. He did not look at me for a few seconds  but then slowly he turned toward me  looked  then continued to turn 180 degrees and walk into the woods. I was unable to pull off to the shoulder and park because of hay bales and plastic used to stop erosion.  Traffic was backing up behind me so I drove to Duncan Bridge then left on a private road  with the hope of seeing him again. No luck. What I saw. He appeared to be 6 foot 2 to 6 foot 4. He was standing erect but had a slightly hollow chest. His legs and torso seemed normal (as compared to a human) but his arms were longer. His fur was full and sleek. It had a shine to it. A medium to light brown. He looked healthy. It was his eyes that I remember most. He looked at me with an  intelligence that you don  t see in an animal. The only other time I experienced that was with a dolphin. I contacted DNR the next day. They had not received other sightings. I know the lady that submitted your . I called her and we compared notes. Even though the two sightings were only .2 miles apart  seems like a different animal. ,About .2 miles north of Duncan Bridge (Hwy 384) ,White,16,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13311,yes
1208,I lived in Burnt Hickory Estates off of Hwy 61 in a 2 story house with my mother  sister  step-father. We had over 125 acres in the back yard nothing but woods. The woods were covered in trees and little creeks. Me and my friends always played in the woods. For years we would find crazy things out there that just didn  t make sense like trees bent over and I remember a big hole like 20 feet deep maybe 40 feet wide round. We called it the hole. Well we decided to transport our horses behind our house so we cut down about 4 acres of trees  leveled it off and built a barn and fenced the area in. About 5 months later after everything was built and finished I would get bored and I would go in the pasture and hang out with the horses  feeding them just hanging out. I have 3 horses  Rambo  a Tennessee Walker  all black and 17 hands high. Reno  a Blanket Apaloosa  grey/white  12 hands high. And Dakota  a Morgan red tone  13 hands high. I was in the pasture standing by my horses Rambo and Reno. The pasture had a barn in the far back  in the right corner.  As I  m standing by Reno and Rambo I heard some movement in the brush to my right. To the left of the barn about 40 yards from me as I turned and looked  my horses Reno and Rambo spooked and ran toward my house away from the barn. As I look at this thing  I could only see the left front side of it facing me  hidden in the brush. The color was a red auburn. I thought  what is Dakota doing? Then I realize this thing is outside of the fence. I thought Dakota got out so as I walk toward what I thought was my horse  Dakota. At that time  Dakota runs out of the barn beside me and runs to the house. At that point I froze and the hair stood up on my neck. This up-right walking figure stepped to its left  made a grunt sound/breathing  looked right at me then turned pushing small trees and brush over and taking off into the woods. It was about 8 1/2 feet tall  massive in size and covered in red hair. The thing I call Bigfoot was ripped  very strong. As it took off you could hear the foot steps  very heavy. I ran towards the house and told my mom and everyone just looked at me like I was crazy. So I kept it to myself. This is my first sighting. Then about 9 months ago in 2012 I had another sighting. I  m about to write that sighting next. ,Off of Hwy 61 in Dallas Georgia in Paulding County. In Burnt Hickory Estates Stephen Court.

1209,it was autumn  and 4 or 5 of us decided to go camping. we went to the chattahoochee national forest in murray county ga.we had been there many times before  and seen many kinds of wildlife bear  deer  turkey and wild hogs. we set up camp and built a fire beside a creek. we sat there talking and telling stories and such. well around 11 oo p.m we started hearing strange noises like a high pitch shrill .someone in the group said it could be a panther since they have been known to scream. we sat there about another hour or so with the noises happening around every 20 minutes or so.then we heard limbs moving and twigs cracking from the other side of the creek. so we all looked that direction and just could make out the brush and trees at the edge of the creek. it sounded like whatever it was started getting closer.when all of a suuden we all seen limbs from the magnolia trees moving and out step this figure into the fire light.it took 2 more steps  then we all could plainly see it.it was around 6  5     or 7   tall with a huge broad chest maybe 3   wide. one of my friends got scared and dove into the tent and made a bit of noise but it didnt seem startled. it looked at us and then squated by the edge of the water. it appeared to be doing something with its hands all the while keeping a dead stere on us.then we all pretty much paniced  and it calmly stood up and walked out of distance of the light and our flashlights. ,near Cohutta Wilderness ,Murray,4,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13213,yes

We had a hand full of run ins with the sasquatch and his offspring.The first time we saw it was when it came up to my infant sisters window and she was mocking it I think it got confused one night and went to my moms window and started grunting and scared my mom so bad she tried to climb up under my dad he told her he thought it was probably a bear(that is until he saw it for himself)my mother went out to get the note off of the door and it was about ten feet at most away from her she ran back inside and when she was able to speak she told my dad what she saw my dad went into the bathroom and shot the larger one One night we had acetylene tanks being thrown around by the larger one  she said he was black hair from head to toe arms were past the waist line nose was not like a gorillas was more like human nose.We heard a noise outside one night and went out to look and found hair embedded into the wall of the outside of the house.It always came to the house at night It was very curious always looking into the windows my aunt heard something one night and ran so fast that she actually put an indention into the wall of the house.My dad said one night all of my uncles came over and they were looking around the house for it and one of my uncles yelled down from the roof of the house that my dad was leaning against it and when he turned around and looked up at it it got spooked and beat the hood of the jeep and destroyed it.In our area where we lived there was always goats and cows etc..found with their intestines gone no meat was eaten.It did always smell like a septic tank when it came around.We went outside the next day after an incident with it we went outside and our neighbor who owned cows had five cows laying on their sides dead with their insides gone next to the cow field where the pond was.Then when i was about fourteen years old we moved back to almost the exact spot we lived in when we had experienced it the first hand full of times we cleared the woods across from where we lived before so we could put the trailer on the property I was sleeping one night and thought my alarm went off i checked it and apparently it was some other noise that woke me up i looked out the window and saw an eight foot tall hairy creature running from my window my dad went outside right away and did a cast of the foot print.We had a friend who was a game warden when we lived in west palm florida who went out and and was recording what she thought was a bear she was in her vehicle out in the middle of the woods on the recording we heard a howl like sound that was unlike anything we have ever heard it sent chills up our spine and then it started shaking her vehicle side to side then it ran off. , ,Macon,11,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13193,yes
1211,I was assigned to Fort Stewart with my platoon during an NTC train-up.  The MP supervised road crossing of 144 (hard stand night road crossings at that time had to have MPs to manage the traffic) had been closed for the night leaving my platoon separated on the opposite side of the road from the Task Force and my company--we were told to stay put on the SE side of 144 until morning when we could cross without the MPs.  Since we had been down range for many weeks  we maintained radio contact  formed a herringbone in a clearing  but otherwise went admin and I let everyone sleep.  Most of the soldiers were turret lizards sleeping on top of their tracks.  Almost all had the ramp down (Not very tactical but we were smoked).  The weather was warm and sticky  typical for early Fall in SE Georgia.  Sometime during the evening as I and my platoon sergeant sat underneath a tree talking  we heard a terrible scream from our front  about fifty yards away inside the treeline.  I got up to walk toward the noise but my platoon sergeant stopped me.  The scream sounded like a woman being harmed  but there was a wildness to it as well.  At the time I assumed it was a panther (but have recently heard there is no extant recording a such a thing.  That and I drive past Woman Hollering Creek outside of San Antonio from time to time and am reminded).  There was nothing else.  The funny thing was when the scream finished  all the previously quiet armored vehicle engines started and the soldiers raised the ramps  climbed inside and went back to sleep. ,Near the post boundry on 144.

1212,The year was 1978 or 1979  opening day of deer season. We had set up camp the day before and later scouted for the right hunting spot. I chose an area within sight of water from Clarks Hill lake  with lots of deer sign. Saturday morning  opening day  I made my way to my tree stand around 5am a dense fog was beginning to roll in off the lake and with the darkness and fog  visibility was zero even with a flaslight. Before daylight  I began to hear screaming like sounds coming from an area above me  they seem to be getting closer as the mins went by  I was about 25 ft off the ground and still I was frozen with fear. I could tell the sounds were close  by the brushes and leaves making a noise and with a few mins I could hear it passed under my tree  I tried to shine my light but it was useless with the fog and darkness.Whatever it was  it continued on pass me still making those sounds. The fog lifted that morning and around 10 30  I saw one of the hunting camp buddys walking near my area  I whistled to let him know where I was and he walked over and begin to explain what he had heard that morning. I told him it had passed under me but didnt stop. We told our story to the other camp hunters but they had been in other areas and had heard nothing. I went back the following weekend and waited till the crack of daylight to walk to my stand. I didnt wont to meet this thing before daylight. Around 7 30 am  I killed a deer and went back to camp. My friend who had heard the sounds the weekend before came back to camp with matted hair he had found near his stand and when unrolled some of these were almost 20 inches in lenght. Several months later he told he had someone at the U of Georgia look at them and was told the were not horse or pig hair but without further testing they couldnt determine. The best of my memory it was dropped with out further checking. Thats been over 27 years ago and he has since died. ,I guess things have changes in the last 27+ years  It would take sometime for me to find the dirt road but I think I could ,Lincoln,16,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13181,yes
1213,Let me set up the story with some information that is pertinent to the situation. I was in the Army stationed at Fort Stewart  Georgia. My job at the time was as a gunner on a Bradley Fighting Vehicle. My unit was in the field conducting a training exercise which was to last a few days. The Bradley fighting vehicle is an armored tracked vehicle that normally has a crew of three; (Vehicle Commander  Gunner and Driver). One night around 2AM my vehicle was moving solo along a dirt road (we called them tank trails) in the northeast part of Fort Stewart. We were driving blacked out with no lights on. I was acting as gunner and had my head buried in the thermal sight system which is used to engage targets at night. The thermal sight distinguishes differences in heat signatures and formulates a picture in either white hot or black hot (depending on what you have selected) against a red background. The driver had the hatch closed and was using a night vision device to view the road. The vehicle commander was standing up out of the hatch looking through night vision monoculars. While moving along  if we encountered an intersection I would slew the turret either left or right (90 degrees) over the side of the vehicle to look down the road and clear it of any simulated enemy. At one particular intersection I did this maneuver   slewed the turret over the right side of the vehicle and looked down the trail. It was clear and the vehicle made a right turn. After turning we drove approximately one hundred yards. The vegetation was extremely thick in this area due to being a swamp and about 10-12 feet high. As I was looking through the sight I observed something come out of the vegetation  approximately fifty yards in front of us  from the right side of the road and walk across the road to the left and re-enter the vegetation. The dirt road is approximately 15-20 feet wide. This creature cleared the road in three steps at a normal stride. It didn  t seemed bothered by us or in a rush. I don  t recall it looking in our direction. Its head and torso were straight and it just walked on. Typically while looking through the thermal sight at a person you can distinguish clothing  hair  equipment they may be wearing  etc and be able to judge their height with the surroundings they are standing in. This creature appeared through the thermal sight to be one constant color from head to foot  have no clothes on and to be fairly tall  approximately 7-9 feet. The first thought that came to my head was a bigfoot. At the time it all just seemed to make sense. From watching documentaries and reading books as a kid it all seemed to fit.  Everything happened very quickly. I was shocked when I saw it and said nothing till after it went back into the woods. I announced to the vehicle commander over the internal comm system that something just walked across the road and it wasn  t a man or an animal. He got spooked and told the driver to punch it. I wanted to stop and investigate but no one else was having that. We were never able to go back and now I could only vaguely point out a general area we were in. ,North east part of Fort Stewart in a training area. Surrounded by Highway 119  144 and I-95 This area is relatively swampy with thick vegeation in most parts. Occured on a dirt road. Would have to look at a map of Ft. Stewart to show close to exact area. ,Liberty,13,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13179,yes
1214,I have 2 reports within 2 weeks of each other. 1st I was at a friends house with my brother and 3 other friends in Lee County Georgia on the Kinchafoonee Creek just off of century road.It was around the end of july 1992. It was about 45 minutes after dark we were standing out in the driveway close to the road away from the house. you could see the front of the house real good because of the night light right in front of the house.where we stood was dark being away from the light.As we talked we noticed something come around the right side of the house the only way to come from the direction it came was to cross the creek that bordered the back yard. At first we thought it was someone then we realized it was not a human when it walked right under the light heading toward the left side of the house. What I saw looked to be at least 8 ft. tall looked to be about 400-500 pounds  walking upright with a slight stoup or slump at the shoulders  but the shoulders were very wide coverd in hair. This to me was clearly not a bear as much as I have been in the woods I have never seen anything like this ever! We all five got real scared and jumped in the truck  which was facing towards the house.We watched it go around the house towards the left as it went it looked in the windows on that side of the house then it disapeared in the darkness.We tried to tell our parents what we saw but no one would belive us they tried to tell us it was a bear but we knew better. we  didnt file a report because of thinking no one would belive a bunch of teenagers. Experiance #2 A friend and myself were on Kinchafoonee Creek in Lee Co.between the bridge at HWY.32 walking up the middle of the creek fishing  towards Pinewood Rd.This area is covered in very thick woods on both sides of the creek with no houses around.I had told my friend about the bigfoot creature I had seen 2 weeks earlier on the creek who was not with me when we saw it. he said he belived me because he had heard about something like it before on the creek from stories around town. We walked for about one hr. when one of our other friends caught up with us. After about 45 mins somewhere around 1400hrs. we got the feeling like someone was following us wacthing everything we did  we even heard movement up in the woods like something heavy walking a few times but we passed it off as deer  being spooked. We then noticed a smell like something really needed a bath. we walked a little further to a sand bar as we got to it the smell got real strong. This is where we noticed what looked like very fresh really  big foot prints crossing the sand bar.This made us stop right there and head back very quickly for or vehicles. I never saw  anything  this time but I am positive this was another encounter with this creature. I STILL GET CHILL BUMPS BAD EVERY TIME I RETELL THIS STORY BECAUSE IT SCARED ME THAT BAD. TO THIS DAY I  HAVE NOT WALKED BACK UP THE CREEK LIKE THAT ANYMORE! ,#1-Heading North from ALBANY GEORGIA on Hwy 19 turn left on century rd. then turn right on cypress point  six houses down on the left. #2-Heading north on Hwy 19 from Albany Georgia  turn left on Hwy 32 then stop at bridge and head up the creek. ,Lee,19,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13177,yes
1215,It was 2 35 in the morning on July 26  2006. I recieved a call from my dad which alone is very unusual to say the least. He started by saying  you are not going to  believe  what i just saw . He said he steped out onto his porch(which  wraps around his house) to sit in his chair and have a smoke. He got about half way through with it when he said he heard the most terrifying sound ever. He  stepped in the door and grabbed a MAG light to take a look and when he did he saw a sillouette of a bipedal creature approx 8 foot tall and 75 yards away stand up near the pond and quickly run towards the neibors house which is to the right and behind him. At this point my dad is completely freaked out. He hears the loud moan again 3 more times each time getting softer in the distance. He then wakes my mother (who thinks he just lost his marbles) and she comes outside with him. She also hears the moan and a gun shot approx the same distance away but at this point it is an estimatted 1 mile away. This is when  he calls me and describes what happened. I get in my truck and go overe to their house to take a look around with him. Whatever it was is long gone by the time i get there and we just look  around to put both  my mom and dad somewhat at ease. The  reason i am writing this instead of my dad is 1) he dont t know how to use a computer and 2) i felt a report needed to be  made and i doubt he would ever do it. I can  tell you that i have never seen or heard my dad so scared in my life. ,Approx 1.5 miles north on highway 135 out of lakeland ga ,Lanier,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13173,no
1216,My husband had told me about these woods that he grew up near that used to scare him as a boy.  He had not been to the woods in about 8 years and he thought that the incidents were scary just because he was a kid. We decided to go camping in the woods for the first time in 2006. It was in the winter time and the leaves were crunchy on the ground.  We went to the camp site where my husband used to camp and set up everything.  The camp site was about two football fields away from the main trail down in the valley.  We were on a sand bar that extended out into the water and there was only one trail in and out for this site. Right as it began to get dark it got very still and quiet. There were no birds  no dogs barking and we could not hear anything moving around.  We started cooking dinner and right when it got dark we heard the most horrifying scream that I have ever heard in my life.  The sound was so loud that I could feel it in my chest like someone was holding an air horn right out in front of me. We were bound and determined to stay the night so we just brushed it off as an owl or something. After the sound we could hear walking  very heavy two legged walking.  We did not know what to think so we just shrugged it off as a deer.  We decided to go to bed and get some sleep and just make it through the night.  As we were lying in the tent the walking got louder and then we heard a loud kerplunk in the water next to the tent.  We pushed it off as a beaver.  Then it did it again and we could not take any more so we decided to just grab some of our things and leave. As we were getting out of the tent we could hear the walking in front of us.  The thing was walking down our path towards us.  My husband had a 22 gun and decided to call out a bunch of warnings to make sure that it was not a person.  We had two high beam flashlights on the path and we saw eyes. They were big with no visible pupils  and they were green. My husband felt that we were in danger and decided to shoot three times at the eyes.  When he shot the thing walked towards us three steps and stopped.  I do not know about you but a normal animal will run when gun shots are fired at the close of a range (about 30 feet).  We got back to the camp site and felt trapped and helpless because we do not know how to get out of the woods with this thing in our path.  My husband ended up calling one of his high school friends that he had not spoken to in about 5 years to come and help us. Our friend came to our rescue and brought a bigger weapon and more lights.  From what my husband says the thing followed us out of the woods the entire way.  This story is one of about 6 so far. After that night our friends wanted to go out there to investigate so we went out there the next day and looked around. We could not find any tracks or hair but there were some trees and vines that actually formed a dome shape that a 6â€™ person could stand straight up in.  There were little piles of sticks under there and a spot flattened out big enough for a grown man to lie down on. The next night it was walking around us and it also knocked sticks together and screamed at us again and we left around 10 00pm that night and left the camping gear behind.  We have been out there about 6 other times and it is always there waiting for us so that it can scare us out of the woods again. Just to give you a little bit of a back ground on our witnesses.  We have had four law enforcement officers (including my husband)  an RN  me and our friendâ€™s wife.  I am telling you this because this is not a joke to us and it is very real.  My husband and his friends went to the woods about a month ago and got ran out again. , ,Lamar,4,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13171,no
1217,I had two squatches approach me after I had shot a deer in 2013. They didn  t come into view but I wasn  t trying to see as I was trying to field dress my deer and leave the area. They were yelling back and forth making sounds I haven  t heard in the woods in 35 yrs. They sound like a mix of a bull  a bull elk and a lion. No animal makes sounds like that in Georgia. I had also found many fresh tree breaks on my way to my stand site the day before. ,Piedmont nwma ,Jones,1,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13169,no
1218, ,The closest reference point I can give is Pennington Road and Hughes Road. I would have to ride back out that way and locate the property  but I  m sure that I could.

1219,It had to be July of 96  on a Sunday. It was the month of the  blue moon . Myself  a friend and my 17 year old son was going fishing at yellow jacket creek in West Point Georgia. I felt we needed to cut our all night fishing trip short  it was an urgent feeling I had  and knew we had to go. We were leaving the park about 12 00-1 00 A.M. There wasn  t any lights on the long road and we were the only ones out that time of night. We were in a Mitsubishi truck pulling a med size boat  needless to say  we couldn  t go too fast. I  d say about 20 to 25 miles and hour at best. My friend and I saw something in the headlights and shouted  a deer!  At first Bud (my friend) thought it was a deer   but I could tell it was much bigger and was slowing down to get a better look. He was approx. 8 feet tall and was about the color of a deer. He was walking upright with long strides  his arms hung down to his knees  and his head was extremely large. It looked to me like his head was bigger than it should have been. He had sharp pointy features and darker hair was on the top of his head and down the back of his neck  spreading across his shoulders to about the shoulder blades and fading out. The rest of his hair was lighter in color and was close to the skin  like a deer. He walked on the right side of the road and as we approched  he veered off the shoulder of the road and eased off in the ditch  where he reached up and grabbed a mimosa tree limb  pulled it down as if to hide his face from us. We both could see him from his shoulders down. I seen his ribs  the muscles in his hips and thighs  and legs  and partly his back. That  s when I seen the hair fade into short close hair. I remember in detail  his face was distorted almost  and darker. The cheek bones were almost spikey  (for lack of a better word). Bud and I don  t hate each other  but we are not the best of friends but he will verify everything  and  no  we were not drinking or doing drugs of any kind. It was a Sunday  and it was a full moon  the month of a blue moon. Bud said it had to be a werewolf for the longest  till I said it had to be bigfoot. ,Yellow Jacket Creek..... there is a little store at the entrance and it is about 1 to 2 miles to the lake... Bud could tell you more about the road numbers and names.  I can get Bud  s phone number for you to talk to him. You can call me if you  d like. Just let me know. I have tried off and on for the last few years to get some one and tell them what we saw  with no luck.  I tried to call a 1-800 # and it was no longer in service and had to let it go. But it DID happen and I know what I saw. There is also an elderly man in Tucker Ga. who as a young adult was hunting around Yellow Jacket Creek and he made his sister bring him to me  an hour  s ride  so we could talk about it. Said no one belived him and he was afraid to tell it. As we talked he started to cry. He had to be 80 at this time but said he remembered it in detail and was so glad that someone else had seen it  that he KNEW he wasn  t crazy. This stays on my mind and I hope to hear from someone. Thank you. ,Heard,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13149,yes
1220,My family has an 800 acre farm in Haralson County  GA.  Our farm is on the border of Paulding County  GA.  near the small  town  of Draketown (it  s more of a settlement than a town).  We typically spend about one weekend out of the month at our farm where we have a nice cabin (house).  The land consists of pasture (no cattle)  pines  hardwoods  swamp  and five pretty large lakes.  Whenever we are down there we go spotlighting at night to look at deer.  We don  t hunt the deer on our land and usually see 50-80 deer a night just riding around and looking at them.  Being only about 1.5 hours from Atlanta this area is EXTREMELY remote and secluded.  It  s all private land and not much activity occurs around there. During this past Christmas holiday there were 6 adults in our group in a Suburban riding down the dirt roads through our farm after a cookout at the cabin.  As we neared the main pasture near our barn where we feed corn to the deer we were puzzled to see a large herd of deer  flying  out of the pasture into the hardwoods.  This was shocking because they know that headlights mean new corn and they usually stand around waiting on the new feed.  As we rounded the bend that opens up into the pasture we saw a large   black   two-legged creature cross the dirt road  see our lights  and then turn around and enter the heavy pines it had entered the road from.  We have no idea what we saw and don  t have the time to really investigate  however  we know that it was at least as large as a large grown man  walked on two feet  had weired looking long arms  and didn  t show it  s face to us. It was uniformly black and couldn  t have had clothes on to look like it did.  It seemed surprised to see our lights round the bend but did not seem worried or in a hurry to get out of sight (though it did in about 3 seconds).  We rode around the loop we were on and came back to the point where we had the sighting and nothing had changed.  No deer  nothing.  We discussed this for several days and decided it had to have been a bear  but we all know that it couldn  t have been.  Considering the latest events within 10 miles of here we decided we should post this. , ,Haralson,2,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13143,yes
1221,It was the summer of 1975 or 76 not sure  as it has been so long ago.  I was 12 or 13 at the time when I  had 3 different encounters within about 2 weeksâ€™ time with something that I now believe to be Bigfoot. First incident happened one sunny afternoon when my neighbor and I had gone down to the creek behind his house to fish for what we called horny heads  little fish with horns on the top of their head.  We were one house over from his house and had been fishing in this deep hole for about 20 minutes when his dog Tiger started acting very strange.  Tiger was one of the meanest dogs I have ever known and not afraid of anything at all.  Well Tiger started running around in circles and whimpering  I looked at my neighbor and asked him â€œwhat was wrong with your dogâ€ and he said â€œhe did not know he had never seen the dog do that.â€  Well next thing we knew Tiger is tucking his tail between his legs and running all out for the house.  It was then that we heard from the hill behind us what I can only describe as what sounded like a lady being torn apart.  This was the most blood curling scream I have ever heard.  My neighbor and I dropped our polls and ran straight to the house.  Neither of us turned to see what was on the hill behind us.  When we got to the house we found Tiger under the house in the crawl space where he stayed for the next 3 days.  We could not get him to step foot out from there.  People said it might have been a bobcat or something like that but I feel certain Tiger would have chased after something of that nature. Incident number two.  The following week a different neighbor and I went down to Lake Knickerbocker  a small lake that is fed from the creek my other neighbor and I had been fishing on the week before.  We had ridden our bicycles down a small trail that goes from LeDan Road back to the lake.  It was again a sunny afternoon and we had fished for most of the morning without any luck so we had decided to pack it in  as we were headed back out on the trail we heard all these dogs barking and going crazy down the hill just below us near a swampy area on the lake.  We stop to see what was going on.  As we sat there on or bikes we could see the bushes and tall reeds swaying back and forth.  There was a lot of deep grunting sound coming from this area and the dogs were getting more and more intense.  That is when we saw it come out from the reeds  it was massive  hairy from head to toe standing upright like a man  but not a man.  This thing was a good 9 feet tall with hair all matted to its body. Its arms were huge and long with massive hands.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  It turned toward an open field and started running from the blue tick hounds that were now chasing after it.  As it ran it appeared to be taking what looked like 8 to 9 foot steps from left leg to right leg  it ran upright just like a man swinging its massive arms back and forth  and the dogs didnâ€™t stand a chance at catching it.  I turned to my friend to say â€œdid you see thatâ€ in disbelief but he was already high telling it down the trail headed for home.  So I started after him when the fishing rods that were tied to my bike got caught up in the tree branches.  This is when I made my mistake of hollering for my friend to come back and help me.  As soon as I hollered I noticed that the thing running across the field had heard me too.  It turned and looked straight at me as it ran the rest of the way across the open field and did not look away until it entered the tree line at the other end.  My friend came back and almost broke our rods grabbing them and jerking them free from the trees.  When we got to my house about a half mile away my mom looked at us and asked â€œWhatâ€™s wrong boyâ€™s you look as though you have seen a ghostâ€.  Well we told her what we had seen and she just shrugged it off saying â€œyou probably saw a bearâ€.  But we explained to her that it was no bear as it ran upright just like a man only taking huge strides  and that the dogs had no chance of catching it.  That was the last time I went fishing on either of those water ways. Incident number 3.  This happened the day after my neighbor and I had seen the thing at the lake.  My parents had gone to an office party for the evening leaving me at home with my older sister.  Well she and her boyfriend at the time decided to leave me at home and go see a movie.  So there I was home alone thinking about the events of the last week and a half  it was about 6 30 in the evening and I was freaking myself out.  I didnâ€™t want to sit there in the house all alone so I got on my bike and started riding up on the street behind my house.  Back then there was a lot of tall grass and bushes between our house and the road behind our house; it runs along under a high power line path  with just a small trail going from our back yard to the road behind our house.  As I road my bike along the road I noticed that when I would get to this one spot there appeared to be something in the tall grass making a loud deep grunting sound.  I looked down that way and could see the grass swaying back and forth but could not see anything else  as I would pass the grunting would stop.  Then when I would turn around and come back by the grunting and swaying would start back upâ€¦. This happened for a couple of passes before I got scared and went and locked myself in the house waiting on my sister to return.  Three days later my friend that had seen the thing down at the lake with me and I were throwing a Frisbee back and forth up on the road near the place I heard the noise.  One of us messed up our throw and the Frisbee went flying down into the grass where the noise had come from.  I told my friend that I was not going to go get it as I thought whatever we had seen down at the lake was down in there the other night.  We both agreed to go down in there together and when we got to the place where I had heard the noises there was this big hole dug out in the ground.  The hole was about 10 foot in diameter and about a foot deep  it looked as though it had been dug out by hand there was also strands of long dark hair all around in the hole.  We got our Frisbee and got out of there quick.  We told our parents about what we had found but they would not go and see for themselves.  That was my last encounter with whatever this thing was. ,1st incident happened behind the 1st house on the left on LeDan Road coming off of Hwy 60 2nd incident happened about a half mile down Ledan Road at Knickerbocker lake 3rd incident happened behind 2nd house on right on Ledan road. ,Hall,2,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13139,yes
1222,In Sept.2006 my 18 year old son and a friend were camping out off of hwy 255 in Habersham Co. (next to the National Forrest and right beside WhiteCo.) They were frightened and run off by howls and growls they swore were not human. High pitched Ape like sounds then VERY LOW long growls. The horses were huddled in a  defensive  stance then at the high pitched sound would run as if they were stampeeding. The boys said they could hear something walking near them but when ever they looked out nothing was there. The next week I went to feed alone and NONE of the 7 dogs that live there would go to the pasture with me. THIS WAS TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTOR! I could hear something following along beside me but each time I stopped to look it was as if a flash of dark just ran by. I wasn  t scared  but I KNOW something was there. January 2007 8 of us went to the barn late at night we heard the sounds the boys had heard and all people and dogs were accounted for inside the barn. While we were in there one old horse that stays in at night was in his stall and he would NOT calm down for anything  not even food! He circled in his stall yelling for 45mins. While he was doing that 2 of us were in a stall with an other horse and something hit the outside of the barn right at that stall. This happened 4 or 5 times until some of us went to look. NOTHING WAS THERE! It was very dark and my son started throwing horseshoe in the direction of the noise. He threw 5 one at a time. We heard 3 hit the ground or trees or bushes  2 NEVER HIT ANYTHING  BUT WE HEARD GRUNTS RIGHT AFTER HE THEW THEM! Febuary 15 2007 my friend Cathy and I have been on several websites looking for clues as to what we are dealing with. We have found 3 foot prints  these are NOT  giant size   but they are much larger than human. There are 2 different Areas that look as if something large has been bedding down there. There are trees that look like the markings of territory shown on some of the web sites. One of the most increddible things we have found is an area by a little stream where an oak tree was down  still fresh  and some of the bark had been shreded and appeared to have been chewed. The gorund around it was totally dry  but the  chewed  bark was slimmy wet  like spit. I brought some home and put it in a baggie and today it is STILL moist! It looks as if spit bubbles are in it. After picking this up and heading back out of the woods we knew something was following us. We heard the high pitched howls  sticks beating together and trees and bushes moving. Still we could not see anything. HOwever I told her to take 3 stepps together and stop with out talking  we did BUT WHAT EVER WAS FOLLOWING US DID NOT!! Then we REALLY got some vocals. We don  t wish this any harm  but we do want to know what is there. We are planning to stay out in the woods near this site This up coming weekend. We would love to have a pro with us! ,This is only 10 to 15 miles away from another site in Helen. Both which back up to the National Forrest. ,Habersham,2,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13137,no
1223,The incident took place in Gwinnet County  a couple of miles away from Norcross - the area used to be much more residential and undeveloped than it is now. The Chattahoochee River was about seven miles away - I assume that this creature had made its way from that direction. I had consequently learned that the area has had several incidents of sightings over the years previous to mine. The events that led up to my sighting occurred over a four month period in the spring of   74. Since then  I have always wished that I could get up close to the creature. The incident started one day in a swampy area. My friends and I were building a  fort  with bamboo stalks  when we noticed that the animal sounds in the woods had disappeared - it was deathly quiet. Then we heard a large branch snap. We got scared  as the sound had come from only 50-75 feet behind us in the swampy part of the bottoms. We imagined a psychopath with a large knife  and proceeded to quietly leave the area in single file. That is when we heard the animal scream and run toward us by the sound of the stomps in the leaves! Afterwards  we discussed what could possibly have made such noises!? A monster? What? We did not know  but somewhere in the conversation  the possibility of a bigfoot came up  and that seemed more plausible to our fourteen year old minds. In the subsequent weeks  we found tracks  five-toed and three-toed  but never a trail of them. We would hear far-off animal sounds  and such....we even found an area of pushed down grasses a few days later  in the spot we figured the screams had come from. We had mounted an   expedition   to look for the creature a few days after the initial incident  and had left our shoe prints in the mud and sand...a couple of days after that  a few of us went back  and  we discovered something very peculiar. In addition to three-toed tracks  we found a series of tracks that looked like the bare feet of children! following our trail of footprints - I am convinced to this day that the creature that had screamed at us was probably a female - with babies! This was the only time we found a trail of tracks. Another time we had found  further back in the woods  a large footprint shape with no discernable features such as toes  etc. on the side of a small creek. On the other side we found another in the mud  which appeared to be the opposite foot. These two footprints were several feet away from each other! A BIG step! I have a picture of the second print. Anyhow  my fiend Mike and I would walk up to the bus stop in the early morning hours  as the dawn began to eventually brighten the sky. He came to my house one morning  with an excitement in his voice  as he told me that he had seen the shadow of the creature across his back yard as he got dressed. He lived just two doors over  and there was a section of woods that ran up behind the houses. He told me that he heard our neighbor  s dog barking wildly  and could hear the creature running through the woods behind the houses. I wasn  t sure if he could be believed  but I was too excited by the prospect to be skeptical. As we walked up to the bus stop  we proceeded to look back down the street our calusac turned off of  as it dead-ended at a petroleum pipeline field  with the swamp on the other side. There was also some woods on the left side of the street  with a stip of cleared ground between the edge of the woods and the street. There was one street lamp on a telephone pole down there near the end of the road on the left side  and it was under this lamp that we noticed a large  cone-shaped dark area. We knew that there had been no mound of dirt or sticks there before - just level ground. As we watched  the   mound   decided to stand up and walk toward the end of the street. However  it turned left  picked something off the ground and ducked into the strip of woods there. As we were about three hundred feet from the creature  it appeared dark grey like a shadow. I grabbed Mike  s sleeve and said  We gotta get closer! - of course  he didn  t want to. The creature was estimated to be seven foot tall  and quite skinny. It had wide hips  and its arms were almost to its knees. It also had what appeared to be a sagittal crest at the top of its head. I don  t know what color it was  but I would guess  from what I subsequently learned about previous sightings in the area  and from Grover Krantz   book  that it must have been white. It would make sense  would it not  that Krantz     Rouge Males   group might very well include any Albinos  or others with   different traits   form the majority of sasquatch apes  that may very well be shunned into a life of wandering the rest of the North American continent. On one morning  I believe it may have been that fall  we were walking (Mike and I) up to the bus stop  and heard a far off two-tone call from the swamp. I   Answered back    and in a few seconds we heard it again  but this time it seemed to be closer-not so far off. I called again  and immediately we heard a return call  again much closer  as if the creature were moving through the swamp toward us. I called again  and this time it sounded as if it were at the edge of the swamp. Then my step-father yelled at us out their bedroom window  which was in front of house  second floor-they often had their windows open in fair weather.  Alright  alright   I yelled  and a few moments later we heard the call again  this time coming from far  far away as the first call had been. It was a two-toned call - a high pitched note  that turned into a low pitched note. It was definitely a call of some sort. ,7 miles from Chattahoochee River  a couple miles from Norcross. ,Gwinnett,2,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13135,yes
1224,my wife sister in law brother in law and myself were sitting in the breakfast nook overlooking the back yard.we were all talking and had just finished dinner. all of the sudden very very loud deep shrieks started coming from just about beyond the tree line. we all jumped up and as the ladies looked out the window my brother in law and i ran down to the patio out back.on the way i grabbed my rifle that i kept near the back door.anyway he and i stepped outside and these bloodcurdling shrieks kept happening.he grabbed a flashlight and when he pointed it at the treeline the shrieks stopped and we heard something tear through the woods grunting very deeply as it went.the next day i went into the woods to look for tracks.i found none but there was a huge trail torn through them.i followed it for a very long way by myself.after about 2 hours of following this trail even though armed i got creeped out and headed back to the house.the tree damage was astonishing.i have been around bears and mountain lions before.whatever that thing was that night was not one of those and i  m not nuts! i never went back into those woods again without my rifle and have never in my life heard anything so scary or seen such damage done to trees by an animal in the deep south ever.i will never forget that night and i will never go hiking or camping unarmed.......or armed for that matter. ,there is a stream that runs deep into the woods i dont know how far back it goes ,Gwinnett,2,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13135,no
1225,NOTICE  We are unsure of what we  ve seen! I live on a golf course in NE GA. I have lived in the area my entire life (23 years). Every sunday and wednesday  me and my buddy Brandon play 18 holes. It was sprinkling rain so we were trying to finsih up the round quickly. As we pulled up to the green on #17 we witnessed what appeared to be about a 6ft animal jump out of a tree  easily 25ft in the air. It hit the ground with a tremendous thud and faster than I could imagine running it jetted deep into the tree line. We initially thought it was a moutntain lion because of the color. It was light brown  almost a sandy color. However  I believe it was simply too large to be a cat of any type. We then immediately thought perhaps a black bear was molting and was in its  cinnamon  color phase  but i dont think its possible for a bear to move this quickly. Whatever it was  the hair on my neck still stands when I think about the tree shaking after it leapt to the ground. Pretty awesome experience! , ,Habersham,2,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13137,yes
1226,It was around 11pm december 31st 2006. I had just got back from a 9 hour drive from florida and I was sitting on the couch with my uncle watching the end of the bears packers game. My sons mother called and I was talking to her when i heard a sound at the window. The only way to discribe it is a hooting sound something like a monkey. Since the lights were on in the house I couldnt see outside so I looked over to my uncle to see if he was messing with me. He was looking out the window and thought I made the noise. Then he jumped up and said  Did you see that ? I looked over to the window and saw the bush moving outside. He grabed one of his guns we were planning on shooting at midnight and ran outside. Once he got outside he could see more movement at the end of the house and I heard a grunting noise near my sisters window. It sounded like it came from a big animal  sounding something like uhhhh uhhhh. His dog max heard my uncle yelling whos there and ran around to the front where he was. As soon as max got there he stopped barking and whimpered as he backed up to my uncle. The dog wouldnt get near the side of the house. We didn  t hear or see anything for a while so went back inside. When we came back out at midnight we heard some noises but they were far off. Except for that  we didnt hear anything else all night. ,Can give directions later if needed ,Hall,2,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13139,yes
1227,On our way home to Rockmart  GA from Birmingham  AL  we were following the directions the GPS gave for the distance.  This brought us to Hwy 120 and Vincent Mountain Road.  We had just made that turn and gone a mile and a half when my husband and myself saw a large figure standing in the tree line.  There was illumination coming from the right side of the road from an additional light source other than our car headlights.  This enabled us to clearly see this figure that was on the left side of the road with one arm straight down and the other arm slightly moving.  I believe that arm movement is what caught our attention making us both look to our left CLEARLY allowing us both to view this creature.  It was covered in reddish brown fur from head to toe with a face I can only describe as Ape like. It appeared to be over seven feet tall. He/she seemed to be getting ready to cross the road. After about 15 seconds past  he and I both screamed out   did you just see what I saw???  I have never been a big believer in the legend of Bigfoot  but I know what I saw tonight.  And I am floored.  I have never written to any site such as this about anything in my life and I certainly didn  t think I would start at 56 years old.

1228,I think I might have seen a big foot on May 30  2012.  I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.  When I walked around the corner of the house  I froze because I saw what looked like something standing at my neighbor  s fence. They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides  just not at the front of the house  and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence  I think on my side of the fence  but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing  but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though  even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master  s degree  so I don  t rush to conclusions  especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants  no trees  nothing propped up against the fence  no spanish moss  just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows  there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate  given that the fence is about 6 feet tall  that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it  s head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot  because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain  but I don  t think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large  very tall  very hairy person.  Also  when I came back inside  my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in  he wasn  t near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.  He usually is begging to come back inside and doesn  t hesitate when I call him.  After that he was very restless all night. ,It was in a residential neighborhood.  Huntingdon Subdivision.  The exact street was Chukar Ct.  This neighborhood is off of exit 5 for N Jefferson (Old Leesburg Hwy) just past Lovers Ln and the Lee Co. Line.

1229,I was in military stationed Ft. Stewart Ga we were conducting wargames my squad was moving through the woods when we started to hear a very low growl then a hi pitched scream as soon as we came out of the woodline to the south of my squad we saw what we thought was an an opposing force we were about 250 feet from the animal so be again to close in on it we called out twice to it and again we heard the growl it then stood up and we realized that it wasn  t human it was between 7 and 8 foot tall and realizing that we were in danger we began to back away at this point it began throw rocks toward us and then took off there was about 300ft between it and the wood line and it took it about 20 seconds to make the distance the rest of the night we heard strange sounds from the woodline from what thought was multiple creatures ,we were just south of the di-ped ,Liberty,13,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13179,yes
1230,I think I have had 3 encounters  I KNOW I have had 1  all within a 5 mile radius. the last one is the one I will tell about. I had just gotten out of my tree stand ( hunting deer ). the sun was down but still enough light to see. My house was only 1/2 mile away and the woods were my back yard. Anyway  I was using the bathroom on a tree  not really paying attention to anything. when I noticed their was no noise  nothing  no owls  no coyote  nothing. I was feeling uneasy and cut the job short  I just wanted to get out of there. I walked around a deadfall and about 40 to 50 feet from me it stood right in my path  on the trail (footpath). at 1st I dont think he knew I was there. He stood with his head up sniffing the air. then He looked right at me. never moving for what seemed like hours. I had a 12 guage in my hand and remember thinking about using it. but something didnt feel right about that. I really didnt feel threatned. I know at some point I started to walk backwards  He took a couple of steps toward me  and cut into the woods on the otherside of the deadfall ( not the side I came around). I stood there listening to it go threw the woods not crashing but just like he was walking like it was no big deal. I asked the owner of the property the next day if he had ever seen or heard of anything back there  he said no so I never mentioned it to ANYONE. I found your site a few weeks ago and have been wondering if I should tell this or not. anyway. I know what I saw and noone can tell me diff. ,edited ,Long,3,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13183,yes
1231,I am reporting this on-going activity to BFRO on behalf of my sister who lives in rural  south Georgia  in Long County . She and my brother in law just bought a double-wide w/ 3+ acres of wooded and swamp surroundings. I visited her the first weekend she started moving in  and I personally heard and felt a large and Very Heavy Running sound on her front Porch the night I visited. She just told me on the phone  that they are hearing on a regular basis  Screaming and Howling and a Definite Fowl Skunky/Rotten Smell. My nephew has said he has seen Something BIG squatting down in the evening across the property near the Storage Barn. Our Elderly Father lives with her  and Dad heard the screaming/howls this weekend and went out the Back Side Porch  just in time to See What he calls an Adult Sasquatch running across the Fenced pasture. She sent me a Photo last week of a HUGE Prominate Deep Print from her front yard w/a small Print right next to it. I saved This Photo on my phone  I will share it with ya  ll. Her new home was empty for over 1.5 years  and I believe there might be a family of squatches living in the swamp and deep woods surrounding her home.

1232,We were cooking a hog mid day on a smoker and across the road in a big field about 300 yards away  there was a huge hairy creature standing beside a white oak and looking at us. I grabbed my phone and took a picture and then it disappeared. After it was gone. Myself and my father in law walked up to examine the area. There were tracks and judging by a mark on the tree and looking at the photograph. This creature was estimated 8 feet tall. The owner of the property says he sees it all the time. ,To be kept confidential ,Macon,11,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13193,yes
1233,Three years ago I was up in the Cohutta Wilderness in N Georgia doing some hiking and fishing by myself. I set up camp at the remnants of an old logging camp  basically just a clearing. It was right next to a small river called the Conasauga river. As soon as I started setting up camp I started hearing what sounded like a big thick stick repeatedly getting wrapped against a tree. I don  t remember how many times it was but I remember it going on for a minute or two. I low crawled down to the river and peeked out from under some trees and looked upriver where the sound was coming from but did not see anything. The sound stopped and I went back and finished setting up camp. After I set up I waded across the stream and went to where I thought the sound came from and found nothing but a bunch of beaver chewed trees. When I saw those chewed trees I attributed the noise to them. After that my entire trip there was quiet. I was by myself and was about 8 miles from anything resembling civilzation. ,I have to dig out my old GA topo maps! They still have the lat long on them for the campsite.

1234,IT WAS A COLD TUESDAY MORNING WHEN I WAS GOING OUT TO GET MY TWO DOGS TO PUT THEM IN THE KENNEL BEFORE I WENT OUT. I WAS STANDING ON THE FIRST STEP UP TO THE DOOR OUT BACK. I COULD SEE RIGHT OVER MY MUCH LARGER KENNEL. THIS LARGER KENNEL WAS AT LEAST 6 FEET TALL. ONE OF MY DOGS HAD JUST CAME IN. I WAS LOOKING FOR THE OTHER DOG.I WAS YELLING HIS NAME. RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LARGER KENNEL WAS A BUILDING A LITTLE BIT SHORTER THAN THE KENNEL. I COULD ONLY SEE THE TOP OF THE KENNEL. I KEPT YELLING THE DOG  S NAME. I LOOKED OVER THE KENNEL TO SEE IF I COULD SEE THE DOG COMING. THAT  S WHEN I SAW A LARGE BROWN HAIRY CREATURE.I COULD SEE ABOUT HALF OF IT  S HEAD  DUE TO THE CAGE PART OF THE KENNEL.IT HAD VERY LONG REDDISH BROWN HAIR GOING FROM IT  S FORHEAD DOWN AS FAR AS I COULD SEE. IT HAD SHORT LIGHTER BROWN HAIR ON WHAT I COULD SEE OF IT  S FACE. IT HAD AN ARM THAT WAS ABOUT 3 FEET LONG. IT HAD SHORT LIGHTER BROWN HAIR ON IT  S HANDS JUST LIKE IT  S FACE.IT HAD LONGER REDDISH BROWN HAIR FROM IT  S WRIST ALL THE WAY DOWN IT  S ARM. IT HAD A POINTY EAR. I KNOW MOST SUPPOSEDLY SEEN BIGFOOT SIGHTINGS DON  T HAVE POINTY EARS  BUT IT  S WHAT I SAW. IT HAD TO BE 7 FEET TALL BECAUSE IT WAS TALLER THAN THE KENNEL. I HEARD IT LAND AS IF IT HAD JUMPED UP IN THE AIR AND THEN LANDED ON SOMETHING.I HEARD 4 THUMPS  AS IF IT LANDED ON IT  S KNEES FIRST AND THEN IT  S HANDS. I SHUT THE DOOR AND RAN BACK IN. THEN ABOUT 2 OR 3 DAYS LATER I WAS WALKING OUT TO MY CAR AND I HEARD SOMETHING MAKE A NOISE. IT SOUNDED LIKE A GRUNT OR GROWL.IT WAS IN THE SAME AREA THAT I HAD SEEN IT LAST TIME.WHERE I LIVE  THERE AREN  T ANY BROWN BEARS. NOTHING ELSE COULD HAVE BEEN 7 FEET TALL OR THE SAME COLOR IT WAS.THIS HAS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING LIVING IN THE WOODS BEHIND MY HOUSE. ,IT WAS REMOTLY CLOSE TO THE WOODS. ,Murray,4,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13213,yes
1235,We live about a mile from Austin Bridge Road in Paulding County  Georgia.  We believe we may have seen whatever it is was seen in your Report # 14887.   We were going to drive out to Hiram for dinner in our Suburban;  and were heading towards Ridge Road on Austin Bridge.  Near where Austin Bridge intersects Mein Mitchell Road; we saw what I would describe as an animal with the basic body structure of a bear but standing on it  s hind legs;  and a face that seemed more wolfish than anything else.   It had to be about 9 feet tall.  It stood in the road.  At about 200 yards we decided to pull the vehicle around and go a different direction rather than drive any closer. , ,Paulding,9,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13223,yes

I EXITED MY VEHICLE AND TOOK ABOUT FIVE STEP TOWARDS MY HOUSE AND HEARD A HOWL / APE GRUNT SOUND THAT STOPPED ME IN MY TRACKS . THE HOWL ONLY LASTED ABOUT 5 SECONDS BUT IT WAS LOUD  AND IN A SCARY WAY .  I THEN LOOKED TOWARDS THE WOODLINE AND COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING I LOOKED AT MY NEIGHBORS HOMES AND ALL THE LIGHTS WERE OFF   I THEN SAID TO MY SELF    SOMEBODY IS MESSING WITH ME   I WAITED ABOUT TEN SECONDS AND I TRIED TO YELL BACK LIKE THE HOWL I HEARD AND IMMEDIATELY HEARD SOMETHING IN THE WOODS HOWL BACK BUT IT WAS CLOSER   I WAS THEN VERY SCARED  AND I PULLED OUT A GUN I WAS CARRYING AND WALKED BACKWARDS TO MY HOUSE . THIS THING IN THE WOODS HOWLED AND STOPPED THEN A SECOND ONE HOWLED AND STOPPED NOT MOORE THEN 75 FEET AWAY. THE HOWLING LASTED ABOUT 15 SECONDS ( THE WHOLE TIME I WAS WALKING BACKWARDS TOWARDS MY HOUSE )THE WHOLE TIME I WAS WALKING AWAY I NEW WHAT EVER WAS MAKING THAT SOUND WAS VERY BIG AND I WAS VERY SCARED  (I DONT SCARE EASY   IM A 6 FOOT 300LB MAN )  I WENT INSIDE MY HOME AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW FOR A WHILE AND NEVER HEARD OR SEEN ANYTHING AFTER I GOT INSIDE . I WOKE UP MY WIFE THE NIGHT THIS HAPPENED AND ASKED HER IF ANY APES HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE ZOO OR CIRCUS THAT I MIGHT OF MISSED ON THE NEWS AND SHE SAID NO .I DIDNT THINK  AT THE TIME THE HOWL I HEARD WAS A BIGFOOT UNTIL I HEARD SOME SOUND CLIPPINGS AND READ MY NEIGHBORS REPORT NUMBER 14887.

1238,As we were coming home from church about 9 30 pm  on  a Wednesday night we were headed down HWY 101.  We were driving slower than usual because it was so dark and there wasn  t alot of traffic on the road  making sure we didn  t hit any deer.  As we were approaching a curve we spotted movement on the right side of the road.  We slowed more because we thaught it was a deer.  As we got closer it decided to cross the road.  It was so big it seemed to be a bear.  But as we looked closer it was only on 2 legs instead of 4.  It was so tall it seemed to walk hunched over dragging its arms.  Were we seeing things???  We got chills as we passed an old swamp clearing in Paulding Co.  and realized that we had heard tales of Big Foot in this area and after researching what we saw  we know 100% that we saw him.  It was the biggest  widest creature I have ever seen and really didn  t seem to be bothered by us and then he just disapeared  like in the blink of an eye. ,Headed down 101 from Paulding county to Carroll County ,Paulding,9,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13223,yes
1239,It was roughly around the end of August 2011 and I was at my mothers house. The house is located in the Burnt Hickory area of Paulding County  GA. She lives in a subdivision but it is still out in the country. I have always been and still a night owl. I stepped out on her back deck around 0200 in the morning to have a cigarette. Behind her house is nothing but trees  shrubs  hills  and creeks. There is an abundance of wildlife in the area that range from deer to coyotes. I was a Reconnaissance Marine for 8 years with multiple deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan. I have been to numerous survival schools all over America from Maine to California. Most of my life was spent in the woods and I understand what animals make what sounds. I do not unnerve very easily. So back to my story. I was on the back deck smoking a cigarette when I heard this loud howl/scream. The first howl grabbed my attention instantly. Because I had only heard it one time I was unsure what it was. So I listened with a bit more interest the second time and I was trying to run everything through my mind to to figure out what it was. I knew it was not a deer or coyote because the howl was so deep. So then I started to think about my surroundings. There is a highway a couple miles away so I thought it may have been a big rig/semi. Then I heard it again. That option was completely ruled out. So I started to think of what else it could be. Perhaps it was a generator running in the woods. Again I heard the howl. Not a generator! I had run through so many different scenarios that I was starting to get freaked out. The howl was from a living creature and it was much larger than I. Each howl lasted approx. 5 seconds with a 10-15 second rest before the next. I stood out there for about 5 minutes before listening to this before I was to freaked and headed inside. I immediately ran up to my computer and googled howling sounds in Paulding County  GA. There were several websites regarding howling in the area but most of them were referring to Picketts Mill Battlefield. Then I came across BFRO. Initially I was like  yeah...okay! . I started looking through the website and I came across some of the audio submissions from Ohio. Once I heard it I nearly crapped my pants. That howl was to a T of what I heard. The only difference was mine sounded much deeper  closer  and I didn  t have dogs barking in the background. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. I read through some of the other posts from Paulding County and Bartow County. What they all had to say was pretty freaky. Then I looked at the time frames they were made and where. During those time frames there was construction in the area. And when I heard my sounds they had just recently begun construction in the area. Not sure if there is any connection with that. I did bring it up to my wife the next day and she could hear the fear in my voice as I talked about it. Anyone that has been willing to listen I have mentioned it to. , ,Paulding,9,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13223,yes
1240,I was driving on Old Cartersville road towards HWY 61 just past the chicken farm but before the pond.  I had my 13 year old son with me. I saw what I thought was a bear crouched down on the right side of the road. I turned to tell my son to look at the bear. My son was in the back seat. Before I could turn back around all the way. I noticed it stood up on two legs. My son was asking what it was. Then I noticed it was over 7 foot 6 inches tall covered in long black hair. It was burley! It was all of 500-600 pounds. It was no more than 20-30 yards outside our truck window.  It was so large I could see its muscles in its legs (thighs). Its head appeared to sit on its shoulders like it had no neck. The head looked like it came to a point. It looked like a bipedal ape! It had something white in its hand! That  s when it registered it had hands and not claws. The arms were longer than any human arms. They seemed to stretch closer to the knee area. When it walked the knees worked perfectly. It did not have a bow legged affect. Which made it seem human but it looked like an ape. It started to move towards the road walking on two legs. My lights stayed on it. It seemed to want out of my lights. When it walked for the road it was headed in the path of my truck. I was on a small curve. So my lights followed it. I hit my fog lights & it turned back from the direction it came. It picked up speed and started to run still on two legs. I could see the foot falls & the thigh muscles bounce. Also saw butt muscles flex all under the hair. It started moving so fast the white thing in its hand was almost a blur. The next day  I returned to the area. Where it ran off into the woods was uphill. I thought it was flat as fast as it was moving. The house close by had chicken coops with white and brown chickens in it. , ,Paulding,9,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13223,yes
1241,Last night  late around 1 45a.m. I wasn  t sleeping well.. felt a little indigestion.. came downstairs to get some antacids.. Sat down in the living room to watch a few minutes of TV to wait for the medicine to work. Around 2 am.. a very loud scream/roar sounded out that startled me right up off the sofa. The roar lasted about 3 or 4 seconds. The sound had a deep chested sound.. like something large. I listened and heard no other noises.. no other animals.. no thumping.. no running.. nothing but silence. Sound did not sound like a person. Did not sound like a dog growling..did not sound like a coyote.. did not sound feline... I approached the front window and looked out through the blinds. Whatever it was sounded close. I would guess it was less than 30 feet from the front porch. The porch light was on. As was the streetlight. I live in a populated city neighborhood with multiple houses around me. Nobody else has come forward to say they heard the same. Location in Dallas but bordering Acworth.. Paulding/Cobb county. ,Located in the Timberlands subdivision..

1242,My son was in the kitchen eating looking out the window in back of our home when he said he saw a long arm then a big figure but it wasn  t a person.

1243,THE DATE WAS 1963  I WAS 17 YEARS OLD AND HAD JUST GOT MY DRIVERS LICENSE. I WAS ON VACATION ON JEKYLL ISLAND GEORGIA. AT THAT TIME IS WAS NOT VERY BUILT UP AT ALL. IT WAS 4TH OF JULY EVENING JUST AFTER DUSK. I WAS WITH MY 10 YEAR OLD BROTHER  AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING TO THE NORTH END OF THE ISLAND TO OBSERVE THE FIRE WORKS DISPLAY. HOW EVER I REALLY JUST WANTED TO DO ALLOT OF DRIVING AROUND. I HAD TURNED OFF THE MAIN ROAD  ONE WHICH CIRCLED THE PERIMETER OF THE ISLAND  ON TO A DIRT ROAD. IT WAS RATHER NARROW AND WINDING. AS I CAME AROUND A TURN I SAW A CREATURE STEP OUT OF THE WOODS ON TO THE ROAD. IT STOPPED  AS THE LIGHTS FROM MY CAR SHOWN ON IT. IT WAS ABOUT 5 1/2 FEET TALL. IT WAS COVERED WITH LONG HAIR FROM HEAD TO TOE. THE HAIR COLOR ALMOST SEEMED GRAYISH. IT STOPPED FOR A MOMENT THEN JUST PROCEEDED TO CROSS THE ROAD AND GO INTO THE WOODS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. NO ONE REALLY BELIEVED THE STORY  BUT MY BROTHER DOES RECALL BEING FRIGHTENED THAT EVENING  BUT NOTHING MORE. I NEVER THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UNTIL A SAW A SHOW ON BIG FOOT THAT MENTIONED SIGHTINGS IN THAT AREA. , ,Glynn,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13127,yes
1244,My girlfriend and I were on vacation in Blue Ridge  GA. We went hiking the day before and the ground was frozen solid from the weather. The following day we went hiking and it rained the night before. It was very cloudy all day and still pretty cold but the ground was thawing out. We decided to hike the Benton-MacKaye Trail off Highway 515. We started at 8 45 a.m. and followed the trail around to an open field and decided to take a quick break. While on  the break  I yelled as loud as I could twice and the echo was impressive. We continued following the trail for another 1 1/2 hours until we decided to head back. On the way back around the field  we noticed a huge footprint. It was obvious it was a footprint because you could see the toes in the clay. The clay wasn  t hard nor was it wet and slick. We passed it on the way and had no walking troubles or saw the print. There were footprints around other than ours  however  we didn  t see anybody from the start of the trailhead and throughout the hike.  We looked around for more and discovered 4-5 more tracks the same size  others that looked similar but less defined. It was a very deep print  looked to have 4 toes. It seemed to be walking down the hill towards the creek. ,The section of the BMT that crosses Highway 515 in Gilmer County  GA.

1245,My father died when I was three years of age. I was the oldest of four children. Our mother decided after the funeral that it would be best to move back home with her parents. This was in 1959. Years later in the early 60  s  in the fall of the year all four of us were playing in the backyard. We had our first encounter with what we believed to have been a gorilla. It was underneath and inside the house  s unfinished basement. I remember tossing rocks at it  but the very large animal only smiled. Being frighten half to death as kids we ran for our Mom. After returning to the scene there was no trace of a very large gorilla. Also later on through the years family members would come across very large foot prints and sometimes big red eyes looking in windows at night. ,Near the intersection of Campbellton Rd. and County Line Rd. ,Fulton,17,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13121,yes
1246,About two years ago I was riding my bicycle with a friend of mine out in a rural area. Just out side of Calhoun  and just barely over the county line in to Walker County. I heard what sounded like heavy wood knocks. Big loud ones. At the time I just thought maybe someone was building something off in the woods. But now Iâ€™m more inclined to believe that it could have been a Sasquatch. Because there was nothing but woods  and fields in the section of the road where I heard the noises come from. I havenâ€™t rode out there in a long while either so nothing further to report. My friend that I was riding with would have no recall of the incident. Like I said just sounded like building going on. ,Take 156 out of Calhoun going west take a right on Everett Springs Rd.

1247,I was driving home from  work at about 11 00pm. As I rounded a curve in the road I saw something walking across the road in front of me. It was tall  not slim but not thick and covered in grayish - brownish hair. It never turned to look at me and just loped across the road and off in the dark. I was traveling about 40 mph and slowed quite a bit to ensure it would make it across without me hitting it. ,Lee  s Mill Road ,Fayette,14,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13113,yes
1248,An unseen animal howling LOUDLY while violently shaking a 12X45 mobile home almost off its blocks. My wife and I were awake  she was cleaning in the kitchen  and I was in the living room reading. Suddenly a LOUD howling sound began and at the same moment the trailer began shaking very violently. The howling and the shaking lasted ten seconds  but it was very loud as that of a bull horn. My first response was thinking we were having an earthquake.My second was someone outside somehow making the noise while somehow shaking the trailer. I grabbed my pistol and ran outside. There was nothing moving outside any where. ,Our river place is on the Ohoopee River next to the Griffin Ferry Bridge.

1249,We have had several encounters with this creature. We used to have it living in the back of our woods near the swamp  but since clearing of land further back from other neighbors  it has moved to the other side of the forest. It still frequents the area. Run-ins still occur and have now for years. And now  there is a young with the mother. I really do not know what to say but the most important thing to me is trying to protect this animal  aka Bigfoot. This creature has not harmed anyone  is shy  but is really not afraid of people. I am hoping that someone here will help me out in determining the next step I could take. I DO NOT WANT THIS ANIMAL TO BE HARMED IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE OR REMOVED FROM ITS HABITAT. IT IS NOT A THREAT TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING!! There have been too many occasions to name that just proved to me and others that we have a family living close by. Seen  heard  smelled  footprints  etc. I would like to somehow get help from the govenment to protect this creature so no harm could come to it from anyone and that no one would try to hunt it down just for the money and fame. That is the only reason I am not giving the location of where all this is occurring. I am a registered nurse. I care about my job and reputation but I would rather have a  rep of being crazy  than ever having any harm done to this creature. Please respond with some help to point me in the right direction to help secure this animal  s well-being and safety. Please. Thank you for your time and I await anxiously for your response. , ,Elbert,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13105,yes
1250,While riding 4wheelers my wife and I and another couple decided to follow the railroad tracks to the next town. It was about a ten mile treck that goes through swamp and none of which is developed. I have never followed it before at night. At about halfway to the other town (Meldrim Ga.) it looked as though the light at the far end of the tracks was getting brighter.We pulled off the side and backed up to the ditch that parallels the railroad bed to wait to see if the light got brighter.While waiting my wife and friends sat and talked and I climbed back onto the tracks on foot to watch the light. The plan was to wait ten minutes and if it didn  t get brighter it was possibly a light from another source. After about five minutes my wife and her friend heard something moving progressively closer in the woods. Then large objects began falling around us. I looked at everyone asked had they heard it   then there was no doubt. Larger objects started coming down -large rocks  large limbs. Many were landing in the water  not all in the same place   not all the same size  making huge splashes like bricks would make or larger. One then two then multiple large things landing on both sides and on top of the tracks. Everyone with me by then was right beside me and none of them were playing a joke. Something was throwing stuff at us from the woods. I kept shining my flashlight but never saw what. These were big objects and there is no way any animal I am familliar with could have done this. I have hunted all my life and stay in the woods all the time but this truly freaked me out. As a side note when I used to stay with a friend at his house near the tracks on the Bloomingdale end his grandad used to tell us of howls that came from the woods down the swamp that he couldnt explain. He said they would sound like screaming I  ve always been skeptical of that but now I am not so sure. ,On the only railroad track from Bloomingdale -Meldrim   This occurred between the two ,Effingham,1,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13103,no
1251,I was 18 years old at the time  and riding cross-country endurance for a local ranch. I had been riding for the ranch for 4 years when this event occured. I had been out training a Black Arabian Stud that day  riding about 20 miles in the woods. It was getting dark  but the moon was full. I was riding on a wide dirt road with woods on eitherside. Just after crossing a wood bridge I was going around an  S  curve in the road when the horse started acting up. I then heard a rustling sound in the woods next to me. Next came a loud scream from the same area  I looked and saw a pair of eyes. They were greenish in color. What happened next went by very quickly. What ever it was jumped out from the woods next to me and grabbed the saddle and back of the horse. As this happened  I jumped off the saddle onto the horses neck  let go of the reins and puit my arms around the horses neck. The horse bolted and ran  I didn  t slow down or look back. This thing was face to face with me. I remember the face and hands most of all. It had a HAND- not a paw.the hands were huge will hair on them and long nails. The saddle (an endurance saddle  very light weight without a horn) leather was torn and had deep scratches or gouges in it where the creature had grabbed and pulled at it. It had very human-like features but thicker and scary looking. The hair around his face and neck was very hairy and wirey looking (blackish-brown) with piercing eyes and it had teeth but missing some and all yellow. This thing was massive  standing upright but alittle crouched. I was on a horse that is 16 1/2 hands and was looking it almost straight in the face. This was not a cougar or bear. ,120 West to Douglasville  GA. Exit at Chapel Hill. Off of TimberRidge Rd. ,Douglas,27,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13097,yes
1252,Sometime in the summer of 1977  (it was a long time ago and I do not remember the month or date)  We were camped in the woods by a creek outside of Albany Ga. at a place we called  Skeeter Beach . I want to submit this report because reading BFRO report #18707 reminded me of the incedent  and may have been in the same area   Kinchafoochee Creek . I do not remember the highway number  but it was maybe ten miles out of the town of Albany Ga. Several of us young Marines were stationed at the Base at Albany attending an electronics school at the time. On the weekends  we would sometimes go out to this remote spot in the pine forest/swamp area outside of town. The highway crossed a clear water creek and there was a popular party area off the highway by this bridge where you could park the vehicles and then walk farther back to this area we called Skeeter Beach. We had made a dam and hand dredged the sand and gravel in one particularly nice area of the creek and had made ourselves a very nice little swimming hole. On the night of the incedent  myself and two other Marines had elected to stay the night  as it was already late and we had a nice camp fire going. we finally laid down on blankets and sleeping bags to go to sleep. In the middle of the night one of the other guys woke me up because he heard something big in the woods. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and sat up to listen. The third guy also woke up from hearing us talk and we all could hear something very large circling our little camp on the other side of the creek. A feeling of dread overcame us about the size of this thing we heard and we started piling wood on what was left of our fire. As the fire got bigger and bigger and started putting out more light  the animal began backing off from the camp so as to stay just out of the fire light. Whatever it was  it was big! We could hear it walking in a steady crunch-crunch that sounded to me like it was walking on two feet. I am a deer hunter (bow and arrow)  and I know how to vary my steps in the woods so I don  t sound like a human. This thing had a steady gait that sounded like a man walking  but much larger. We could hear the muffled breaks of large sticks burried under the forest mat. This was no deer and I don  t think it was a bear unless it was walking on two legs. As we got the fire roaring with flames licking about ten feet in the air  the thing finally moved out over the next ridge across the creek so as not to be seen. It was uncanny how the thing was intelegent enough to stay just outside the firelight. It was also uncanny how this thing turned three young Marines into a bunch of fraidy cats about to pee our pants! We never noticed any smell  but the slight breeze was at our backs making the animal downwind from us. We kept the fire pretty big the rest of the night and did not even try to sleep again. At first light  we took the biggest brands out of the fire to use as tourches  put out the fire and walked back along the trails to where our vehicles were parked. When we went back after that night  we always left before dusk and never again attempted to stay the night  ,Unknown  but I think it was to the North-East of town. ,Dougherty,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13095,yes
1253,My father-in-law hit and killed a creature 30 years ago in his car. He called DR they took it away.  He has never heard anything back from it.  6-7 ft tall covered in hair walking on 2 legs like a man.  This is the interesting thing... snout like a bear or hog long fangs!! 30 people gathered around to see it.  I don  t think it was a bigfoot but it was something weird like a werewolf.   I have seen big foots on our property   wood knocks so loud it scared me to death. Terrible smells like I can  t explain and foot prints in fields.  Small monkey like creatures in trees.

1254,While vacationing in south Georgia I decided to visit a remote forested area to listen to night sounds and make wildlife recordings. After sun set there were a lot of owls calling and several alligators growling from the nearby river. At one point I heard three wood knocks come from the forest  and as I continued to listen I heard two distant whoops. The hour grew late and I decided to leave my audio recorder behind  running overnight  to record anything else that might happen.

1257,I was 19 years old at the time. My family and myself dont ever talk about what happened. It happened one evening in the woods in mid November of 2003. My grandfather owns about 4 000 acres in Coweta County. The land consists of a small cabin  some barns  3 lakes  and lots of off road trails winding and criss crossing everywhere throughout the woods. My father  grandfather  uncle  and 1 cousin hunt the land as much as possible during the hunting season. We had our own 4 wheelers and would depart to our separate tree stands or specific areas to hunt each day. We have all hunted this land for a very long time  since i was 10 years old. Never before have any of us seen  heard  or even thought about bigfoots being in these woods ever! My father and I had just purchased a set of 2 way motorola radios to communicate between each other while hunting. well this particular spot i was going to hunt that evening was very deep in the woods in the north east corner of the property. My father and i had scouted this area the day before and we had noticed some strange things. Along the edge of the power line  for about a 20 foot stretch  there were tree limbs  about as round as my wrist  and a good 15-20 foot from the ground  broken and snapped off. There was this rock about thirty feet into the woods from the power line. This huge rock had been recently overturned but the thing was about 4 or 5 feet wide by 3 feet tall. This part of the woods had main power lines running through it which are very favorable to hunt deer on. I had decided that night that if a bear was in this area  I wanted to hunt it. I went there in the morning to set up my stand and scouted the area a little better. We met back at the cabin at 10 00a.m.. My grandfather said that he has never once seen a bear or bear signs of any kind in the 20 plus years hes been hunting in coweta county. He said it sounded ridiculous and that i shouldnt go hunt there by myself  but the thought of being able to bag a bear in these woods was too much! The time came to depart to the evening hunt. My dad told me to keep in touch with the 2 way radios if anything happened and that he would be located about half a mile or more from me. I rode my 4 wheeler down the familiar trails and parked it a couple hundred yards from my newly found hunting destination. As I approached my stand i had put there that morning i noticed a nasty smell in the air  not strong but would catch wiffs of it with the breeze. it smelled like old garbage. I was sitting in the tree stand for a good hour with no action  but the whole time that smell was barely present. My stand was about 40 feet into the woods from the power line near the overturned rock. the power line itself was streched along my left side with the thick woods to my front right and rear. I had a natural path through the woods to the power line  a perfect opening to see anything crossing. i was quietly looking around waiting for a bear to appear when all of a sudden i heard the familiar sound of a deer approaching fast from behind. i looked over my left shoulder to see a doe running through the woods at full pace from the powerline  running fast like something had spooked it. Out of the corner of my eye i saw a flash of movement through the woods along the edge of the power line  just where the doe was running from . i lifted my gun and peered through the scope to try and catch a glimpse of the figure that was making its way along the edge of the powerline. I was hoping it would be my bear and was waiting for it to cross that opening through the woods to the powerline for a clean  clear shot but when the creature/figure stepped into that opening  I saw through the scope that it wasnt a bear but looked human. Just 1 simple stride from this giant thing and it was out of sight of the opening. i was so stunned that i couldnt fire off a shot; besides i thought it was a man. But the thing was very tall  possiblly 8 feet. It had a cinnamon- dark brown hairy looking body. The shoulders were broad and squared and its long arms swung from side to side as it walked at a very fast pace. It happened so fast  i could only get a good look at it for a split second  letting me see enough to know that it wasnt a hunter. After it ran across the opening to the power line i heard a big commotion  starting at the powerline about where that thing should have been and heading into the woods right towards me! I tried to grab the motorola radio to get help from my father but was shaking so bad that i fumbled with it. I quickly lifted my rifle to get ready to blast whatever this big mysterious creature was. 3 more doe came bounding up looking spooked as hell which was the commotion i heard coming my way from the powerline.  The 3 doe ran as fast as they could and outta sight behind my right shoulder. Nothing followed them  nor did i see or hear it again  but that nasty smell still lingered in the air. I called my father on the radio and told him to get over to my spot to get me . I told him I wasnt getting out of the tree stand until he gets there. He came quickly to retrieve me and found me very disturbed. I told him everything that had happened and he didnt know if he believed me or not  but knew i had seen something. ,n/a ,Coweta,2,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13077,yes
1258,Been hearing a lot of knocking in the woods close behind my house. It  s very loud  and has a repeated pattern like as follows  one loud solid hit  3 quick taps  then another loud solid hit. Both my father and I have heard this as we are just walking outside. The scary incidents have happened to me 3 different nights in the weeks prior. Tonight was the most scary as I had at least 3 around my house. I have been knocking back and whistling  to no avail  but sitting out on the back patio I can hear the walking  limbs being broken as it walks. Then everything is quiet  as if they have reached the edge of the wood line and are watching me. A few times I  ve sought to entertain them  I  d do silly stuff or whistle a tune. The night before I was met with three limbs being cracked within 30 mins. This was too frequent to be natural. I have tried to get trail cam video  no luck. But the nights when I  m by myself and I go out as per usual. They  re already there and waiting on me. Tonight I tried something different  I decided to just casually sit facing the woods and talk to them. I  d just say that I was their friend and I meant them no harm. As I talked  the woods lit up with noise. I was being approached from 3 different directions. But the largest one concerned me  I could hear limbs breaking as it got closer. I had a flashlight but was reluctant to shine it until I was freaked out  the thing was too close. I lit it up. What I could see appeared to be a very large animal not quite to the edge  and colors making it almost indistinguishable from the woods. But the eyes  oh man  they shined bright green. I would  ve thought it to be a critter only they were spaced about 5 inches apart and I could make out the outline of something squatting  just starting right at me not even blinking. This thing was huge  it nearly made me run seeing it. I turned the light off and went the hell inside. I checked again an hour later  and still could hear it walking around out there. This is something that has happened to me numerous times  and every time I  m alone I can get a response from them. But if I have someone with me they do not show. There are definitely bigfoots in Adel. And I have some that come to my backyard. There  s been only one incident of the house being smacked during the night. And I  ve noticed that every night as they approach  all the neighborhood dogs go crazy. Now that I  ve seen them and know what to look for  I see and hear their presence all the time. This is definitely a hot bed. I just don  t have the technology to show u definitive proof. ,Between Adel and Boyette Town Road ,Cook,17,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13075,yes
1259,This incident was not my personal experience  but rather my moms  but she is not as good with computers as I am so I  m reporting it for her. She lives with me though  and can be reached at the info i will leave later. The occurance happen several years ago in a rural locaion close to our home. My mom was on her way home from a friends house that lives only a short drive from our home. It was late afternoon and she was coming around a curve in the road  when a tall (6-7) ft tall hairy biped slowly crossed the road in front of her car  almost causing her to wreck. She said it looked like a bear on two legs walking  with the face of a gorilla. The animal walked directly in front of the car without seeming to get in any hurry  even though she had to slam on the breaks to keep from hitting it. She said it only looked back at her once and never stoped walking.It then disappeared into the woods by a lake. ,it was close to a pond  the creature was crossing the road right to left  toward the pond.also along a power line cleared out trail  but densley wooded area along the clearing also. ,Coweta,2,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13077,yes
1260,My wife and I live in rising fawn just off of highway 11 on cave springs rd. We were coming home from visiting family in alabama in February 2020. We were traveling north on highway 11 just after crossing into georgia. It was around 11 PM. We were driving a 2003 toyota sequoia traveling around 55 mph. It came up out of the ditch when I was about 20 or 30 feet away from it. It was on my wife  s side of the vehicle (passenger side). As my front bumper reached the point where it was I saw the size of this thing. It stopped on the white line on the road and realized I was about to hit it. It kept coming up out of the ditch as my front fender came by it. At this point the top of its head was about at the roof height of the car. When it was at the mirror on the door its chest was at the window on my wife  s door. This thing  s chest alone filled the entire window and its arms were straight down. This thing was sucking it in to keep from getting hit. I could not believe it afterwards that my mirror didn  t get knocked off. It  s arms were were like 5 gallon buckets at the bicep. It was a grayish white color with either tints of brown or black. As we got past it I realized with the height of our sequoia and its chest being in the door window it had to be 8 feet tall or more. I am almost 6 feet tall and my head doesn  t come above the sequoia. ,[Investigator (MM) notes  GPS coordinates for where the sasquatch came out to the road  34.722917  -85.545434 ,Dade,7,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13083,yes
1261,My wife and I were fishing in the Ohoopee river in a Jon boat when we heard something come running thru the woods towards us. Tree branches and bushes were being snapped off. It stopped short of the edge of the creek and was behind the bushes standing about 7-8 feet tall. We saw the top of its head which was a reddish brown with hair covering its facial features. It made no noise as it stood there watching us. We quickly paddled to the opposite shore where our campsite was set up. The creature paced back and forth along the bank  but just behind the bushes. We could plainly hear each step and each limb being broken as well as getting glimpses of it thru the brush. It stayed until late pm  early a.m. when we heard a loud splash into the river. We heard it scramble back up the bank and run thru the woods away from us. It sounded like a horse running thru the woods (noise from the breaking of limbs and heavy foot steps pounding the ground). Next am we saw where it had clawed its way back up the bank  leaving impressions from hands and fingers  not hoof marks like a deer or hog would leave. We had no camera to take photos. ,32.401392  -82.316257 ,Emanuel,4,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13107,yes
1262,I am mainly submitting this report to see if any one else has recently submitted a report in this location for the same date. On Thursday April 1st at around 9 00 a.m. myself wife and two sons were on our way to Hilton Head for spring break  We were also following my Parents. As we were coming down the hill on Hwy 16 East (about a mile from the Swainsboro exit) which is a four lane highway two lanes on each side seperated by a large median  most of the area in this part of middle GA is swamp or marsh. Fairly heavy traffic was around us too  which I should explain as about 3 cars right around us with about a hundred yard break and then at least 5 to 6 more. The group of cars is where this happened. The group of cars in front of us were approaching a wooded area in the median (which widens even furter at that point  and on either side of the highway was dense woods) at this point something came out of the woods on the right side of the road and sprinted across the road almost right in front of a semi. What was so strange was that this thing seem to clear 2 lanes in 2 steps. At his point I was trying to rationalize why a man would do this and not wait for a break in traffic. I watched leap in to the woods. At this point I looked at my wife and and without a word she looked back and said did you see that. I immediatley called my parents in front of us and my mom answered the phone and her first words did you see that and what was it. All i can tell you is it moved at lightening speed my wife said she saw it go across the other 2 lanes. But we all had the same conclusion it was large because you could see the comparison of its head as it seemed to run in front of a long nosed Peterbuilt semi. Another oddity is that it ws completely black from head to toe. , ,Emanuel,4,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13107,yes
1263,I was walking home from my boyfriend  s house about an hour after dusk when I heard a very loud  very deep breath. I felt the vibration under my feet when it moved. I had startled it. I looked and saw a huge creature it was 8 or 9 ft. tall and had a huge head 3 times the size of a man  s head and it stared at me as I passed by. I prayed and walked as fast as I could without running all the way home. This happened to me in 2006 in Summertown Georgia on Johnson Powell Drive. This is a true story. The most terrifying story of my life. ,On Johnson Powell Drive just off Hwy 56 in Emanuel County. ,Emanuel,4,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13107,yes

In 1985 I was assigned as a Military Policeman to the US Army Garrison at Fort McPhearson  Ga.(Atlanta). We recieved a alert for my squad to go and secure the crash site of an AH-1 (Cobra) helicopter that belonged to the Texas Army National Guard that crashed in the Chatahoochee Forest  North of the Ranger Camp. We were helicoptered into the ranger camp with our gear and we boarded a  Duece  (2 1/2 ton truck) for the ride to the crash site. We made it to within about 1/4 mile of the site and had to carry our gear in.  We relieved the Rangers that were guarding the site (the crash occured about 12 hrs earlier) and set up camp. Our job was to keep people out of the area (curiosity seekers  news people  etc.) until the crash investigation team arrived and took over. The crash site was small  about 100 feet by 30 feet because the Cobra crashed in one piece and then burned  so the whole area had that fuel smell and that  burned flesh  smell. ,The location was northwest of Dalonega  Ga about 5-6 miles in the Chatahoochee Forest  4 miles north of Camp Darby [Camp Frank D. Merrill] (US Army Ranger training camp). [The crash site is in the Blue Ridge Wildlife Refuge] The main N - S Park access (dirt and gravel) road was about two miles from the location. The Park starts about 1/2 mile north of Camp Darby and the access road is the road from Darby into the Park - follow this road for about 2 miles and take the right (north) fork. About 2-3 miles north of the fork and on the west side of the road is a large mountain (I dont know the name of it  and was probably only known as a number on the military maps  however I do not recall what it is) the incident occured near a ridge  about 1/3 of the way up mountain.

1265,Hello BFRO  I golf three times a week and often up to a one hour drive from my home in Peachtree City GA.  I was very close to my home and near Fayetteville GA.  I was with three (3) other grown men and NO we had yet to open any cold beer.  We drove up to our tee box and a friend yelled at me -  Dave look there  s a bigfoot.   All of us were about forty yards or so from a large black creature walking from left to right up a slight hill.  I watched for just a few seconds and swung the golf cart back up the hill and much closer to the woods & in the direction that the large creature was walking.  Mid December so near 50% of the leaves were OFF the trees / bushes that just several days before would not be able to see through.  Anyway I got closer to the woods and in that general direction of its walking.  Seemingly walking straight at us was a 7 foot or large large black creature.  I asked my buddy sitting beside me if it was walking AT US but he told me to GO to GO to GO as he wanted NO part of what we were watching.  I yelled at it and down it went behind a log or some debris.  It got up after just a few seconds and began to walk AWAY from us.  I kept yelling and it turned as the sun hit it and I saw the left side of its large shoulder and left side of its face.  It appeared to have fur like a beautiful jet black mink coat.  The shoulders and arms were HUGE.  We watched for just a few seconds as it disappeared over the hill going back the way it came into that wooded area.  Deer Hunting season had just begun in GA so it likely was pushed from its normal residence South of Whitewater Creek Golf Club and Fayetteville GA area.  Near Griffen GA a bigfoot was seen by a home owner and a police officer got a good imprint of the large foot print.  (it was near Zubulon GA that is South of Griffen GA) ,We were on the White Water Creek Golf course.  We are members and know the area well.

1266,My mother one night heard a whistle sound about 2am. So we went out to see if somebody was out back. We had a pool deck that was a good 8ft. off the ground. When I stepped up on the step something came toward me so I back up to the front door and shined the flash light out back and it was a good 2ft above the deck with red eyes. It kept movin its head around tryin to get the light out of its eyes. Then it start walking away it would turn and kept looking back a us. When it moved behind my neighbor shed it stop and stick its head out from behind the shed. It was like it was seeing if we was going to follow it. , ,Floyd,8,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13115,yes
1267,This is a reoccurring situation. I have seen prints that looked like giant bare feet in the dirt. It was in the winter time and i know there would be no one walking up the side of a mountain barefoot in those kinds of temperatures.  I noticed i have found them along service roads and along trails by power lines. I suspect they are found there for the same reason i am there. Deer hunting. There are also three lakes and multiple creeks in the same area. I was hunting with my wife and i showed her prints and she wanted to leave real quick. I have seen an actual animal when i was in my teens but i lived in Ohio then. People say that I  m crazy but i know these animals are real. The closest thing that i can compare them to are giant orangutangs. I  m not the smartest guy in the world but i know the woods and every animal that lives there. I know what these are and that they are real. I live in Rome  Georgia  and where i find these tracks are near to where i live but i don  t tell anyone because of the fear some yahoo would try to hunt them. ,Southeast Floyd County  east of US 27.

1269,About a year ago  I was coming home from taking my grandmother to work.  We lived on a paved but heavily wooded road. There are numerous ponds and fields surrounding the area.  As came across the final curve in the road  something caught my eye.  Just on the inside of the ditch by the pond before my house stood a figure.  At first glance I would have thought my eyes to be playing tricks. I slowed down and stopped fearing that I was going to hit a large animal.  I seen this tall figure (roughly 6 feet to 7 feet in height)turn and stare at my headlights.  It was Auburn-Brown and had very wirey hair.  Its head was kinda of oblong like that of monkey.  The face was flat other than the wierd looking nose (looked like a squished pig nose).  Its eyes glowed red in the headlights.  Once I stopped  it immediately turned and crouched into the ditch below.  I was so scared of being attacked that I drove the half mile home  ran inside and told my parents all about it. ,Exact location details withheld per request of the witness  but the sighting took place about six miles east of Moultrie  GA  off of GA Hwy. 37. ,Colquitt,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13071,yes
1270,My wife and I were leaving my parents home  located on the edge of lake Alatoona.  While saying our good-byes outside  the four of us heard an extremely long and loud howl.  The howl lasted about 5 minutes causing several dogs in the area to begin barking and howling themselves in response to the  strange howl. The  unknown  howl wasn  t a dog due to the length of the howl and tone.  After reviewing  the recordings referenced on your home page  both my  parents  wife and I beleive that the  howl  of the  creature in these recordings was almost a perfect  match. ,Acworth  GA ,Cobb,1,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13067,no
1271,On October 7  2009 at about 11 30 pm   my wife and I were returning to Weeki Wachee   Florida from a trip to North Carolina .  We were driving south on US 441 in an unpopulated area at about 65mph. We were about halfway between Homerville and Fargo  which is slightly west of the Okefenokee Swamp . It was very dark with very scant traffic and we were the only car in sight. There were no other lights visible anywhere and no houses or businesses anywhere around.  My wife had turned on the map light because we were getting low on gas and we needed to check the distance to the nearest probable area for gas. She was looking down at the map and didn  t see it   but she  sure smelled it.  Years before   we had been camping in the Okefenokee Swamp and were aware of the wildlife diversity. I have hunting   camping   and Brazilian jungle experience and I am not easily frightened  but this shook me up.   It was an instinctive reaction similar to when you have a surprise encounter with a poisonous snake. I saw a very dark brown/black constant colored tall humanoid figure standing on the left shoulder of the road   quarter facing toward the road and toward the direction of our travel. The figure was standing still   very vertically erect with both arms loosely down at its sides. I couldn  t see any facial features or individual features of hands or feet. I estimate it to be about 7 ft. tall and weigh between 200 and 300 pounds. It was lanky rather than stocky and was not crouching forward   but was standing very vertical. The smell coming into the car vent was very powerfull and was a combination of sewerlike and a strong musky animal odor. There was a small animal roadkill a few yards down the highway that was fresh   so that wouldn  t account for the fowl odor. We conjectured that the creature had smelled the roadkill and came out of the woods to investigate. The hair on the head was long and stringy  but the rest of the body hair seemed only two or three inches long and layed down rather than sticking out in a fuzzy fashion. The thing that struck me was that I couldn  t see any facial features or varied colors around the hand areas. We thought about turning around to re- investigate   but in the middle of the night   I frankly didn  t think it was prudent.  We proceeded to the next major intersection to buy gas  and I asked the station employees if anyone else had mentioned something unusual or if there were any kind of unusual wildlife sightings in the area. They answered  no .  That was the end of our incident. All but one of the sketches I have ever seen of creatures anything like this   showed a more stocky crouching ape-like creature. What I saw was a tall  lanky   humanoid  creature that looked almost  helmeted  because of the way the head hair fell straight down similar to a woman with long straight hair. I could see no neck . I don  t know what I saw but I will never stop my car at night anywhere that area. , ,Clinch,1,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13065,yes
1272,I am now 33 years old. At the time that I encountered this creature  I was 13. I will write it as it happeded. Me and my family lived in a rural community on the outskirts of Riverdale Ga. Behind our house there was many acres of woods. At that time that area belonged to  a man named Mr. Jackson. There was a huge lake there also  it was called Jackson  s Lake. Mr. Jackson was a cattle farmer. His cattle were on the other side of the lake. There were many trails in those woods and me and my friend Daniel played in them many  many times. It was very easy to loose yourself out there all day. My encounter happened when I walked through these woods to a trailer park that was called Chatue Manner. The trailer park still exists today but is under a different name. I went to visit a friend. I started to notice that it was getting late  and my father had told me that he did not want me in those woods after dark.  This struck me and mother as strange  because we would always be in the woods. My mom would even go in those woods to pick blackberrys. At any rate I decided to obey my father - as I did not want to hear his mouth. I walked to the back of the trailer park and there you have to cross a big raveen. It is like 10-15 ft. down and then up again. I was covered in vegetation and that Georgia red clay. Down in the raveen was a creek  so you would get a little scuffed up. After I crossed that I went up a trail that went up hill by the lake and that curved around and led to my house. After passing the lake  and turing the curve I encountered my father. He said  What are you doing out here?  I said I was just coming back from Pam  s house. He said  Well hurry up and get home . I left him standing there and started for home. I turned back to see what he was doing and he was walking toward the lake. I just kept walking toward my house - when on my right side I heard rustling in the foliage beside me. The foliage was mostly dense tall pine trees with all kinds of honey suckles and black berry vines and muscidine vines. That was the place where me and mom would come to pick blackberrys. I tured and looked and I saw this creature. This thing was massive. I could see him. He was only a few feet away from me. He stood parallel to me.  I was heading north to my house. He too was faced north. I was on a heavily walked clear trail  whereas he was in the shrubs. These little pine trees were taller than him. He was at least 7-8 feet tall. His arms were huge  like the size of thighs  they were very long. His chest was massive as well. This was no skinny creature. I looked at him. He looked at me  and off  off  off  I went running up the trail. I was so scared!!! When I started to run  he did too. He ran right beside me in the shrubs. I would look to my right and see him and the thing would make a loud sound.  It  s like he would exhale and let out a very deep grunt/roar.  I kept running and he kept running beside me in the shrubs. This thing was completly hairy and it  s face was dark but I could tell it was human-like because its head was like that of a human head but hair all over - but not on the face. When I had reached the part of the trail that forked off into an open field of tall grass/wheat like stuff  that is where he stopped. He would not come out of the shrubery. I looked back and seen him crouched there staring at me as I ran and he just was there in the shrubbery. When I made it home I ran in the house shaking like a leaf  and my mom was making supper. I told her what had happened and what I had seen. And she went to look out the dinning glass window. It was a sliding glass window and she said she did  nt see anything. She asked where my father was and I told her. Then she sat down with me at the dining room table and told me that was the reason that he did not want me in those woods. She said that he had told her that he had hemmed it up in a tree one night and that he just stood there in front of it and screamed at it and it would  nt come out of the tree. I never told anyone other than my mother and Daniel and now my 4 boys about that. But there was something in those woods and me and my father werent the only ones that knew it. One day I was watching TV after school (this was before any of this happened) and my father come in and told me to come and help him. I said why? Me and my father DO NOT get along very well. He said because Benji  our dog had got caught in a bear trap on the other side of the lake. I said  WHAT?  He said yes. So we went and tried to free benji and my father had took a macheti. He said he could not open the trap  so he was going to cut his foot off. I said NO!! So I pulled the trap w/ all my might and my father got benji out. Now why had someone set a Bear Trap in the woods? There are no bears in Georgia. The biggest animal besides that Thing I had seen were deer and cows. And the cows were on the other side of the lake  they could not come across one side because of trees and the other side because of a big steel fence. And other times before I had ever encountered this being  Me and my family would go walking in the woods and sometimes we would cross the steel gate over to Mr. Jackson  s land and treck about a mile to a very sandy clear creek. That was the side where the cows were. On many different occasions we would come upon a cow laying on the ground dead with its whole stomach torn out. That was very weird to me  but because I was young and did  nt know much and since my parents did  nt say much I never put 2+2 together until my later 20  s. There was something in those woods but it  s probly long gone by now. There are houses all around that lake and Mr. Jackson no longer lives in his house. The creek where these things happened is called Camp Creek. The lake was called Jackson  s Lake. It was private to him. Although me and Daniel would always play around the woods and the lake. The name of the street was and is Lyle Dr. The town Riverdale Ga. I will never forget when that creature chased me but when I got to that opening I knew that he didnt want to hurt me. Because I know by his massive size and that massive sound that he could have just ripped me apart had he wanted to. Needless to say that I did  nt go in the woods much after that. You are the first people that I have ever told besides my mom and my friend and my kids. ,If you are in Atlanta - you go 75 south to Ga. Hwy 85 and you follow it into Riverdale. Hwy 85 eventually intersections Hwy 138. At that light make a right. Go straight to the 3rd street on the left and that is Lyle Dr. ,Clayton,3,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13063,yes
1273,In 1987  I was 16.  My parents & I lived in a log house (3 stories) in Waleska  on top of a mountain.  My room was in the basement (it was like my own little apartment!). I kept my window open during summer  to catch the cool breeze at night.  One night  I was trying to go to sleep and heard in the distance a loud howling/moaning/screaming sound.  Really hard to describe.  You would expect bears  bobcats and your occasional wart hog around those parts of the woods  but I had never heard this sound before.  It made me literally sick to my stomach.  I laid there in silence  with my Great Dane  who was also startled by the sound.  About 5 minutes later  I heard heavy steps outside my window.  I then smelt something horrific and heard footsteps on the deck. I felt that whatever it was was looking through my window at that point.  My dog was pretty much under the covers  hiding  with me.  Whatever it was seemed to pace back and forth in front of my window for about 2 or 3 minutes and then it paced off. Later  I heard that same wrenching howl/moan/scream thingy.  At that point  I scurried and closed my window.  Needless to say  I had trouble sleeping and did not ever sleep with my window open!  I have continuously had nightmares about Big Foot even to this day!  It is good to read other stories such as mine. , ,Cherokee,15,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13057,no
1274,Ok  have gave it a lot of thought  I will not give exact location  I have lived here my whole life  close to 50 years  so most of the locals know me. But i will say it is in Chattooga County Georgia   just a little north of Floyd County. I leave for work before daylight..I live way out in  the sticks  as folks say. I hadn  t been a mile or so from home  when my headlights caught something  I first took to be some idiot in a monkey suit. but  then  I thought  why on earth would anyone do that  out here in the middle of nowhere  before daylight? I got  I would guess within 20 feet of it  my mind was trying to get some realistic answer.. It was not a bear.. this thing stood  I would guess seven to eight feet??? this thing  stood upright just like you and me does.. it stopped about in the middle of the road  I stopped to keep from hitting it... still unsure of what it was... I got a VERY GOOD look at it.. what it was? i don  t know. what i saw? looked just like a big huge monkey walking up right just like you and me do. Will some people say I  m crazy? sure they will.. that  s ok. i wouldn  t believe it ether  if I hadn  t been the one that seen it. ,I will ONLY give this in the strictest of confidence.. ,Chattooga,1,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13055,yes
1275,I think it was 2nd or 3rd Jan. 1976. I was active duty and stationed at Hunter Army Airfield. one of my Army Buddies and our wives went out to Little Tybee Island on a Camping hunting trip. We had a nicely sheltered tent inland about two hundred yards off the beach behind the dunes. The first night out was cold. It got into the high teens. The local forcast predicted record lows the next day and night. Our wives were cold and wanted to go in. We transported them back to Tybee  and we went back out for an afternoon hunt. By 1600 hrs it was too cold to stay out. Our lab was coming out of the water with ice coating her. We returned to camp and had a warm fire going  ate an early supper  and retired early. It was too cold to sit up. At aproximately 2200 hrs I awaken to our lab growling softly. Jim was awake too. He asked me   Robbie  is your gun loaded?  I assured him it was. We then heard a two legged creature walking toward our tent from the rear. I say a two legged creature because Men walk differently from deer. At that time there were no deer  or hogs on Little Tybee  Although now there are. The creature stopped aproximately 30 to 40 feet from our tent.(Our tent was in a small valley  and wouldnt be visible to someone coming from the backside of the Island unil they were upon it.)There was a minute or two of complete silence. Even my Lab was extremely quiet  she acted scared for the first time I had ever seen. There was then a whooshing sound of something large whirling through the air  it struck out tent with a tremendous whump. The dog went nuts. We both unassed the tent with our six volt headlights on and our shotguns at port arms. I caught a glimpse of something very dark colored and man sized running towards the backside of the Island. I noticed an odor tha I can only describe as a cross between grey fox and civit cat  in the air. We ran after it out to the edge of the open marsh. It clearly coul run faster without lights than we could with lights. I never got close enough for a positive visual.There is nothing on the backside of Little Tybee  except miles on open salt marsh  tidal rivers and creeks and dozens of smaller hammocks and small islands. No man could or would hav exposed himself to that marsh in those temperatures. The marsh itself was frozen hard  but the creeks wern  t. Under those conditions a man would perish in minutes if he got wet in salt water. We checked the only other boat landing on the island  the creek intrance on the northeastern end of the island. There was no boat or evidence of one being there. We walked the entire beach looking for prints  or other boats  and we were the only boat on the beach. We discussed the incident awhile and concluded that we just may have had a sasquatch encounter. At the time I felt that this was unlikely as all the encounters I had ever heard of was in the Pacific Northwest. Over the years since I have come to realize that the Bigfoot egnima is world wide  in all wild places. ,Little Tybee Island lies across Tybee  s Back River  and slightly southwest. It is an uninhabited & Wild Barrier Island  It has never been a habitat for man. People visit it  and usually only in summer. ,Chatham,1,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13051,no
1276,MY brother and I were fishing on wolf creek in a area known as high shoals. This area is heavily wooded with steep terrain and a rushing waterfall. We had park our truck at the top of the hill and walk down the trail to the creek below. We had been fishing about a hour and had no luck when we decided to move upstream. We got our gear together and starting walking up the shoals and heard a large splash hit the water up ahead. We first thought it was a rock that had rolled of the side of the steep terrain when suddenly a large black/brown human like creature was slashing at the water with it  s long arms. The creature never new we were there and we must have viewed him for 2-3 mins playing around in the water. We never moved only making eye contact with each other. Suddenly it darted off to the right up the steep terrain not knowing whether it had seen us or not. We never got a good look at it  s face. It must have been 6-7ft. around 300-400lbs. and look very healthly. We were around 25-30yds from it. We kept this to ourselves for quite a while only shareing it with family members . We have returned to the area several times and have never seen it again but have seen unexplained markings when no bear is to be in the area. ,The area is steep terrain in some places clear cut in some and very wooded in others. This is a very remote area with several thousands of acres. There is plenty of game in the area and a well known whitetail hunting area. ,Carroll,15,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13045,yes
1277,I am about to graduate with a BS in Biology  and want that noted. The incidents began in the fall of 2004. It started out as hearing strange howling sounds in the evening. I never heard the vocalizations in the day time.  In the fall of 2004 some friends and I went camping on my driveway. It was the middle of October  and around 2 in the morning I heard a loud grunting sound and trees snapping. The noises were so loud that they woke me up. It was a full moon that night and clear  and when I opened the window on the tent I could not believe what I was seeing. I saw a large dark figure with eyes that seemed to illuminate red in the moonlight. It was beating something in the head which I found to be a deer come sun up. The creature drug the deer up to the top of the hill above the camp sight. It walked up on top of some big rocks and I could make it out perfectly. 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in hair. The one friend who stayed the evening saw the exact same thing. I watched it eat the deer. It pulled off appendages like it was nothing. Shortly after it started eating it noticed our tent. It walked right down to the side of the tent  and the smell coming off of it was intensely musky. It knocked the frying pan out of the tree by the tent as it was walking by  and when it hit the ground  it ran back to the top of the hill. The deer carcass was gone  but hair and intestines were left behind. The liver  spleen  heart and lungs must have been eaten. We followed the drag marks from the carcass and found a mass of pine trees bent and broken into some form of shelter. I have many other encounters that I can share. They are real and they are here. I have had rocks thrown at me  and I have been charged by one twice. I barely got inside the house both times. They do not like light  and they do not like it if you shine a light directly at them. I say them because on more than one occasion my fiancÃ© and I heard at least three. Hardwoods and swamps surround my house. When this started there were many subdivisions going in  and massive habitat loss which had to drive them to my property. There is also a 20 000 acre national forest that is squatchy as all get out about 7 miles from my home. The sounds are not as frequent now  but they can still be heard from time to time here. I only hear them in fall and winter though. I am also a hunter  and when I was hearing the Squatches every night  there was not a deer to be found. When I did see deer they were very jumpy. This was during archery season that I made this observation  therefore no gun shots were occurring to spook them. I promise you from the bottom of my heart that they are real. I have seen them in person more than once. If the wind is right you know when they are close because of the smell. ,Halls Bridge road runs parallel to Jackson Lake.

1278,My wife and I were returning from TMT Farms Christmas display when a bigfoot crossed the road in front of us. At first I wasnâ€™t sure what I saw but my wife asked me if I saw that. It was a big creature  7-8 feet tall  and crossed the road from left to right in 4 steps. It crossed the road and made its way into the woods. ,[Investigator Note  The road crossing happened on Lakeview Road almost precisely one mile south of Blitch and eight miles north of Statesboro.

1279,I was down at a place we call the Clay Hills outside of a town called Hoboken. I herd a noise that sounded like foot steps in the woods. I didn  t think mutch of it at first but I kept hearing it so I looked up an it was looking at me. I moved the shovel I was digging with an it turned an ran back in the woods. Then a few minutes later I had a weired feeling something was behind me. Then I heared movement I turned an looked it was behind me an getting closer. I have lived in the swamps all my life. I  m not scared of mutch but I admit I was nervous. It watched me for a while then walked into the swamp an disapered. Both times was close to fruit during the fall when the plumbs an pears were the sweetest. The second time was one night I was coming home from my girl friends. I passed the corn feild on my left. A little further up there is another feild that was grown up with briers so thick a man could not go threw with 4 pair of pants on but something stood up and ran threw them like they werent there. The next day I went back looking for prints I found one print. It was about 6 in longer than mine an I wear a size 12. ,When you get into town comming off hyw 95 onto 82 west turn left at first caution light. Go 3 miles out of town take left on dirt road.

1280,I haven  t told this too often but this is exactly what happened.  Macon  Georgia. I was 10 or 11 yrs old  1956-57. My house was on a main highway with some homes scattered behind it  then miles of woods. My friend and I had been at the creek in the woods behind my house  maybe 3/4 mile from my house. It was getting dark  summer  and we were heading home. I was almost home  house was 100 yds away. Not scared  almost home  never had heard of Bigfoot. There was a gulley to our right with a trail in the shallow end of the gulley we used as a path. I heard a loud clomping sound coming toward us on the other side of the gulley  swishing thru the small pines coming down the path toward us.  I thought it was a mule that had gotten out and I would try to catch it. That is how loud it sounded as it came toward us. When it came up on our side of the gulley I saw a large ape/man like hairy creature jogging toward us on the path on two legs. Needless to say my friend and I didn  t stay around for an extended look  maybe two to three seconds of observation then we took off. The creature was probably close to six/seven feet tall. It looked like that video [Patterson-Gimlin film]. When we told our parents and playmates we were the subject of much ridicule  that is until about a week or so later when five or so of them were down at the creek damming it up. I wasn  t with them as I no longer played in the woods. Well they saw the thing  this was the middle of the day  as they came running out of the woods  some of them crying they were so shaken. Their parents called the sheriff and he said it was probably a bear. It wasn  t. It was no hoax with someone in a suit. ,The location is in Bibb County  less than a mile from the Jones County line. ,Bibb,2,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13021,yes
1281,I will start this with what my uncle had always told me and my father about what he called the monkey people (thought he was B.S.). On the second weekend in Oct. 1976 First day of bird hunting season I had stopped in the morning and set 4 catfish lines on the Alapaha river where it joined my uncles land (2 miles from Alapaha Ga. on US Hwy 82 east) This area is known as the [little lot] by local old timers. After I had finished hunting at just about dark - 7PM or so.I stopped back to see if I had any catfish this is on a winding private dirt at least a mile and a half from my uncles home. I had left my gun in the truck and only had my pocket knife to cut the lines-as I worked with the lines I heard a sound I had never heard before very deep very loud breathing then I smelled a strange smell the smell made me feel uneasy I was unable to see anything but as I backed towards the truck it moved out into a clearing and I was able to see it from about 10 feet. At around 6 foot tall it looked wet as if it had came from the river it also had green river scum on its left leg and side. It stopped dead still when it seen me and I wasted no time getting the hell out of there. ,2 miles east of Alapaha Ga on 82 hwy right on Ocilla road 500 ft right on dirt road (farm road) then one & half miles. ,Berrien,6,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13019,yes
1282,My father had been outside working on the back deck  when he heard  what he calls a  squal  or scream coming from the same direction as the howl that was reported earlier this month.

I had asked my parents to let me know if there were any further occurences. ,Between Lake Allatoona and Red Top mountain state park ,Bartow,4,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13015,no

The dogs in the neighborhood responded in the same manner of howling and barking in response to the unknown howl. ,Acworth  near Lake Allatoona ,Bartow,4,Georgia ,GA,Spring ,13015,no
1284,I am reporting this as a second hand report as my husband is the one who actually had the sighting. He is reluctant to share it with too many people and was stoutly a non believer in such things. He is a truck driver and was doing his usual Sunday courier run around 2 30 am to Tennessee. He was traveling on Hwy 75 North at exit 285  at Redtop Mountain  when he noticed a large biped figure walking into the tree line of the median between the southbound & northbound lanes. He said it was about 8 1/2 ft to 9 ft tall  greyish in color. He could not make out any other details. He only saw it because its movements caught his attention to that side of the road. ,From Atlanta  go north on I-75 to Exit 285.

1286,I was fishing on a wetland area that is owned by my family. My mother  grandmother  3 yr old daughter and son were with me. This is an isolated farm that I don  t want to I.D. any further online to keep lurkers off the property. It is loaded with wildlife. We were sitting spread out along a small channel. My mother  grandmother and daughter were at the end of the channel and my son who was around 7 at the time  was sitting next to me. My daughter was crying because she was getting in trouble for getting too close to the water  s edge. It should be noted there are a ton of alligators in the wetland and the channel. I had looked in their direction several times and on the last time I caught movement from the corner of my eye. I sat quietly trying to get a better look at what was moving. It was across the channel from us in a densely wooded area. I was worried it was a bear. Then it stepped out of the trees and was looking in the direction of my daughter crying. It stood there for about 30 seconds before slipping back behind another tree. I didn  t alert my family at the moment hoping to catch another view of it. It was very large  around 7-8 feet. Broad shoulders with shaggy matted fur. It stood on its back legs and appeared to be brownish to dark brown with some lighter brown to grey around the facial area. It  s arms hung down at it  s side as a human would. It made no sounds except the crunching of leaves and a breaking of a small stick here and there as it left the area. I didn  t notice any abnormal sounds prior to me seeing it move. It walked away when my daughter stopped crying. I do believe it was only curious as to her crying. It didn  t seem aggressive in its stance or movement. It seemed to just be sneaking a peek. I have no clue how long it had been watching us. I never felt in danger either. I did notice a skunk/trash type odor after the sighting but not during. I decided it was time to leave after about 30 min of no further sightings and only told my family once we were in the vehicle to leave. ,A 100+ acre family farm outside Ray City  GA. ,Berrien,6,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13019,yes
1287,This past wednesday night I was watching TV in my game room above the garage. It was around twelve or twelve thirty when it sounded like something hit one of the garage doors. I waited about five seconds before I looked out the window because it freaked me out a little. I then looked out the window to see a large thing  well over six feet tall  covered in hair right below the window. The hair was almost dread like  it was long and matted. When I saw it it was already heading back into the woods. It was gone within two seconds. , ,Berrien,6,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13019,yes
1288,Last December in Brooks County Georgia in the early hours of the morning I was driving home to Florida on Clyattville Road. I was approaching the longest bridge between ROCKY FORD ROAD & Rt 53  I saw something that looked like very tall man standing near the side of the bridge. I had my bright lights on  so I flashed my lights to warn this pedestrian at this hour that I was approaching. I then tapped the horn  but this very large figure didn  t run. It appeared as I drew closer to be reaching for something beyond the bridge  (perhaps leaves of the trees) I began to slow down as I approached the bridge  fearing this very big man was drunk  and would stagger in front of my car. But as I approached the object I saw this was either a GIANT of a man in a shaggy fur coat  or a HUGH animal I had never seen! It was standing on two feet  and its arms were long  this I noticed as it turned its head toward the car  it dropped one arm to its side. I cannot describe its face  because I was  SCARED  nearly to   because as it turned its head my lights reflecked in its eye  and it glowed RED  instead of green  or yellow  as I am used to seeing from animals I had viewed at night on the road. I was scared so bad I raced home  but didn  t mention this until weeks later to even my husband  because I was trying to rationalize this in my mind as fatigue  night illusions whatever I could label it. Besides I was afraid of being told I was crazy. I am a professional that needs to remain sane in the public  s eye! I would very much like to get some feed back on this  but I positively do NOT want my name  or profile mentioned on the internet! I am willing to work with anyone that is serious about finding what this is but I must maintain a low public profile  because not only am I a professional  but I am a woman!

1290,Date  October 2003. Place  Cherokee County  Georgia Conditions  Clear  Crisp Weekday Morning I live in Cheokee County  Georgia in a semi-rural area of small horse farms and subdivisions. My ususal routine is to walk my two dogs early in the morning off my property on an improved road and back to the house. Upon entering the house at approx 5 45 AM we (the dogs and I) were startled by a series of very loud  vocalizations  coming from the direction of our horse barn (approx 200 ft away beyond a creek and tree line). At this time of morning I am familiar with the usual sounds of the area  including dogs  cats  horses  etc.  This was like nothing I have ever heard before as it was very wild and loud animalistic  yell   but with a human vocal quality that immediately caught my attention. The second  yell  was almost  monkey-like  vocalizations and moving off to the western edge of the property. I went down to feed the horses and did not see or hear anything unusual. I have not looked for tracks or evidence as of four days later. ,Southern Cherokee County approximately 30 miles northwest of Atlanta ,Cherokee,15,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13057,no
1291,At 8 12 pm on Saturday  Feb.14  2009 my husband and I were in our upstairs bedroom with the windows open when we heard a very unusual sound from outside. I turned down the television and we listened at our open window and heard the sound again. It was an animal sound coming from the wooded areas around our house. I could only describe the sound as a monkey-like whooping sound. The animal made this series of whooping sounds only twice.The neighborhood dogs responded by barking. My husband quickly told me that he had heard unusual animal calls the night before while letting our dogs out in the yard. We are very familiar with the usual wildlife that frequents this area and neither of us have ever heard anything similar before. ,Our neighborhood is near Red Top Mountain and Lake Allatoona. ,Cherokee,15,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13057,no
1292,My girlfriend and I was returning home in the early morning hours  around 3am  on the date of June 28th 2009. I play lead guitar in a well known band in the Atlanta area. For this  it  s late when I do come home. We live in a area that is very rural with lots of farming land and needless to say we are surrounded by woods. On this particular night we were less than a half of a mile from home. We were traveling past a pasture when I saw a figure cross the road in front of me. My girlfriend also seen it and asked me if I had saw it. I told her yes but that was the last we spoke of it untill later that day. We started describing to each other what we had seen and the first thing I told her that it looked to me like it had reddish colored hair. Then I said to her that I didn  t want her to think I was crazy but it looked to me like it was walking on 2 legs...not 4. As I said this to her her I could see that she was shocked by what I told her. Then I asked her what she had seen. She had seen the same thing and even told me that whatever it was had reddish eyes. We saw a creature that stood about 6ft. Tall and moved rapidly from left to the right side of the road ,Off Hwy 140 ,Cherokee,15,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13057,yes
1293,I have heard a strange â€œmournful howlingâ€ (as Iâ€™ve heard it described) several times in the middle of the night  but last night it was only 50 feet from my house at 2am. It was a loud howl like humanoid or larger  not a dog.. I grabbed my rifle and opened the door and immediately it stopped. About 30 minutes go by and i hear it again. This time sounds like itâ€™s a quarter mile away (but very loud). I have been researching all types of animals that could make such a noise and have found no answers  except Sasquatch. I have heard the noise 4 or 5 times within a 3 year period of living here  always in late November or December. ,Whitestone Dr  Canton GA [Investigator (MM) notes  GPS Coordinates for location of howler 34.173506  -84.464559 ,Cherokee,15,Georgia ,GA,Winter ,13057,no
1294,I was playing paint ball with my son  and some kids he was freinds with  about summertime 2003. I had taken the youngest child(about 6) with me  and the other kids(mostly late teens) were looking for us. We were hiding in an overgrown ditch near our home  in a fairly populus  rural area. We both heard a strange groaning noise coming from the direction of some nearby appartments. The little boy I was with  was quite afraid  and wanted to go inside. I scared him so bad  he was crying. We went inside  and I told my wife  the boys mother  and the other kids about the sound. We all went into the yard  and heard the groans. I just listened to the Mississippi groans  and that was what i heard. I also checked to see if there was anymore sightings in my area  and I am about 25 miles from the Lanier county Georgia sighting. ,Turn left on hwy 441/221 at the hwy 82 intersection(center of Pearson)  go south for 1/4 mile  and turn left on Cogdell hwy  for approximatly 2 miles. ,Atkinson,3,Georgia ,GA,Summer ,13003,no
1295,I was in South Georgia at a Hunting Camp I had just joined that year.  I was leaving the camp site and driving throught the planted pines (maintained dirt roads) to go to my stand.  Directly behind camp is approx 30 - 50 acres that no one is allowed to hunt for safety purposes.  There is also a small pond in this area.  Driving about 1/4 mile from camp  I looked to my left in the pines and noticed something black.  I was approaching an intersection  so I slowed to see what would emerge from the woods.  To my surprsie  a black  animal  came out of the woods on all fours  angled 45 degrees away from me.  I tried to convince myself I was seeing a bear  or possibly a cow that got loose.  However  as I watched from 50 feet I noticed the complete absence of a tail.  I watched the animal in the open road  in broad day light for 10 seconds.  It came directly out of the woods  and ran down the road then crossed into the opposing woods and disappeared.  I could see that the rear legs appeared longer than the front  and the head was closer to the ground.  Also  as it ran on all fours the animal loped  with the slope of the back changing rather than remaining level.  As if the front was bouncing.  Further  the legs and rear were much too thin to be that of a bear.  Though I did not see the  face  - from the limited sight of the head  there were no clearly visible ears.  A bear  s ears would be clearly visible.  I immediately thought of Sasquatch  however I was seeing an animal running on all fours... I have just seen the Jacobs photo - and that is the best way I can describe what I saw in South Georgia. , ,Atkinson,3,Georgia ,GA,Fall ,13003,yes
1296,I commute daily to work driving 49 miles one way each day. My route is from Coffee County Georgia to Tift County Georgia. I  ve been commuting over a year now. The date was early November  2011. The time was approximately 9 00 am. It was a clear  cool sunny day. I was on Hwy 82 West heading to Tifton when I was about a mile out of Willacoochee  Georgia  I looked over to the left  as I have always scanned the woods as I  m driving to work. I noticed at the edge of the opening in the woods  a very large creature just standing there. It was all covered in black hair and its arms were dangling to its sides  which is what made me notice it in the first place.I  d say it was over 8 feet tall. It was huge!! I think it saw me too  looking at it. When I first spotted this  I slammed on my brakes as I was getting ready to accelerate on the highway at that moment. Now because I had a medium strip between me and the other side I didn  t have a chance to turn around and get over on the side of highway I  d seen it at. I had to get going onto work so I just kept going. I wish I would have turned around up the highway and went back and maybe it might have still been there. But I did not want to be late for work. ,Approximately 1.3 miles west of Willacoochee  GA. Right off the highway at edge of woods on left side of highway.

1812,We were sitting in the blind it was very misty out. I had fell asleep and my son said I was snoring.he then shook me a little and said dad something is coming I woke and immediatley heard something big moving through the brush and fast. It came up behind the blind and screamed I immediatley knew it was nothing I have ever heard before my son was almost in tears. It then started stomping so hard it was shaking the ground and started snapping limbs and grunting and growling.

1813,I was a commercial fisherman for 8 years and me and my dad fished the Ohio River from Cairo  to West Virginia. The sighting was at Uniontown dam  at Uniontown  Ky. My mother come to pick us up around 1 or 2 am. and she seen it cross the road in front of her in the headlights  she said  it walked right in front of the lights and turned its head and looked towards the truck  never stopped just slowly walking across the road about 50 ft. in front on the truck  she said it was about 9 or 10 ft tall and went in a strip of woods on the river bank. When we got there she was shaking all over and had all the doors locked and windows rolled up. She would not come pick us up there without a gun in the truck after that. Me and my father heard sounds on a island below the dam where we fished for weeks after that at night when we were fishing. Sounds like  a large animal walking through brush on 2 legs  stomping trough the water in the back of the chute where we were fishing  the water was about 4 feet deep and the animal was walking on 2 legs. It had to be tall to be stomping trough the water the way it was. We could hear it breaking logs when it stepped on them and pretty good size logs from the sound it made and no deer or anything else is going to do that.   ,Right below Uniontown Dam on the Ky bank. There is a dike just below the dam  the sighting happened there. ,Union,14,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21225,yes
1814,Me and a friend were near barkley lake late at night. We got way off in a place on a dirt road stopped for minute to smoke down by the water  barkley lake. I was setting in the car talking looked up the road we came down and saw what looked like a big man walking down to where we were.  I turned on my head lights to see what or who it was. It run off in the woods. Well  we sat a minute then a smell like a wet animal started to came in the car. We heard a loud crashing comeing the woods and yelling screams. At that time a log came flying and hit my car. It moved my 1980 caddy it hit so hard. I started  the hit gas and was gone. We came back the next day to look around the log was there it was so heavy we could no move it we walk over where it must have came from in the woods it was 40 yards away. , ,Trigg,4,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21221,yes
1815, In 1977 my husband and I bought a small hobby farm in Taylor County  Kentucky.....just outside the town of Campbellsville.   Our farm was surrounded by neighboring farms  but no one lived on the land bordering ours  the owners all lived in town.  So  our little farm was fairly isolated and I liked it that way.  In the summer of 1978  I believe the month was July  my husband while alone at home  heard a sound one evening  that frightened the daylights out of him.......and he doesn  t frighten easily.    He called me at a friend  s place  screaming at me   where are the shotgun shells ? .    His attitude  his franticness  scared me.  I didn  t know what was going on and he wouldn  t tell me.....he just kept screaming  where are the shotgun shells ? .    I finally told him and he slammed the phone down.     It wasn  t until later  that my husband related the story of what he had heard.      He never did see anything and years went by with no answers to that   cry   he had heard that evening.  (Although  for the first several years  as we watched   nature   films  which had various wildlife   cries    I kept asking him.......did it sound like that ?   To which he always replied  No  it was like nothing I had ever heard before .)  Now  it  s 1988  again in the summer  and the month is August.  It had just started to turn dark in the evening  when my husband came in from outside and all he said was  Do you want to hear that sound ?     He didn  t have to say anymore.  I knew right away what he was referring to  so we both went back outside and stood outside our kitchen window.   I was standing there listening when I told him  I don  t hear anything .  He quickly replied...... Shhh.....just wait .    So I continued to listen.   All of a sudden this horrible   cry   came up from our woods  where our two creeks merged.  It caused chills to run up and down my spine!  My first reaction was shock.  Then another   cry   was heard.   This time  I felt myself slowly edging backwards towards the house.  Whatever this   thing   was.....the   cry   was like nothing I had heard from any wild animal before and I remember starting to shake with fear.    Then another   cry   was heard  this time it came from across the road in the woods  where the creek continued to flow.   This cry hadn  t even  cresendoed   when there was another cry  heard from our side of the woods again.   Oh my God.......there were  two  of them I thought!!   That was it  I turned and ran into the house.   My husband came in with me  but he grabbed the shotgun and went back outside.   He wanted me to hold the light for him  as he investigated the woods.....and I stated  You  re out of your mind  I  m not going back out there!   That basically was all that happened that night.  My husband never saw anything  nor did I.   But I did smell something.....it was a very strong musty odor  that wasn  t pleasant.   Actually  the odor was like wafting across with the gentle breeze.....so sometimes it was very light  and sometimes much stronger.  I remember wrinkling up my nose  when it was strong  and thinking  what on earth is that smell ?   So now  after 10 years  I had heard the same sound that my husband had heard alone back in 1978.  The next day  I did go down to where the two creeks meet and walked along the banks  looking for strange prints  but didn  t see any.   Even though it was broad daylight  and a gorgeous sunny day......just being down there gave me the creeps.   What had happened the night before  had really shook me up and never again did I enjoy being down there anymore.    Just the replay in my mind of those   cries    was enough to make me   jumpy   whenever I was close to the woods/creeks area again.  The sound of those   cries   stuck in my mind....and I had a knawing feeling  that I had heard that sound before......but   where   ???    I was a video collector back then (still am) and quickly went through all of my video collection  to see if anything would jog my memory.    I have many natural wildlife tapes  so I thought  maybe that is where I had heard it.  But when I came across a movie entitled  Sasquatch   a feeling inside of me  told me to watch this tape.......so I did.   I sat in my living room and watched all the way through that movie  until close to the end....they had the sound......the very same sound......that my husband and I had just heard a few nights ago!!     As soon as I heard it  chills again ran up and down my spine.   I quickly rewound the tape  to the beginning of where that  sound  was and left it there until my husband came home from work that evening.    As soon as he came home  I told him I had something I wanted him to watch.   So within a few minutes  he was seated in the living room and I played the tape.   As soon as that   cry   was heard on the tape  he jumped up yelling  That  s it!.......That  s the sound!!

1816,Me and my boyfriend at the time were rideing his four wheeler in the creek. We had just got to a deep spot so he was trying to make sure he didnt drown it out i glanced to the left and thought i seen somthing big and furry standing in the  cane weeds i am 5  3 and the weeds were about 2 foot taller than me and it was about 2 foot taller than them i was about 15 to 20 yards from it i looked back over there and hopeing it wasnt what i thought it was and it seen me and turned and hunkered down and ran off its its back was about 3ft wide and it was a light brown in color. ,I 65 S left on 100 4th rd to right go to stop sign take a left there is a bridge and thats where it was to the left of the bridge is where we were. ,Simpson,2,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21213,yes
1817,November 20  2011 Was deer hunting on the farm behind my house like ever year before. That season I used my hunting blind that I had setup a few days before. It had been raining that morning so I used the 4 wheeler to get back to the blind. I parked it beside the blind and took my stuff in. I poured a cup of coffee and opened a bag of donuts and loaded the gun. I could hear something step over the fence (normal sized person could not do that) this fence is double wide with extra electric wire. Then the foot steps continued to come closer to the blind. The foot steps sounded really heavy. The foot steps came to the side of the blind and stopped. I could hear heavy breathing and then it leaned over the blind . I could see a impression of a nose pushing down on the top of the center of the blind. The blind I have is 6 feet tall  this means he had to be at least 8 feet plus tall. The nose imprint began sniffing and leaning more on the top of the blind. This point I was getting really nervous  so I took the safety off on the gun and said ( if you are a person you better leave  if your a bigfoot then you better not growl or howl our push any harder on the blind cause I  m gonna start blowing holes in something . Then the sniffing stopped while I said my little speech  but then started again more aggressively. I told myself to stay calm  and then the subject stood upward and walked around the blind and then over to the woods. I tried looking out the window but could not see anything.. Scared the holy-**it out of me .. ,Jacksonville outside of Bagdad  KY in north Shelby county ,Shelby,9,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21211,yes
1818,August 12-2012 2 30am I first heard a howl at 2 30 am less than 50 yards behind the house in the tree line. I walked out on too the porch with the spotlight and searched the tree line but could not see anything. Less than 5 minutes later I heard the howl again then immediately another howl less than 40 yards from me. I still could not see anything. Then the next howl was behind the garage and howled twice. I then eased back into the house and quietly closed the screen door. Suddenly there were small rocks hitting the porch roof  this lasted about 7-8 minutes. I went to the bedroom to wake my wife up to tell her what was happening. She of course didn  t believe what I was telling her. Within 5-10 minutes she heard 2 howls to the left of the house about 75 yards from the house. No more then 10 minutes later we both heard 2 more howls across the road around 100 yards. Around 30 minutes later I heard one more howl back to the right of the house about 150 yards out. Quiet rest of the morning. I know what coyotes sound like  this was no coyote. This made the hair stand up on the back of your neck. ,Jacksonville  KY  just outside of Bagdad in north Shelby county. ,Shelby,9,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21211,no
1819,This sighting occurred while doing a Paranormal Investigation at Octagon Hall in Franklin  Kentucky. Upon arrival  we talked to the curator of the property and he advised us that an investigator from the previous night had a possible Bigfoot sighting. He also produced a cell phone picture taken the next day of the fields about 3/4 of a mile away where the sighting took place. Around 2 a.m. a teammate and myself headed out to investigate the area in question. There is a large clump of hardwood trees and other foliage (about 3/4 mile long & 1/2 mile wide) in the middle of the otherwise barren field I vocalized a loud  whoop  a few times with no results. As time passed I decided to try the loudest  most guttural howl I could muster. I performed the call and heard two responses from a mile or so in the distance  but thought it could be the echo from the howl. A few minutes later my fellow investigator and I saw movement beside one of the trees about 30 - 40 yards away. We both stood still and saw a large silhouette of a humanoid figure peek out from behind a tree. It swayed left 3 times  paused; then sway 2-3 times to the right and stop.Since we weren  t using our flashlights  our eyes were very attuned to the darkness.The figure was around 7 feet plus in height  the 1/2 of a large head  shoulder and arms that were past the knees.This activity continued foe a few minutes  to the point that I asked my fellow investigator if he was seeing what I was seeing. We actually took turns mimicking the movement as it happened. First me  then him. The timing and movement was exactly the same in real time as what we were viewing. We initially thought it could be a  shadow figure  of a large Civil War soldier  but the height  arm length and recent activity on the property prompted me to conclude that it was a flesh and blood Bigfoot sighting and not of a spiritual nature. When we tried to get closer to the figure it retreated for a final time     and was no longer there. We both went to the tree and there was nothing there that could explain the dark figure we both saw. ,Octagon Hall 6040 Bowling Green Rd Franklin  Ky ,Simpson,2,Kentucky ,KY,Spring ,21213,no
1820,Part of my travel route to work is along Kentucky State Route 164 from Kentucky State Route 807 to U.S. Route 68 at Canton  KY in Trigg County.  I was driving along jamming on the radio  but looking for deer.  Deer are constantly running out in front of vehicles and causing accidents.  So I try to stay alert for the deer.  On this day I saw much more that I bargained for.  There on the side of the road in the edge of the woods was a bigfoot.  It was just standing there watching me drive by.  It did not seem violent or mean spirited.  It was at least 10 feet tall and covered with thick black hair.  I  ve watched for it every since then and have yet to see it again. ,It was on Kentucky State Route 164 between mile markers 3 and 4. ,Trigg,4,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21221,yes
1821,My encounter took place while leaving the Lake Barkley Resort.  My family and I were driving back toward the main road that leads to Cadiz  KY.  I was going about 50 miles per hour when I saw a deer run across the road. I thought I saw a tree next to the road but it was running.  It was taller then the top of my mini van and looked right at me   we passed it in about 3 seconds.  I was not really sure what I saw so I turned around to see if it might have been a tree or something but there was nothing there.  I remember afterwards that it was a large creature  with tanish/brown fur around 7 feet tall with an almost Neanderthal brow and flatish nose.  It was hard to tell what color the fur was exactly since my headlights are tinted yellow. My son who was in the back seat also saw it and commented on it. The animal was running upright along the edge of the road. it seemed to be chasing a deer that had run in front of our van literally seconds before. It kept pace with me for about 3 steps then dropped back. When I looked in the rear view mirror  it had run off. ,From Cadiz  KY - follow 68 West heading towards Land Between the Lakes.

1822,This is my Facebook post. Copied and pasted. Occurrence was inside Land Between the Lakes National Forest  Hillman Ferry Campground at Campsite B 43. Well. I made sure we secured the most backcountry spot where you can dump camp. I wanted away from loud people. So it is empty and quiet; covered with plenty of trees. So at about 4am  I wake up  instantly. I ask my wife what  s the matter. She simply whispered she was scared. I ask about what. She said she heard noises out in the woods. Now normally  I would ask her to go back to sleep  that there  s nothing wrong. But this time. Suddenly  about maybe five or six owls start hooting. And they  re going non stop  back to back. Then the coyotes begin howling with them. And then every bird wakes up and begins their story. They go on continuously for about thirty seconds. Suddenly  they all stop. And so I know this is completely unusual. Then we hear it. Clump  Clump  Clump  Clump. Branches were breaking  wood was cracking with each step. And I  m like okay  that  s a biped. But a human  unless it was intentionally trying to be frightening  wouldn  t be tromping around. And an adult would know and expect people to have firearms. Also  the terrain would be too difficult to simply decide to go for a stroll in the woods in the middle of the night  with no guarantee to meet somebody to scare. During the day  the forest is too dense for hunting. I know there are no bears  I know it  s not a deer  or any other woodland creature that is common here. So. It keeps getting closer and closer. So I cough really loud. No change in its cadence. It sounded like how I would sound walking through the woods. Heavy and sweating  full of complaints. These steps were loud. So I get out. The flashlight is in the truck. I go to the truck and rummage around for it. And I  m naked  carrying a knife in my mouth  searching through the vehicle. So I find it  and then start searching the treeline. I see nothing. But the steps stop. So  I start up the vehicle and point it towards the woods. I turn on the high beams. Nothing. I get out  turn off the lights. Start to head back to the tent  and then suddenly  Boom  boom  boom. It runs off. Tree limbs were breaking  trees were swaying. And I could hear it exhale as it ran. Sound like a combination of a boar and a man. And so  if you  re familiar with Land Between the Lakes  there  s a huge dogman or big foot phenomenon here. Tons of stories on YouTube about here. So I don  t know. We both experienced it. Pretty crazy. , ,Trigg,4,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21221,yes
1823,My name is Pam Lovins. I am a BFRO investigator in West Virginia. Earlier this summer I got a call from another BFRO investigator about a situation in eastern Kentucky  not too far away from my location.  I was the closest person so I was asked to look into it -- ongoing activity near Cave Run Lake. After multiple phone conversations with the reporting witnesses  I traveled to the site to see the location and meet the people. I arrived in the afternoon and met several family members. They were a local family who frequently camped near the lake in the summer. They told me about various Class B incidents at night  and at least one Class A sighting in headlights at close range. That last incident occurred only a few days before I arrived. I arrived in the afternoon and met several family members  most of whom had witnessed or heard something at some point during the previous few weeks. As dusk approached  two of the witnesses (two young men) hiked with me to a nearby hill where most of the activity seemed to emanate from.  We had with us a Sony nite-shot infra-red camcorder and at set of gen-3 nightvision goggles. These two witnesses  Chuck and Dusty  along with a few of their friends  had hiked up this same hill several weeks earlier. On that occasion Chuck was struck in the head by a rock. He was slightly injured from it -- had a minor cut in his scalp from the rock. None of these guys had returned to go back up there until this day. The three of us worked our way to the top of the ridge  stopping periodically to check multiple broken trees and branches.  It wasn  t long before something was thrown against a rock formation as we were passing by.  We stopped and decided to split up briefly. Dusty went with me  carefully flanking one side of the rocky ridge. Chuck flanked the other side of the ridge. We eventually met up at the top of the ridge. At the very top we were standing on a huge rock formation with a big cavity in the middle. The cavity was a natural formation -- creating a shallow fortress-like arrangement on top. This shallow fortress afforded a nearly 360 degree view  while providing numerous quiet routes of escape along adjoining rock formations on the ridge. There were leaves and debris matted down inside the fortress  but there were no indications that humans used this particular spot anytime recently. We were videotaping this rock formation in the dark with the Sony nite-shot and talking as it got darker. I decided to let the two young guys use my night vision goggles and camcorder to have a look around.  At that point I only had a red headlamp with me. While they were looking through the gen-3 and continuing to record video  I stepped up higher on the rock formation to look down over the other side.  When I got up there and looked over the side  my red headlamp lit up a sasquatch standing 15-20 feet away. It standing motionless between two trees  just below the back of the rock formation. I could see it from the waist up  until I turned my headlamp briefly. Then it pulled back into the shadows and slowly walked away. For as many years as I  ve been reading about bigfoots and wondering what an encounter would be like  I would not have predicted my reaction when I finally saw one for the first time that night.  I was completely surprised and shocked.  It was no more than 15-20 feet from me  looking up at me from just below the rock formation. I think no matter how well you prepare yourself  you will be completely surprised and shocked when it finally happens. I was pretty addled at that moment. I started walking backwards away from the edge and nearly fell off the rock formation.  I turned off my headlamp and just stood there for a few seconds. At that point Chuck calmly said  Eyeballs .  I stepped over toward him and asked him where and he said   Over your right shoulder.  At that point I knew there were two animals up there because the eyeshine [glowing eyes] that he was videotaping were in the opposite direction of the one I illuminated only seconds before. I said out loud that there were two up there  but I didn  t tell these young men that I saw one behind us  even closer than the eyeballs in front of us. I didn  t want them to panic because that particular section of the rocky ridge is treacherous. It becomes more treacherous as the fog and dew moisture settle onto the rocks and make them very slippery. Chuck [one of the witnesses] continued videotaping the eyes and reacting to what he was seeing through the camera. One thing that I feel is particularly important to mention at this point.  When I tried to see the eyes I could NOT see them with my own the naked eyes.  But the eyes were not always visible to Chuck  so I may have looked at the wrong moment. A lot of my attention was in the other direction  where I saw one at closer range a moment before. My mind was racing because I knew one of them was behind us. When I looked in front of us I didn  t see the eyes he was talking about  so I was trying to deny it in my mind. We stood there for a period of time  until I finally decided it was time for us to leave. We began heading back down the spine of the ridge the same general direction we had come up. As we walked in the dark I could clearly hear something else walking  following us down the hill. Then I heard other foot falls paralleling us to our left. The three of us were definitely spooked and felt threatened. Dusty had a large spotlight in his backpack and he pulled it out at this point. He lit up our way down the hill. We didn  t see or hear anything else as we returned to camp. When we returned to camp we reviewed the video tape and I was happy to see that we recorded the eyeshine. The facial appearance of the one I saw with my headlight  in no way resembled what I had always imagined.  The eyes reflected the red headlamp. That looked eerie  but the rest of the face was surprisingly gentle looking -- gentle yet intelligent.  It looked surprised but yet unafraid.  The feeling I got was that it was curious but confused  confused as to what we were  and what we were doing up there after dark. There was no pronounced point to its head. It was more of a soft dome shape like a human.  The brow ridge was definitely heavier than a human.  The nose was the most surprising feature of all; it just sort of hung there.  No big flared nostrils or pronounced bridge  just sort of a bulbous lobe.  The mouth was wide  the lips rather humanlike  without the prognathism seen in other primates. ,[Daniel Boone National Forest; not far from Cave Run Lake] ,Rowan,2,Kentucky ,KY,Spring ,21205,yes

1825,The year was 1978 when my family and I took a summer camping trip to the Natural Bridge State Park. The park is located deep in the Daniel Boone National forest  about 52 miles southeast of Lexington  and about 2 miles east of  the town of Slade. I was only 10 years old at the time and was totally oblivious to the word  bigfoot. We drove to the park from the city of Frankfort  the passengers (in 2 separate cars)  included my Mother  step dad  younger sister  Aunt  Uncle  and a family friend.  We arrived at the park a couple of hours before dusk and proceeded to secure a camping lot. After setting up the 2 tents we had brought  everyone became thirsty. Upon searching for the drinks we  d brought along  my uncle discovered that one of the coolers was almost out of ice. It was the month of august and the humidity was very high  so we needed the ice.  I was the one chosen to get ice at the community lodge  about a half of a mile away from our campsite. It was just about dusk when I set out on the muddy road by myself to get the ice. I remember walking from a left to right direction  the road had a steep hill on the left hand side and a small stream paralleled it  s right side  though it was lower than the road and resided in a ravine. About halfway to the lodge  the first thing I can remember was the awful smell. I had smelled dead animals before and figured that  s what was causing the odor. I knew that whatever was responsible for the odor  it  had to be very close  because my eyes were beginning to tear up. It was at that time that I stopped dead in my tracks  because right in front of me was the biggest foot print I  d ever seen. It was so big that there was only one of them  directly in the center of the soft muddy road. It was a bare footprint  complete with the impression of 5 toes. Whoever made this footprint had come down from the steep slope on the left and gone down a shallow embankment on the right and into the stream. I leaned over and began studying the print and it  s enormity. It was nearly as big as I was  or so it seemed at the time. That  s when I remember having this alarming feeling that someone was watching me  I kept studying the print and trying to find a matching print somewhere  but couldn  t. I couldn  t figure how someone could only leave one footprint and why they weren  t wearing shoes. Upon following the path this person must have taken  my eyes made contact with a dark figure from between 50 to 80 yards away from me on the other side of the stream. What I first thought was a tree  suddenly moved. I honestly couldn  t say how tall it was  because it was standing in a ravine and was some distance from me  not to mention that it was starting to get dark  I was only ten years old  and it was 22 years ago. Evidently  it had been standing there for the minute or so  I studied the footprint  and had been watching me. It only moved when It noticed me looking at it  and it very quickly disappeared into the tree line it was standing next to. My visual observation of this creature lasted about 3 seconds at the most. All I can say is that it was covered with dark hair all over. It was kind of shiny  like greasy hair  at least it appeared that way in what light was left. It walked on two legs  and very well I might add  it seemed very graceful. It had long arms that appeared to hang as far down as it  s knees  and they swung as it walked. As far as height  I can say that it was as tall as a few of the smaller trees it stood next to  but I don  t know how tall they were either. While observing the creature  I don  t remember feeling threatened in any way  it was only afterward  when I had time to think about the experience  that I felt afraid.  After observing the creature disappear into the woods  I immediately turned back toward the campsite and ran all the way while yelling for my Step Dad and uncle. They thought that I  d made the whole thing up  that I had concocted the story as an excuse for not wanting to get the ice. Laughing all the way  they offered to escort me to the lodge. Half the way there  they were silenced by the discovery of the footprint  but their silence was only short lived. My uncle was the first to crack a joke   they sure do grown them big around these parts.  They were forced to admit that it was an extremely large footprint  in fact  it easily doubled my step dad  s size 10 1/2 foot.  Since it was now dark  we hurried along to the lodge and back to the campsite with our flashlights. My Uncle convinced me that I had seen a black bear. I had never seen a bear in person before so I didn  t know the difference at the time. I  ve now seen many black bears  in the wild and at zoos  but I have yet to see a black bear walk as swiftly or as gracefully on two legs as the creature I saw that august night of 1978. In fact  I have yet to see a black bear walk on two legs at all  I  ve seen them stand up  but not walk. The arms on the creature I saw were definitely longer than those of any bear. ,From Lexinton  take I-64 east until you reach the Mountain Parkway  from there just follow the signs to Slade.

1826,I have two experiences about 30 years apart at the same location - my parents home in Pike County  Kentucky - that I have always wanted to talk about.  The first occurred around 1966 or 1967.  It was sometime during the winter months  I  m not sure exactly now.  We awoke one morning to a pretty good snow fall  4-6 inches or so.  The unusual part was a huge number of large humanlike tracks behind our house in the snow coming from the hillside to our back yard right up to the house.  I remember my Mom and Dad talking about the tracks and showing them to me and my younger brother and Mom being afraid to let us go out and play in the snow for a long time after that.  We couldn  t understand why or how a person could be out on that hillside in a snowstorm in the middle of the night. The hill is very steep in that area and it  s not easy to climb under the best conditions.  Yet  these tracks led right down the hillside to our house very visible as far as we could see up the hill. The second event occurred in the very same location in the early to mid 90  s.  I was home for a weekend visit in the late summer or early fall.  It was a beautiful  warm evening about 10 30 or 11 00 p.m. and I was outside visiting with my Dad.  I was sitting in a swing beside the porch and Dad was sitting in a chair on the porch.  Suddenly  I stopped the swing because I could hear footsteps coming towards us from way up on the hill.  These sounded like a large human walking down the hill  not like a deer or any other 4 legged animal - very steady paced and coming straight down the hill.  The footsteps continued to get closer and louder until whatever it was got down to the treeline  where it stopped.  I think it either could see us or hear us by then and it stopped at that point. I could hear it shuffle around  for a few seconds  then it turned around and walked back up the hill exactly as it had come down.  I never saw any type of light  such as a flashlight nor heard any voice or other sound that indicated a human presence.  Like I said earlier  this hillside is VERY steep and is difficult to climb under any conditions.  Yet whatever this was climbed straight back up that hillside in the pitch dark without stopping to rest or change directions.  I could hear the same steady bipedal sounding footsteps in the leaves until they went out of earshot.  My dad  about 70 at the time  never heard anything. I grew up there and I don  t know of any human being who could climb that hill in the dark without stopping at all. ,My parents live in Pike County  KY close to the West Virginia border (Tug River). ,Pike,15,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21195,no
1827,I was young about 12 or 13 and I had gone to spend a few weeks with my uncle and cousins  they lived in a secluded area. Only our family lived in this holler and the houses were fairly spread apart. Well my uncle worked night shift in a mine down the road so that left me and me cousins and aunt at home nights alone. It was a clear hot night about 11 30 PM my cousin  and his mom and me were the only ones up and we were watching TV Just about 30 ft from the back door there was a corral with my cousins pony in it. We were watching TV when all of a sudden the pony went absolutely crazy so bad we all jumped up to see what was going on. Just by the way it was carrying on we thought it was a bobcat in there with it (which isn  t unusual to find around there). Me and my cousin both grabbed frog gigs and thought we would just go out and it would run off  feeling real confident we went out and when we rounded the porch and could see we both just about messed our pants. It wasn  t a bobcat. It was big and it was on the other side of he corral headed away like it heard us and was leaving. I swear this to be a true statement. It stepped over a four rail fence as I would one of those things you put in a doorway to keep a child out. All I ever saw of it was it  s back  it never looked around at us. It stepped over the fence and in a mere moment it crossed the dirt road and leaped across the creek and up the side of the hill. After it left the corral and the light wasn  t so good it was by knowing the terrain and the sounds that it made moving  is how I know what it did.I had another cousin who lived around the bend in the direction it went who  s dog disappeared that night. It was chained up and the chain was ripped out of the dog house so if what ever it was took the dog it took chain and all. No way that dog did it and a person wouldn  t have had the brute strength to do that  it was a strong setup. Remember I was 12 or 13 and we didn  t know much about bigfoot or such. But I promise you that thing was 7 to 9 ft tall and as wide as 2 men standing shoulder to shoulder. No sound as heard as far as a scream and no smell was noticed but we sure saw something and it wasn  t a bear  my family was and is raised in the woods and we are all good woodsmen even at that age we had spent all our lives hunting  fishing and exploring those hills and this was something very unique.I thought about someone playing a trick on us but everyone knew that if you did something like that you could easily be shot and I have no doubt that it was a real animal. I didn  t sleep at all that night and I wasn  t really afraid ( I was but I was more curious) it left a feeling that night that I can  t explain. We looked for foot prints or anything the next morning but all we found was where it jumped the creek and dug in to the hillside going up it. Not much more than a big slide of dirt. No one ever said they saw it again and no noises heard. It was really dry and dusty that time of month. I won  t really talk about this much because no body I tell other than my family believes it. But I wasn  t alone when I saw it and I know what I saw. ,It is in the mountains of Eastern KY about 10 miles north of Hazard.

1828,Myself and two buddies were bow hunting a tract of land we had used for quite a few years. This is about a 500 acre patch of hardwoods that borders the Kentucky Turnpike. We always camped in an old abandoned barn right off Nelsonville Rd just a few miles out of Boston. It was a cool November afternoon and we had decided to do some scouting. We had walked a set of railroad tracks about a mile back into the middle of the area we always hunted. We made our way off the tracks and were slowly working thru the woods. The area is mainly gentle rolling hills and bottoms. We were spread out about 100 yards apart and had just topped a small ridge. About 200 yards down in the next bottom something caught my eye. I noticed something black moving quickly through the woods and it was out of site in a matter of seconds. I thought it was pretty odd as there were no bears in this area of the State back then. And we had never noticed any farm dogs or other livestock this far back in the woods. When we met on the tracks to head back to camp I asked my buddies if they had noticed anything strange while scouting and neither of them had seen anything. I casually mentioned what I had seen and left it at that. Later that evening back at the barn  we had finished supper and had turned in to our sleeping bags to call it a night. It was cool and clear and the local farm yard dogs were carrying on pretty good and the katydids were really putting up a fuss. As the area was really loaded with fox and everything seemed to be pretty active I decided to try and call one up from inside the barn. I pulled the cellophane off a pack of smokes and squeezed it between my thumbs and started a series of calls  sounding like a rabbit distress call. This tactic had worked well for us in the past. This evening it worked a little too well. After about 5 minutes of me screaming on the call the local dogs were really worked up good and sounding off like crazy. What happened next  Iâ€™ll never forget till the day they lay me in the ground. From way off in the distance a low moan started up that grew into a load mournful roar that sent shivers down my spine. We all sat up in silence for a few seconds and noticed that not a single dog or katydid was making so much as a peep. The woods had become dead silent. Not believing what weâ€™d just heard I let out one more blast of calls from the makeshift varmit call. Again it started up low and grew into that same roar like sound. This time really put the fear of the Lord in us all. My buddies were begging me to stop and it really didnâ€™t take too much convincing. The hair on the back of my neck and arms was standing straight up and goosebumps had come up all over me. I put the cellophane away and got as deep down in my bag as I could. None of us said another word and sleep was nearly impossible. We all three lay in that barn dead silent till morning light.  Needless to say not a one of us dared head out that next morning in the darkness for any deer hunting. We got up  packed and headed out of there as fast as we could.  I was 17/18 years old at the time and had spent nearly all of this time in the woods and on the water and had never ever heard anything like what we did that night. I am now 48 and have moved off to another State but still spend every possible minute I can in the woods. To this day I have never heard anything like we did that night until I came across your website. When I listened to the 1994 Moaning Howl from Columbiana County Ohio chills ran down my spine. Absolutely 100% no doubt that this was the EXACT same sound we heard coming from the patch of woods that night. My wife and kids think I have lost it when I tell this tale to them and play that recording back over and over to them.  But I can say with certainty that what I heard some 30 odd years ago in that old barn is a perfect match to the Ohio recording. . ,Highway 61 ends into Boston Road..Take a left on Boston Road  down about 1/4 mile take a left on Nelsonville Rd.

1829,Transcribed from a telephone message left on  BFRO.NET Hello  my name is xxxxx saw BF two years ago  my father encountered him about  10 years ago. I live in South Central Kentucky  we are about an hour from the Tennesse line and about 45 minutes east of I65 in Metcalfe County Kentucky.   Anyway  Iâ€™ve come face to face with him at 20 yards .  He turned left I saw the white around his face. He was 8 foot tall or better. I heard him make three steps  and I saw him walk up the street. I live about three miles out of town.   Anyway  I come in tonight and when I got out of my car I  heard  the awfullest scream I heard in my life.  Sounds a lot like what you guys sound like when you are on TVâ€¦ And immediately  it there were  like about 15 dogs going crazy barking doing their worst after this thing squealed and squalled like it did.    Theres a family or two here  thatâ€™s lives in a real desolate area  seeing or encountering a bigfoot or sasquatch whatever you want to call it.

1830,We have three episodes at the same location. Four years ago in mid September 2007  we decided to camp on our property which is located in Doe Valley Community.  The community is very special...it is nestled against Fort Knox Reservation and large forested areas.  Doe Valley is a nature reserve where deer  turkey  foxes and numerous other indigenous animals are so tame they will come up to be hand fed.  There is a no hunting restriction on the area which is riddled with caves and creeks.  In fact  the creek which backs up to our property was named by Squire Boone and hunted by the Boone family.  Several abandoned mills here were even built by Abraham Lincoln  s father...so the area is very steeped in natural and American history. As we began camping this evening  we noticed that several rocks were rolling on the ground at different points in our night.  I was concerned someone was in the woods throwing stones  but our community is very rural and this would have been something very rare. We had also been hearing what appeared to be a loud howling...a mix between a female screaming and a wolf howl.  Not a fox yelp as we are used to hearing those...but much deeper and louder. The hour grew late  and my children got sleepy...so they decided to retire into the tent.  My one son insisted on using his own dome camping tent and though I am unsure why I was so leary...being in such a safe location.  But  I told him that if he wanted to sleep in his own tent he would have to place it in direct view of our family tent  s window so I could keep an eye on him. I went into my own tent after puting the fire out and lay down just to keep warm while I waited for dawn...the time was about 3 a.m. Then suddenly a sound came from outside of the tent in the woods...a sound of cracking and very heavy footsteps through grass. It went WHOOOSH thump WHOOOSH thump WHOOOOSH THUMP and I began to chuckle thinking...here the children waited up to see deer  or raccoons...and they come when we go to bed.  But then the thing walks up to my tent and begans to walk past.  But then I realize...wait...this is walking on only TWO FEET.  I begin to smell the odor of a wet dog mixed with a skunk...or like an elephant pen at the zoo.  Suddenly it BUMPS my tent over and over again as it makes its way past my tent in a direct approach to my son  s tent and suddenly my son  s ENTIRE f***ing tent came off the ground and is shaken in the air like it was nothing.  It was just shaking it up and down and Cody is screaming NO STOP>>>TURK!!! That is my older son who was 15 at the time.  He was sick and went in to bed because he has a condition which causes muscles to contract when he uses them.  Knowing this thing could not possibly be my son...as the tent is several feet off the ground and something VERY large I know is there because I heard it approach out of these acres of wooods I shout  CODY IT  S NOT TURK!!!MY GOD!!  and the thing immeditately throws the tent down and begins to run extremely fast back against my tent which again begins to BUMP BUMP BUMP!  against the side...and then I hear it going back into the woods with the same WHOOSH Thump sound and then the sounds of cracking branches. My son immediately ran to my tent  where we called my husband who was on his way home from his night shift job. Flash forward to this year  mid September 2011...and my son and daughter were outside of our home...and a stench began overcoming them in our two car garage which had both doors fully opened up.  My son came out to find out what was making this horrible odor.  There  in the middle of our yard  not ten feet from where the tent had been four years ago..was an enormous creature  dark fur and hug eyes lit by our porch. My other son comes to me and tells me that this is exactly the same discription of the creature he and his friend came across at our creek.  It was bent over at the edge of the creek and when they came closer...it jumped up on two feet and walked quickly into the woods. .... Now  about fifty years ago...my mother and her mother wound up in the newspaper in Madisonville Ky for a monster which nearly took the door to their rural home off one night.  She saw the monster howling and grunting at the window.  It left marks upon the tree outside their home and the sheriff made a report.  I refused to let my mother tell this story to my children...despite her swearing that it was not a bear.  I am the sort of person who likes to see things before I will believe it...and I thought it a foolish story. But  I am here to tell you...something is migrating through Doe Valley each year...and it is not something I have ever seen in the animal world before.  The natural gentle and plentiful climate here with caves and plenty of unexplored forests...I feel is its perfect home. Now  I am a believer. , ,Meade,2,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21163,yes
1831,This occurred in July 2006. I was on my way to work  it was approx  4 30 AM in the morning. I was riding my motorcycle. I have a extra bright headlight on my motorcycle and I approached an area with a saw mill  I notice something squating beside the road. I slowed and passed this thing and was no more than 4 feet away. I looked right into its eyes and face. The hair was about 2.5 to 3 inches long  black and shiny. I know it was not any animal I had ever seen before. No Bear No Dog nothing. The height if this thing had it stood up would be at least 6.5 feet tall. I continue to ask myself did I just see what I thought I saw. I was to shook up to stop and double check of what I saw. I still to this day wish I had stopped and verified what I saw. Anyhow I still look for it whenever I am night riding. ,about midway between calhoun  Ky and Beech Grove  Ky. On HWY 136  3 miles SE of Beech Grove ,McLean,2,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21149,yes
1832,As I approached a wooded area near the McCreary County-Whitley County line. I saw something move in the distance on the side of the road. Thinking it might be Deer that would dart out in front of me  I slowed down a bit. As I got closer I was astonished to see that whatever it was  was about 7 feet tall with Gray hair that covered the entire body. It turned toward me and it  s eyes were large and seemed to be a reddish color. The thing ranted around like it was angry or something and I floored the vehicle. I was scared to death and I immediately drove to my cousin  s house to calm down and tell him what had happened. I  ve traveled that road alot and never saw anything like that. I had a clear shot of the thing and was fairly close. I  m not one to usually believe these stories but this IS what I saw. ,Highway 92 ,McCreary,2,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21147,yes
1833,Subject  Large White   Ape-like  Creature Reported Date  October 7  1980 @ 9 30 PM Witness  C.F. Location  Mayslick  Kentucky (Mason County) Investigators  Ron Schaffner and Earl Jones -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Case Data  C.F. and his family were watching television when they heard a loud noise on the front porch. C.F. said he heard his son  s pet rooster disturbed. When he peered out the front door  he saw a white  hairy creature with pink eyes that must have weighed about 400 pounds and was about 7 feet tall. The creature was holding the rooster by the neck and then threw it against the side of the house. It then proceeded around the back of the house in a vacant lot. C.F. claimed to have grabbed his .22 pistol and followed the intruder. He fired on the creature twice  as it ran out of sight. Our investigation began shortly after hearing of the incident through a small article in the Cincinnati Enquirer. We contacted a Maysville  Kentucky newspaper  who in turn told us of a local radio newsman doing his own work into the matter. Doug McGill of WFTM  Maysville was kind enough to give us C.F.  s phone number. We called him and arranged an interview on Sunday  October 12. C.F.  believes that the lights coming from his porch and living room may have frightened the creature and that is why it seemed to go on a rampage. C.F.  said that its white hair was real long - much like a horse  s mane. He also stated that the creature was  man-like   except that those eyes were like that of an animal. C.F. described other interesting facts. He described the creature  s gait as having large strides  but it appeared as moving at a slow speed  as if he (C.F.) could catch up with it. but the faster C.F.ran at it  the further distance between them. He said it almost like a dream - the kind of dream that when a wild animal is chasing you and you cannot seem to run away. There was a clothes line that stretches from a tree to the back porch. He did not know why the creature evaded the line  but he remembers that he almost hung himself because it was so dark. Conclusions  Close scrutiny of the family pet rooster revealed no signs of physical harm or injuries. It would be difficult to believe that this animal could withstand the force of being projected against the house by a creature of the reported size. C.F.  also told us that another pet - a raccoon was found on the roof later that night and no one knew how it got there. It had been in a closed cage earlier that day. The clothes line may have been a depth perception  or night blindness on C.F.  s part. He probably just forgot about it being there. We spent several hours backpacking the surrounding area and could not find any trace evidence  such as footprints  droppings  or hair. There wasn  t any recent rain  so the terrain was quite hard. The last instant the creature was observed  it was headed up the gravel road that lies to the west of C.F.  s house. Other members of the family told us about a car with some teenagers that may have seen it. They told us that when their father chased the unknown around the house  this car stopped for a few seconds and then spun away at a high rate of speed  leaving tire marks a good distance up the road. These marks were still visible on our visit. Attempts to track down this car were fruitless. While there is no physical evidence  we are still left with the testimony of Mr. C.F. . His credibility - in our opinion- lends credence to the story. It should be remembered that it was the press - not him that began using the term bigfoot. We can neither prove  nor disprove his story; therefore the case is still listed as an unknown. , ,Mason,29,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21161,yes
1834,When I saw this creature  I was told not to tell anybody or they would think I was crazy!! In 1950 when I was 12 years old   I lived in a little hamlet called Beauty located in eastern Kentucky  located along the border of the Tug River. We children played in the mountains almost all summer long.  We had heard of a rock cliff back up on the hill that had a cave in it and we decided to go looking for this cliff with the cave.   Being kids  we didn  t keep track of how far we climbed or what ridges we went on  but finally we reached this cliff.  We were standing at the base looking up through the shadows of the trees when I noticed there was someone standing up on the rock (about 10 feet up)  looking back at us. He was  I judge about 6 feet tall.   Muscular.  His arms were longer than a humans.His legs about like a human. He had hair much like a chimps hair grows on its arms and legs. NOT the fuzzy hair like a bear.  His chest seemed to be pretty hairless.   Very hairy around the genital area so one could not tell if he was male or female....but I didn  t see any breasts so I judged it to be male.    He was holding a heavy stick in his hand as he stood there looking down at us.   I could not see his facial features.    I would say that he was an intelligent being from the way he behaved. He stood looking at us for about 15 seconds then he stepped back out of our sight and was gone.   It was not until I was an adult that I realized what I had seen. I believe this being knew we were children....I believe he allowed us to see him because we did not present him any danger.   Of course we yelled and tore up the bushes running back off that hill!!   I told my grandma that we had seen a gorilla and she told me people would think I was crazy.   So I kept it to myself what I had seen. ,Far back in the mountains in eastern Kentucky.

1835,(Please excuse the old story  was not aware a site like this exsisted to record information  also  haven  t told too many people...guess you can just imagine why...) April  1990  rural Marshall County  I was attempting to make a residential delivery.  While walking up the gravel drive I noticed a flock of birds flying overhead coming from the direction of a thick grouping of trees in the back of a field to my left.  They were chattering loudly and flying wildly in what seemed to be a race.  As they got closer I noticed that there were different speices flying together...Blue Jays  Caridnals  Black Birds  Finches  etc...This struck me as odd for a moment.  When I reached the steps to the porch of the home I heard the thunder of hooves hitting the ground and turned and saw many horses that were in the field come running from the edge of the forest towards the house  they too where whinnying and making alot of commotion.  Before I could really think anything about it  I saw several deer leeping from the thick trees and running thru the fields away from the same spot  and behind the horses.  My first thought then was that there was a fire!  I hurried to the residence door and knocked very hard and repeatedly  while scanning the sky for any signs of smoke.  No one answered.  Having delivered here before I thought the occupant might be around back in the barn so I left the porch and turned to walk in that direction  that  s when I heard the most terrifying sound in my entire life that I knew could not have been human or from any known animal in this area. The sound came from the thick group of trees and echoed over the fields in thick vibrations.  It was a mixture of a deep lions growl that hightened into a scream containing the same low  deep  loud rhythym.  I stood stunned  half scarred and half curious.  From the area of the trees where the sound traveled from was the figure of something very tall  very large in width and very strong  as some of the smaller pine trees about 10 to 15 feet in height were being shaken back and forth vigorously and violently.  The figure itself was not totally visible but hidden mostly behind the shadows of the larger trees behind and around it.  It was dark in color  guessing dark brown or black  with a thick furry outline.  It looked to have stood well over 7 feet in height. It began moving along the edge of the trees towards the house  just keeping inside the safety of the shadows.  The horses in the pasture where on the far right hand side now  rising up and hitting the fence with their hooves.  This was too much excitement for me  and I turned to run to my truck.  That hideous sound came thru the air again  but this time it was much closer than before   I quickly made it into the truck  started the engine and left very rapidly.(Half way expecting the engine to be flooded or the battery dead  like in some lame horror movie.) This event left me pretty shaken  but it was also my duty as a courier to return to the home the next day to reattempt the delivery.  Upon reaching said home  I briefly explained to the occupant what occured the day before  expecting him to start laughing.  To my surprize  he only agreed that there had been some strange sounds coming from   those neck of the woods   lately  and that his horses were frequently   spooked   by something in the area.  He also stated that a friend of his had took his hunting dog back there a few weeks prior to this incident and that the dog took out after something  disappeared from sight  let out  curdling yelping sounds  then went quiet.  He said his buddy found what was left of the dog  it  s head was not to be found  and that there had been a fowl ordor around the area at the time.  He further insisted it was probably a   bobcat   or something and never suggested anything else  except not to   go in them there woods   by myself. Not to worry  I had no intentions of it. ,Go west of Benton  Ky on Mayfield Hwy  also called Hwy 58  about 2 miles from the new 4 lane Hwy 641  turn right on Houser Rd  go another mile and turn left on Cole Cemetery Rd.

1836,my grandfather told me about seeing a thing he said looked like a ape when he was was hunting at harvest in Magoffin county when he was younger. said he didnt shoot it because he didnt know what it was. im writing this because he dont know how to use a computer. also told me his grandfather called them hairy men. , ,Magoffin,1,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21153,yes
1837,It was about 1972 or   73 in Berea  KY.and I must have been 15 or so. My brother  a friend of mine  and I were sleeping out in our  tent  made of plastic tossed over one of those umbrella type clothes lines. The plan was to sneak out later to walk up town to meet with our girlfriends. It was probably about 2 a.m. when I came out of the tent.  Our house was built into a hillside and over looked the college owned cornfield and out across the county which at that time was not very developed. I was standing with my back to the field looking up the hill at the stars while waiting for the others to get up. I got impatient and had turned around toward the tent to tell them to hurry when I saw what I first thought was my neighbor standing at the corner of the house next to the pine tree that grew there. Problem was this thing looked to be about 7 or 8 feet tall  as it  s head was into the branches. My mind was racing trying to grasp/rationalize what I was seeing. Why was my neighbor wearing white? How did he know we were out here tonight?  Why was he standing so still and how the hell did he get so tall?  We  meaning  it  and I  stared at each other for several seconds.  Then the thing turned and pushed off against the tree and bolted down over the bank and into the woods toward the corn field.  I was impressed with the speed  the lack of noise it made while running and the fact that the tree which was pretty big actually swayed when it pushed off from it.  About that time my friend came out of the tent and I told him about what I had just saw. I don  t remember if he acted like he believed me or not. My brother was more inclined to believe my story because he and my sister had often heard what we called  the cruncher  while sleeping out on the screened in backporch (which is about 15 feet off the ground on the back of the house). You see   back before we had air conditioning we three kids would sleep on the porch during the summer to get the cooler night air. We had a small mutt dog that would sleep with us. Many times we would be waked up the sound of our young imaginations sounded like an animal munching on animal bones. We were scared too death but would look over the edge trying to see what ever it was. We never did see anything because the woods were so thick and we were so far up. We knew we weren  t crazy because the dog would sit there stock still and give one of those low throaty growls that would make a person freeze if you heard it in the dark. We tried a couple times to get the dog to go outside and (we were hoping) chase the thing.  We never saw a dog resist so hard. She acted like we were trying to shove her into a fire or something.  After that dog died we got another that reacted the very same way and was only about half as smart as the little mut dog. Anyway  my dad had flood lights installed which only succeeded in lighting up the wall of trees and vegetation. Back to the sighting   I can  t recall a lot of detail  I  ve often wanted to try being hypnotised to see if I could recall more. What I remember is the thing was covered with off white to tan colored hair with less on it  s face and stomach area. I don  t recall facial details at all which frustrates and frightens me at the same time. I also don  t recall any smell which is not unusual.  I seem to have inherited my mothers   poor sense of smell. The arms were longer than a humans and the strength was demonstrated when it shoved the tree. This is the only experience in my life that I can not explain rationally. My brother and sister can verify  the cruncher . We also built a playhousein the back yard which we only slept in one time and that was on Halloween with several other kids! We once went into the corn field and picked so much corn that we had to leave it piled up in the thicket with the idea to get the rest the next day.  Problem was the next morning it was gone  every last ear. Way too much for a raccoon or even a family of racoons to have hauled off. I should add that this was what we called  field corn  which became rock hard when ripe and was used to feed cows and pigs. If you caught it at the right time it was pretty good to eat  otherwise it would crack your teeth. It finaly hit me a few years later that  the crucher   was probably eating the field corn and not munching on bones. After a while  the area started to get built up and we heard less and less of the noise. There was an article in the local paper about the time all this was happening about a family that lived further out  but not that far from us  that was some unusual stuff happening around their home. They were finding what they thought were big nests of leaves around their property and had caught glimpses of something on occasion passing their windows. I still have the article somewhere. It was in the local paper  The Berea Citizen .  I wanted to contact the family but never did  I was afraid of being called a nut (small town). I  ve only told a few people of this. It still raises the hair on the back of my neck to tell it and  as I just discovered  to write it down. Like I said this is the only event of my life that is unexplained. ,Near Berea  Kentucky ,Madison,38,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21151,yes
1838,I had just climbed down from my deer hunting stand and quietly walked to the edge of a large soybean field. The moon was full and I thought perhaps I would see deer running from the field. What I saw was still creates goose bumps on my arms. Standing 30 feet from me and approximately 20 feet from the woods was an extremely large creature. It was between 7 and 8 feet tall and could have weighed as much as 500 pounds. It had a very short neck and arms that reached nearly to the knees. It made no movement toward me. The face was not visible due to the time of day. I was loaded down with compound bow and portable deer stand. I cannot detail the fear I experienced getting back to my jeep. I didn  t shine the flashlight at it  as I was too frightened. The next day I went back armed with a 300 Weatherby to look for signs  but the ground was to hard to see tracks. There were no bushes in the field. There was no mistake in what I saw. ,Logan County  Kentucky. 6 miles west of Russellville. 1 mile north of Highway 178 ,Logan,13,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21141,yes
1839,(night before) me and my boyfriend went riding around out near the farm its just a old country road. i got to thinking and ask him if we locked the gate back at the farm  we went earlier to feed the cattle. he paused for a few seconds and looked at me and said i dont know  since we are close to the farm pull up at the neighbors new house and park in their drive way and ill run and check the gate. the gate isnt but a few feet away from the neighbors house. this house was still getting finished they had a big pile of gravel in the drive way were they werent done. i had my lights off in the drive way i looked back at him and i had the window cracked bout a inch this weird smell came through the window. then like a growl or grunt noise came from the front of the car. i turned on the lights i seen this big thing standing behind the gravel pile with one hand proped up on it and leaning over it with its big eyes and it had really long blackish brown hair. i started to hollar for my boyfriend and told him to get in the car. he asked me whats wrong what is it? i never freak it takes alot to scare me like that and he knows it. i notice him looking over to the right of the gravel pile and asked if i heard the noise. i told him what i saw and he asked if i was sure and i told him yes. i asked if we could go and get down the road and to leave it alone. we got bout 2 miles down the road and he turned and looked at me and said i saw something big running down toward the road  are you sure it wasnt teenagers out here. i told him i know what i saw and i want to head home. we went home the next day he had to help his step dad at the farm. (next day) we went to his moms house to meet up i stayed behind with her and told her what i saw. as the hours passed by we started worring bout them we called and text but no reply. bout 9 they walked throught the door  and they had a look that is hard to describe and my boyfriend looked at me and his mom and said u wont believe what we found and i have pictures. he opened his phone up and there was a perfect pic of a huge footprint and he said it was fresh they were out in the feild and heard a big crashing noise down the hill from them and they went to go see what it was and they found the prints and u can see in the others that it slid down the hill or it lost its footing. his mom looked at me and said so its real. and i said yeah. ,on old fall lick rd turn onto harmons lick i think thats what the farm road is called im not sure.

1840,I came home about 9 00 PM. My father and I got out of my vehicle and immediately heard a loud screeching roar that reverberated off the surrounding hills. We stood in my drive and tried to tell where it was coming from. We heard the roar again about 10 or 15 seconds later and I determined it was coming from the northern part of my property. My father and I went quickly into the house and I grabbed my shotgun and loaded it with 00Buck. My father refused to accompany me to the woods as he was scared. I grabbed my flashlight and headed out the door and up the hill. I left the light off and walked as quietly and slowly as I could. As I neared the woods  there was a strong  foul odor. I heard branches breaking in the woods and flicked on my flashlight  pointing it towards the sounds. When the light went on  IT  took off on two legs and busted branches as it went. I only had a short glimpse of it but  it was tall  large  hairy  and an animal of some sort. I mentioned it to an old farmer friend the next day and he told me it had been spotted years ago and was called the  Critter   by the locals. I haven  t had any other contacts since that fateful day. I might mention that I checked the woods out the next day and there were numerous broken branches up to a height of about 8 foot  and the ground showed obvious disturbance from its fleeing ,Lewisburg  Kentucky  Logan County.

1842,On June  18  2014 I set out to find where two creeks merge back in the woods. On the left of a old wagon road i noticed a 17 inch footprint at the edge of the road/path. A few feet farther another 7.5 inch footprint next too a tree about 3 feet high on the bank overlooking where the creeks merge. Left my casting material in the truck; therefore  decided to walk back after taking pics.  Sunday afternoon the 22nd and after a few days of rains went back a different way. While walking next to the woods in a corn field i heard something trailing me in the woods. Determined it was somewhat large with all the noise it was making breaking  branches and logs on the ground. Went past the location where the creeks merge and doubled back. Walked towards the creeks and noticed a footprint in the field. The toes section was gone but the other 2/3rd of the foot was still there. A small print was on the back right side of the adults heal print about 2.5 to 3 inches long. Placed my backpack next to the print because no others around. The farmer had cultivated the field. Walked to the creeks and chased something into the creek. It was large by the sound of the splash  like a belly busted splash sound. It ran off and started making growls. It would do a growl  then a second later do another growl. Then a few seconds 5 to 10 seconds of silence then another set of two growls. Did this for eight sets of growls and then i did a whoop  after that whoop... silence - not another sound. Spent days looking for growls like what i heard and on Legends Beware a video taken on 12/July/2013 at the counter mark of .18 and especially 1.40 is the growl. I have been back and left peanut butter but no other tracks except a lot of deer tracks.

1843,It was opening day of modern gun deer season in Logan County Kentucky  Nov. 14  2015.  My husband  took me to my deer stand at the edge of the hay field.  There was no moon  and I couldn  t see much of anything in front of me. I waited until he left in the old Jeep and continued to wait for approximately 10-15 min before I turned on the red bill light on my cap to load my gun.  I loaded three shells into my 243 then turned off my bill light. Within a minute I hear a rustle on the ground to my left and slowly turned my head in the direction of the sound.  I saw two red lights  like eyes approximately 30ft away and I judged the red lights to be 8-10 feet off the ground.  I thought for a second that I was seeing spots before my eyes from my red bill light.  I rubbed my eyes and blinked a couple of times  thinking I needed to clear my eyes.  The lights were steady for a few seconds then blinked twice  like I had done.  I was wondering what was going on  thinking another hunter had walked up to my stand  then I heard loud movement in the leaves as if it was moving up to the old road approximately 50 yds away. I could not make out a shape but as it neared what I considered close to the  old road  it stopped and started a low whoo sound that increased to a very loud whoop.  I was scared then  I have hunted for many years and I have never heard an animal make that sound. I clicked the safety off my gun but by that time I could hear it making it  s way along the old road ridge heading toward our cattle barn. ,on our family farm off Gasper River Road ,Logan,13,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21141,yes
1844,This incident occurred in the later part of 1983 (September I believe) just outside of Richmond Kentucky in Waco. I was about 12 years old and was out riding my bike when I decided to go visit a friend. He lived about a 1/4 mile off the main highway at the end of a gravel road. His house was the only one on the road and was completely surrounded by thick woods. After arriving  I walked to the door and realized nobody was home. As I returned to my bike I heard a loud crash from the side of the house  I quickly looked ad saw a large black figure tearing a huge limb from a tree. The figure was at least 7-8 feet tall and covered in thick black hair  couldn  t guess the weight  but it was big. The figure was standing upright and was looking right at me  it was no bear. I quickly jumped on my bike and peddled like hell toward the main road. The ride back to the main road seemed to take forever and the entire distance back I could hear branches breaking and what appeared to be heavy footsteps running along side me; I was terrified. I thought for sure I was about to be attacked  then I hit the main road and it stopped. I kept riding  but couldn  t help but wonder why whatever it was stopped chasing me once I hit the road. I don  t know what it was  but I do know if it were a bear it wouldn  t have stopped  and it was fast because it was able to catch a terrified kid peddling his butt off. I had another encounter  this time with witnesses  in the same area when I was 19  but that  s another story ,The location was just off Flint Rd. in Waco  Ky. My second encounter was also in Waco. ,Madison,38,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21151,yes
1845,It was in July  93. I was hiking up on Bear Mt. near my families home in Eastern Ky. I had my pair of binoculars I had just bought and wanted to try them out on a high view. As I rounded the cliff  I was looking down this hollow that leads into a briar thicket. I had been hearing this odd  tapping  noise all the while  and saw this dark brownish figure near a log close to the thicket some 250 yards away (I have a hard time determining distance  so it could more or less) At first I thought it a rare sighting of a black bear  but when I looked at it through the bin  s  I couldn  t believe what I saw. It was sitting on a log with it  s back to me  with a rock in its hand beating on this logs side. It had a back that was at least 2.5 feet across and covered in short  thick reddish brown hair. It looked like a giant hair covered man with no neck. With the bins I could see in good detail  so there was no mistake. The hands looked human  four fingers and a thumb  the skin a dark greyish color. The head was conical  like a lowland gorilla. Suddenly this thing must have smelled or sensed me  because it stood up and looked in my direction. It had a bulged forehead near the eyebrow  large round dark eyes  and a flared gorilla like nose. The jaw was slightly long to the chest  but did not protrude at the mouth. the nose and eyes areas was free of hair  the skin a dark grey. but from the nose  mouth  and chin were covered in hair. (Sort of like a hairy ninja hood). The creature was HUGE! I later looked at a tree it was standing near and it had to be near 7ft tall. It stared up the mountain at me  and made a peculiar motion with its head  waving it from side to side  and seemed to hunch over a bit with its arms dangling at it  s knees. It then turned and dashed off threw the thicket. I never saw it again. Needless to say  I got the hell out of there. , ,Madison,38,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21151,yes
1846,This was around the end of September 2014  I recently made friends with the guy I purchased my four wheeler from.  He called me to see if I would be interested in riding on his friends property on four wheelers  I told him yes and showed up. We arrived at his friends farm with 3 four wheelers plus his friends quad which made 4 quads total  time was 21 00 eastern time. There were 5 of us that went riding 4 males one female which was my friends girlfriend. After riding for an hour on this guys farm we went to this place they call *******  its south of Berea off of US25.  Its easily a few thousand acres of undeveloped land.  We ride with no incident for an hour or so  around 2230 at night we decide to head back to the farm we left earlier in the night.  As we were heading out we stopped so everyone could catch up because some had utility quads and some had racing quads  as we waited was when the first incident took place  as we sat we heard a branch snap like it was being deliberately snapped to let us know we were not alone  it was about 50 yards to our left in thick brush  we sat there quiet and just waited to see what would happen next  I have hunted deer before and it did not sound like large game traveling thru brush  it was a single snap  no brush or leaves moving like when a animal walks  also you heard no noise at all  dead silent  insects stopped making noises  you could hear a needle drop. We decided at this point to move on  it was a strange incident but not alarming yet...  We rode up the trail about a quarter mile to half mile and stopped at a clearing in the woods to just talk  we were all present  we spoke abit about that branch and just other general things when out of no where a large  extremely large log was hurled from up the hill next to my friends four wheeler at the base of the hill  the log was a good sized log  I stood up and looked up the hill but as soon as I did this massive lime stone slab was hurled toward the same friends four wheeler and barely missed him  at this point you heard loud thumps and branches breaking like something was running down the hill with alot of weight  at this point everyone started their four wheelers and we sped out of there.  We haven  t gone back since.  I am not a believer  I thought sightings were hoaxes before that night but now I cant explain what that was and I  m not ruling out the possibility that it could have been bigfoot. , ,Madison,38,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21151,yes
1847,Subject  Tall  white haired  ape-like  creature Date  November 5  1980 @ 4 00 or 5 00 AM Witness  N. C. Location  Mason County  Kentucky - west of Maysville on U.S. 68 Investigators  Doug McGill (WFTM radio) and Dave Jones (Maysville police detective) Case Data  This incident is on file with the Maysville  Kentucky police department. We consider it to be valid. We cannot comment any conclusions because no researcher interviewed the witness. Mr. N.C.  an Alabama truck driver was hauling steel west on U.S. Route 68 when he saw a figure on the opposite side of the highway. He slowed his vehicle and turned on his high beams thinking that it was a hitch hiker. When he approached the figure  he was shocked to see a 6-7 foot tall  ape-like  creature with white hair. After his encounter  he contacted some locals on C.B. channel 22 to see if there was a zoo or circus in the area. He thought that possibly an ape had escaped. When police were called to investigate  they took N.C.  s statement and filed a report. He stated to police that he had never been to this area before and knew nothing about alleged Bigfoot reports. (N.C.)had heard about previous reports from other C.B  ers. The police believe that Clay was serious on what he reported. ,Mason County  Kentucky - west of Maysville on U.S. 68 ,Mason,29,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21161,yes
1848,My brothers and I were swimming in the creek across from my Mom and Dad  s house when I was 11 or 12 years old. I am 40 now and I can still see it very vividly in my mind  s eye. I had left my watch at the  Deep Part   which is what we call the part of the creek we swam in. I had tried to get one of my brothers to go back with me and get my watch. Neither of them would go with me. I tried for about anther half hour or so to get them to go with me to get my watch none of them would go. So it was about 4 30 to 5 00 in the afternoon when I finally got the nerve to go get my watch. The bottom that lead down to the  Deep Part  is approxiamtely 100 to 125 yards long to the fenceline to the waterjole where we were swimming. I got to in front of the neighbor  s which a little more than half to where the  deep Part  is at the fenceline. When I got to just infront of or just a little past their house  I saw a tall black figure  walking upright  walk along that fenceline. I saw it take 3 steps then my hair stood on end and I ran back to our house. I told my family and they said that I saw a deer. I am telling you guys this was no deer I saw it take 3 step  it was tall and it was dark colored. If I had to guess it was 7.5 to 8 feet tall and its stride was 6 to 7 feet long. Its elbow was right to the top of its hips but the hand didn  t quite reach the knee. , ,Mason,29,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21161,yes

1850,It was in July 2006.  Not sure what day.  About 9 30PM.  I was walking from my garage to the house when I heard a terrible screaming in the holler at the back of our property.  I heard it again about 30 seconds later.  I have heard coyotes several times but this sound was like nothing I  ve ever heard.  It sent chills down my spine.  I mentioned it to my son a few days ago and he said  you  ve heard that too?   I asked him when he heard it and he said about 3 weeks ago.  He too was walking from the garage to the house around 9 30 or 10 at night and heard a terrible screaming from the same location.  He  s a very skepticle person and never thought to mention it until I did.  I remember being at the back of my property in this location in the winter of 1989 burning some brush.  I sat down and then heard a loud grunting sound about 20 feet behind me.  I thought it was probably a buck but I never saw anything and nothing ran away like a deer would have.  Also in the summer of 1988 my wife and I went to the back of the property at night just to do a little exploring.  We had just moved there and were curious what it would look like at night.  We heard something moving in the cedar trees.  It spooked us and we went back to the house.  What ever it was followed us parallel on the path in the cedars.  We never actually saw what it was. ,[Location details removed from submission at the request of the witness.] ,Nelson,2,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21179,no
1851,A friend and I were walking up the hill at approximately 2 00 am.No drugs or alcohol had been consumed by either of us.  We were walking on the road up the hill when we both heard a  scream   for the lack of a better word.  It definitely was NOT human  but it sounded like no animal I had ever heard.  It was simultaneously high-pitched and growling; it was very strange.  It first seemed to originate from a pretty good distance away.  This is mountainous country  and we were near to the crest of the hill.  the sound seemed to come from the valley below.  When we first heard it  we both froze and looked at each other.  After the  scream  ended  we both asked   What the hell was that!!   and we started to move a little faster up the hill.  After 20-30 seconds  we heard the sound a second time  only now it lasted longer (about 6-7 seconds) and sounded MUCH closer.  At this point we ran up the hill and back to my friend  s home as fast as we could.  My friend  who still lives  in the area  says that he has heard the sound on two other occasions since then  but I never heard anything like it again;  that is  until  I downloaded some possible Bigfoot sounds recorded in Ohio  and that is EXACTLY the sound we heard that night.  And a WAV file is as close to that sound as I care to get again. ,Coal Harbor Hill  Perry County  Kentucky  USA ,Perry,12,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21193,no
1852,In the early 90  s growing up in eastern ky my step-brother and I used to adventure into the hills behind my house on an almost weekly basis  we came across many strange and eerie places in these hills but on this particular winter mid-morning I remember very vividly we were wanting to top the hill which is a very long hike or it was as early teens. Anyway I remember we came along a level area about midway maybe a little more and there was snow on the ground. We came across footprints very large but they stopped after a short distance. These footprints were not those of shoes  just feet. I remember getting scared and we returned home.

1854,We were racoon hunting we had turned our dogs out and let them get a head start on us...we gave them a half-hour or so to let them get far enough ahead of us..we then got in the truck and started out the road  you can only drive about 10 miles in a truck untill the road becomes too narrow to pass  we got to where we had to turn the truck. (there were 8 of us in the truck 3 in the cab and 5 in the bed)  We called the dogs but got no response  so we waited...about 30 to 45 mins later the dogs came running back to the truck with their tails tucked between their legs like sometings had scared them to death. Now we didn  t think anything about this  passing it off as a bobcat that had spooked the dogs..we loaded the dogs into the truck and started back out of the mountain.  We had only made it about 100 to 200 feet when the driver of the truck slammed on the brakes ( we weren  t going fast ) I was in the back of the truck not knowing what was going on..I looked into the back glass and saw the 3 in the front of the truck pointing up ahead of us so we ( the people in the back ) stood up and looked  what we saw was huge  standing about 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall  the color was hard to tell with the shadows but I would say it was either black or dark brown.  After about ten seconds the driver put the truck in reverse and backed up 50 feet or so..we all got out of truck and asked one another if we had all saw it..we all did  but we werent sure what we had saw  some said a bear  some said   bigfoot  .  after about 10 mins. of talking about it we got back into the truck and drove back to where it had stood.  We got out of the truck and walked up to where we had saw it. There was a hole of water in each side of the road but in the center was mud and in the mud was a very large footprint  not a bear track  it looked like a huge human footprint about 15 to 16 inches long. it had a very large big toe and only three small toes.  We looked in awe at this track until we heard sticks breaking  this scared us..so we jumped in the truck and flew away...we stopped a few miles away..we had a flat tire  while changing the tire we all wanted to go back and see if we could see this thing again....So after we changed the tire we headed back...we stopped the truck right before the place we saw the footprint..we got out and looked and you could barely see it.. when we drove through it we had destroyed it..but this told us something..what we had saw had made the footprint  the print was fresh when we had saw it the first time..if it wasn  t we would have destroyed it the very first time we went by the spot....We have went back a number of times trying to see this thing again with no luck...maybe someday.... By the way  Great web site... I would like to say that I would have never thought that I would see something like this  if it was a  Bigfoot  or not..I know that it wasn  t a bear and it wasn  t anything that modern science knows about... I would never have gave any thought to a story like this being true  but after seeing something first hand that I have no answer for I beleive that there ,Near Virgie Kentucky  nearest road is 1469   on an old auger mining road less than 10 miles North east of the Jefferson National Forest ,Pike,15,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21195,yes
1855,In April of 2005 i was in a doctors office in pike co. ky. i was looking out the window and seen a tall creature on a rock cliff accross from the jail   at the mouth of chloe creek. It was acting very confused or anxious. It walked slumped over and made three different trips from the edge of the cliff back to the tree line. The creature was brown in color. It was at a distance that i saw the creature. It seemed to be thin and tall. The lady in the doctors office seen it too. We attemped to point it out to other people in the office but it had disapeared into the treeline by then. I am not the type to believe anything unless i have seen it myself.I know what i seen. Cant explain what it was  but it was alive and real. not like any other animal i have ever seen.

1856,In December of 2010 (I think it was the around the 15th  whatever the 2nd muzzle loading season fell on during that year.) I was going deer hunting on private family property very close to Elkhorn City  Kentucky.  This was my first time going hunting in a while as I had gave up the sport in my late teens/early tewnties and I would have been 30 at the time of the sighting. The road that I had to travel is passable with a 4-wheel drive and is an old mining/logging road.  The terrain is typical Appalachian terrain and the spot that I was headed to (where my tree stand was located) is on a ridge top and somewhat flat from old mining operations but very steep on one side of the road and somewhat flat on the other.  I was hunting with a muzzle loader gun and as I arrived at my parking spot (in a steep curve in the road and and on a long what we call point  a natural crossing place for deer and other wildlife I got out of the drivers side of my truck and walked behind my truck to get to the passenger door to get my gun and load it.  I am not sure of the time but it was well before daylight.  As I was attempting to load my gun I heard what was coyotes  making a lot of noise which is not uncommon but these were close and I have to admit that I got spooked and hurried and got back in the drivers side of my truck  locked the doors and flipped my head lights back on.  My truck was facing the flat area with the point to my back and the steep hillside on my right.  I cracked my window to listen for other sounds and I heard more coyote sounds and in about 2 - 3 minutes time I heard what I knew had to be a large creature coming from the flat area where my truck was facing.  Keep in mind the coyote sounds were coming from the same direction.  Next I saw something that I have never seen before or since.  I saw a creature that had to be at least 8 feet tall.  It came out of the wooded area towards the left side of my truck.  The creature was moving at a quick speed but when it came out of the clearing it seemed to be shocked to see my truck and apprehensive.  It stopped for maybe 5 to 10 seconds and took off and dissappeared behind me.  The creature had the form of a really big man with long arms and longer hair that covered his whole body.  It walked slumped over almost like it had a hunch back.  My total time of seeing the creature was probably about 10 seconds.  Since this occurance I have seen bear while hunting and I can say for sure that what I saw that December morning was not a bear or anything else that I have ever seen in these hills and mountains.  In a nutshell the creature looked ran/walked like what you see on TV reinactments.  I truely believe that on that morning I saw a Squatch.  I can  t describe how I felt after seeing the creature.  I wasn  t scared but I wasn  t totally comfortable either.  I suppose you can say I was bewildered. ,The location is in what used to be called xxxxx  Branch.

1857,Hello my name  is **** and I have a story. I was walking home and I think I saw bigfoot. It was about 2 30 when I was walking down the road in Powell co.I had stop to rest I heard a big splash in the river. I looked around and saw a big shape in the water.I at first thought it was a bear but it stood up it looked like it was fishing. I don  t know how deep the water is but it looked like it was standing about four feet out of the water  and had long shaggy hair. ,Travel about 1 to 2 miles out of Stanton before you get to the dump.In the elbow of the river.

1858,In the evening  my boyfriend and I along with a friend were camping out in Red River Gorge in Kentucky. We got set up  and were sitting outside the tent while it got dark. There were no campfires allowed in the area we were in  so it got dark fairly quick. At around 7pm  a really loud howling sound began not too far away from where we were camped. It sounded like a primate  hooting and howling out in the mountain. It lasted about 10 or 15 seconds  and then stopped. After about midnight  when we were in our tents and trying to go to sleep  twigs and branches were snapping around our tent. Things were being moved  thrown around. My boyfriend got up and loaded his rifle  and lay back down. Whatever it was went away for a little bit. At around 3 in the morning  another ear-piercing scream not ten feet away from our campsite echoed off the trees. We stayed awake after that  and something pulled the tent stake out of the ground on our friends tent a little while later. We got out and looked around  but couldnt see much because it stayed in the treeline. It felt like there were more than one  because it kept hitting sticks against the trees and breaking branches. After the sun came up  whatever it was went away. ,I  m not sure which county we were in  we were far out in Red River Gorge camping alongside a creek. We followed a gravel road quite a ways down before stopping to camp. ,Powell,4,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21197,no
1859,This is the second incident I  ve had at my family  s property in Stanton Kentucky. The first one was scary and all (had a rock thrown at my dads truck and made a huge crash in the dark) but this one has basically scared me away from my parents house at night! This was right before Christmas and we had record high temps close to 70 so I was hanging out on their front porch. Last time I was there I smacked some wood planks together and got a response so I figured I would try again. So I stood up and grabbed a piece of wood (we just built their deck so there are pieces laying around) and hit the hand rail of the deck 3 times very slow. I waited not even 15 seconds and got 3 hits back. I was shocked because it sounded like it was no more then 50 feet away. My mom and dad keep a big spotlight style flashlight right by their front door because I refuse to get out of the car without them shining the light for me lol. I  m a chicken I know. But I ran and grabbed the light and started shining it along the woodline and saw tree branches moving... There was no wind so I know something had to be there. Well I went back in freaking out and sat on the couch... I waited about a hour and went back out and was just standing there and heard footsteps off to the side of their house. Again no more then 50 feet away. This time I didn  t get the light because I didn  t want it to run away... I sat out there for probably 15 minutes and something walked basically back and forth the whole time. I tried to take a video with my phone but it just sounds like someone breathing... ,I would have to talk with someone to explain because it  s way out in the country. It  s on upper Cane Creek in Stanton KY so its easy to  Google. ,Powell,4,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21197,yes
1860,I was home alone at the time watching t.v in the living room when i got a phone call from a family member that lives on the hill behind me saying my cousin  s girlfriend had heard the screams. which I had heard before a few times actually. I muted the t.v and went out on the porch to see if i could hear it. i noticed that the dogs that normally barking were unusually quiet. My cousin said why don  t you do a call to see if you can get a response. So I did a howl and got no response i stood on my porch for about 10 minutes and figured if there was a bigfoot in the area it probably moved on by then. I was just about to go back in the house when I noticed something moving behind a large pine tree that stands in our yard. I stood there for a moment because I thought the chickens might be roosting in the tree when I seen the sasquatch peek around the tree. I saw it and it saw me  our eyes met and he stepped out from behind the tree I ran inside but watched through the open door it kept watching me  then in 3 large steps was across the road and faded into the darkness. It had long brown hair. I measured where it stood after. and where its head was  using the pine tree for scale  I measured ten feet 2 inch tall there was one foot print in the yard I didn  t have any casting supplies so I took a picture of it and measured the foot print at 17 inches. I know what I saw I feel very privileged to have seen it. ,When you reach the city of Morehead KY stay on us 60 East going out of town like your going to Grayson ,Rowan,2,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21205,yes
1861,I am sending you the information I have on two seperate sightings that occurred in the same area but on different days by my grandfather and my father. My grandpa drove a school bus and at about 5;30-6;00 one morning he said that what he thought was a big man with shaggy matted reddish brown hair came out of the woods and stepped up on the road in front of the bus and ran across the road. My grandpa said he thought it was a man until he seen how big it was then he thought it was an ape but it walked like a man only it was slouched over at the shoulders. Some of the old buildings around his house which was close to the sighting at the time had wierd looking hair stuck to the screens where we thought dogs had been going in or something. We never seen anything but we always heard a really scary sound that was like an ape and a chipanzee mixed with human and it would make a screaming howling noise up in the hollow behind there house. The men would all gather up to go out spotting to see if they could find out what it was but they never found anything. When my father seen this creature he was also driving the school bus at about the same time as above he said that there was a path that joined on both sides of the road he said it was a deer run. When he came around the curve there was a big thing that looked like a man and ape with matted patchy red/brown hair like it had been burned or something running down the path so he hit the brakes and the thing ran across the road and down the other path. He watched it til it was gone and then when he got back he was telling my grandpa about it and thats when my grandpa said he seen the same thing about half mile from where my dad seen it. My family still lives in this area of Ky but we haven  t heard or seen anything like this. The year would have been the late 70s for I was little then and I am not sure about the month but I might be able to find out. This took place on Rock Run Road in Vanceburg   Ky 41179.  I would love to go looking for tracks and evidence but I am afraid of what I might find while I am by myself so as soon as I get enough family members willing to go tracking we are gonna look and see if there is anything there. Well thanks for listening hope this helps you find the truth about bigfoot. ,On Highway 59 at the top of Vanceburg Hill  turn left onto Rock Run Road and drive to top of hill.

1862,I was working as a security guard at a strip mine location in the mountains of ky near Whitesburg.  One night after making my rounds I came back to the guard shack  did my report and was just relaxing listening to the rain........that  s when I heard a loud crunching sound beside the shack. So I stood up and watched the shadow from under the sides of the shack.it was moving towards the door. A few seconds later it was trying to open the door by pulling on it. That  s when I yelled what do you want........That was when I heard the most terrifying sound ever  like a screaming howl. And it then began to pull harder on the door. So I got a poker and put it in the coal stove that was our heat source for the shack..it got red glowing hot. I then told whaterver it was what i had and was going to do with it if it opened the door. After a few minutes it got quieter and I watched it  s shadow move from under the door. After several minutes I made a decision to get to my car..I threw open the door of the guard shack so that the light from inside would show a little outside.and I made a run for my car got in locked the doors started it up put it in drive and got on the C.B. radio to inform the other guards of what I had just encountered.I stayed the rest of the night in my car.The next morning when my relief showed up I informed him of what I had encountered and I looked for footprints.but the heavy rainy made it difficult to find any that would be useful. But I know what it was without a doubt.it was A Sasquatch!! ,It was so long ago that I cannot even be sure of what town or hwy was the closest. ,Letcher,2,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21133,yes
1863,I was home alone one mid-October evening.  My husband and I have a cabin located in rural Lee County  KY.  Itâ€™s a primitive cabin  no electricity  no phone  hand pumped water  no neighbors  etc.  My husband was visiting friends about 8 miles away.  Just after dark  I was sitting inside  reading a book  when I heard what sounded like two logs being hit against one another...making a loud  hollow â€œknockingâ€ noise.  The â€œknockingâ€ happened 3 or 4 times in a row...then it paused...â€knockedâ€ again 3 or 4 times in a row...and this was repeated for about 15-20 minutes.   I looked outside but didnâ€™t see a thing.  You canâ€™t hardly see your hand in front of your face at our cabin  unless the moon is out...and it wasnâ€™t.  Just a few minutes after the â€œknockingâ€ stopped  someone or something threw what sounded like a handful of gravel onto the tin roof of the cabin.  We have oak trees around our property but the branches were mostly bare at that time and they donâ€™t hang over the roof...so nothing could have fallen from them onto the roof. Needless to say  I was scared to the bone and didnâ€™t/couldnâ€™t make myself go outside.  My husband left one of his guns at home for protection and I sat on our bed  with the gun next to me facing the door until he got home. When he did get home...I told him what happened.  He went outside and shot his shotgun off into the woods about 10 times.  Later this same evening  he heard something rustling around outside so he went out the front door and shot his .45 off about 12 times into the woods behind the cabin where the noises came from. The next morning  he went outside to take a shower...(we have an outdoor shower behind the cabin)...and he found one of the bullets from the .45 sitting straight up  in the middle of the shower floor like someone just walked over and set it there.  The bullet wasnâ€™t deformed in any way...it didnâ€™t look like it had hit or gone through anything other than the rifling. My husband has always thought there was â€œsomethingâ€ out there...and has never doubted the existence of Bigfoot.  Since that experience  we have become very interested in the Bigfoot sightings  followings  documentaries  websites  etc. and would like to one day participate in the expeditions. ,located in a saddle (a choke-point) of trails  between Fixer Valley and Little Sinking Valley  off of KY 1036 ,Lee,19,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21129,yes
1864,I am an emt-b and a former firefighter from the greenup county ky area. I have had 2 encounters in my lifetime with  what i believe to be  bigfoot/sasquatch. I have told people i have had the encounters  but i have never told any of the details  mainly because I knew no one would believe me if I did. The second encounter  I never really saw the creature  but i know it was there...my first encounter was quite the opposite. i saw the creature up close for at least a few minutes  it was in short  terrifying. My second encounter happened while i was ginseng hunting in late summer. i was right on the outskirts of daniel boone national forest at the rowan/lewis county line in ky just a few hundred yards from cranston rd. i had been in this holler making my way up to the ridge looking for roots for about an hour or so when i heard some brush move about 50 to 75 yrds up the hill from me. i strained hard to see what had made the noise  thinking it may be a deer or maybe even an elk or bear  but saw nothing. As i continued my zig-zag pattern towards the top of the ridge  I heard the noise again. i looked again and saw a flash of black and the brush moved slightly. My next thought was  bear  and not having a firearm with me  i decided it would be best to start back down the hill. as i did  i kept an eye on the area I had seen the movement and to my horror  I realized it was following me down the hill all along making sure it stayed hidden. I could see glimpses of black and the brush and branches move the whole time I was retreating. I know that there is the possibility it was a bear  but what made me so uneasy is the fact that the brush and branches this thing was disturbing were 5 to 6 feet off the ground! knowing that black bears only stand around 3 feet high on all fours and knowing that bears don  t move far on two legs (much less several hundred yards) I really believe what was following me down the hill was a bigfoot. my first encounter was in lawrence county ky when i was around 8 years old...i know it was a long time ago  but I know what I saw and i will never forget it as long as i live. we were staying with relatives (I  m not sure of the exact location now) in an isolated holler between two hills with no other houses around. there were quite a few people there and the little house didn  t have adequate sleeping room  so we put sleeping bags on the floor in the rooms and my cousins and I slept in the floor beside their parents bed. i have always been the first person awake no matter where i sleep and this morning was no different. It was just breaking daylight  the windows in the bedroom were open because it was hot there in august. As i lay there wondering what we would do that day  i saw a figure pass by outside the window next to the bed. My first thought was someone was up and had to run outside for whatever reason  but as soon as that thought was finished  the figure was looking in the open window by the dresser. Words cannot describe the horror i felt. I had never heard of bigfoot at that time  so i was sure king kong was standing outside looking through the open window. I stayed frozen with fear  knowing if the beast saw me watching  it would attack (that was my thought anyway). The next thing i knew  it reached its arm through the window and grabbed a piece of jewelry from off the dresser. the noise it made caused one of the adults to switch positions in the bed and like a shot  it was gone. I told everyone what had happened and they told me it had been around there for years and not to be afraid  because it had never harmed anyone or anything and that it was more afraid of me than I was of it. I don  t know about that  but i do know what i saw. After this incident  I started learning about bigfoot and was and still am convinced that the creature is real. ,The second sighting happened right at the rowan/lewis county line (rowan co side) just across the road from the daniel boone natl forest parking area ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21127,no
1865,the first time i ever saw a sasquatch was in 1991. where i live is pretty rugged terrain so you would believe anything could be out there. i have figured out that if we do have sasquatch occasionally they do not live over hear because they are pretty much immpossible to find because ive been searching for years and one in a blue moon just when you think there is no possible way somthing could be out there you have somthing happen to make you think otherwise. well this is how my first sighting occured  it was about 2 00pm in the middle of April.  i was running through our garden with a bb gun just shooting around being a kid when i ran out of are garden i jumped up on this big rock that was on the top of this revine that lead down into this hollow which at the top of this mountain a small drainage ditch ran into it where i was at. well i jumped up on this rock and said  Bang ! well when i did i heard a branch break on the right of me and immediatly i turned and with in 13   of this creature that was about 5   tall whith this hair that resembled a rabbit in color but was long. it was standing kind of hunched over like a bodybuilder would do when showing his abs  it also had a pointed head but i don  t remember seeing a face and im not going to make one up beacuse i don  t want to tell a lie about somthing i didn  t see. well it turned and ran through the woods away from me and i turned and ran away from it. as i ran i stopped to hear anything and i could still hear it running with lots of branches popping and cracking. as i continued to run i ran in the house to were my mom was and she said i was terrified so i grabbed my real shotgun and my mom and took her beacause i wanted her to see where it was at so we got back there and i found lots of big branches that had been broken and alot of slide marks for it was on a hillside. as i walked the little spilway that meets the revine i founf a very desernable footprint on the bank of it. it was about a size 6 shoe because that is what my moms shoe size is and we had it there for comparison and oddly enough it only had three toes. well this is really all i can tell you about this sighting i had but i will post my others soon. thanks for listening. wes ,hwy 229 to juntion 830 to 1189 ,Laurel,2,Kentucky ,KY,Spring ,21125,no
1866,Would like to talk to someone about noises I  ve been hearing since about 6 months ago. These noises haven  t stopped and I have heard them every week since I  ve lived here for almost a year now and about 4 days ago I had a visual sighting of one about 40-50 feet away from me  they seem so very active around my house and I strongly appreciate if someone could help me in this matter. ,Omitted for privacy reasons. ,Larue,1,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21123,no
1867,I was at Flat Gap with my friend Clay in September 1999. We were throwing rocks to his dog Bonnie when she stopped chasing them and her ears rose.  Mine and Clay  s hearts started pounding. I looked down the hill about 12 feet away when it jolted across the clearing. Clay said he only saw about the last second but I saw it all.  He thought it was a bear like most stupid people do but it ran on two feet like a human.  I have studied bigfoot ever since i could read.  I know it was REAL. ,Flat Gap  its past a church and the Flat Gap school.

1868,I want to start with tonight  while it is fresh in my mind. My girlfriend and I let the dogs out to the bathroom around 1am. She instantly said she thought she heard something in the valley below our home  and shined a flashlight down into the valley. I looked  and my German Shepherd was looking across the valley as well. I figured it was probably a deer  and we walked on out into the yard. I notice the German Shepherd was sticking close to her and her little dog. He seems to think it is his job to protect them both  and does quite well. So it isn  t so unusual for him to follow them  but it was just a little odd at how close he was staying to them. I had forgotten to close the shutters on my chicken coop  (I have shutters that close over the wire) so I walked over to my garage and went behind it to the coop. As I was walking around the garage I heard this loud call/howl. I can not  in any way  shape  or form  even remotely able to describe it by typing this out. I can still hear it in my head  but would be lucky to even try to mimic the sound. It called out once  kind of low  then so loud it filled the area  but with the same vocalization both times. It was so out of place that my girlfriend instantly went into the house with her little dog  and I came back to the yard to check on them. She left the little dog in the house and came back out. She told me the little dog actually ran to the door and wanted in the house when he heard it. I downplayed it to a point  so as not to frighten her any more than she already was. We went back into the house and I got my other dog  and put his leash on him. He is kind of a problem dog  and I have to take him out separate from the other two. He sometimes goes wild on the leash  jumps  pulls and tugs etc... trying to get to our cats (which were no where to be found tonight) and it is just a lot easier to take him out alone. He behaved perfectly tonight  and just kept looking for something out in the darkness. He actually acted as if he didn  t even want to go out at first. Just a few minutes after taking him outside  the calls started again. This time they were a little further from my home. The first time they were on the hill opposite my home  maybe a hundred yards away. The second time they were maybe two hundred yards away  and I could hear the cattle in the field closest to them calling out for each other and sending out their alarms. The calls kept up for a good two or three minutes  and quite frankly sounded like some sort of challenge. One of my neighbors has a bunch of hunting dogs they keep outside. They normally bark and go off at anything and everything. Tonight  you wouldn  t have any idea they were even there. Not one of them made as much as a whine. They were completely silent. We have coyotes all over the place  and I hear them pretty much every night. A couple times a week I will even hear them in the day time. I  m  very  familiar with the sounds the Eastern Coyote makes  and this was no coyote. I am an  avid  outdoors type  and have spent more time in the woods then most. I know most of the sounds or calls any of the local wildlife make  and I have never heard anything like this in all my life. I  m well aware that a small animal can sound much bigger then it is in the quietness of night  but this thing was un-mistakenly large. Just the amount of lung capacity it would have to have to make that vocalization would dictate that it was fairly large. You may think I  m crazy to make such an issue about some sounds in the night  but had you heard these calls  I would imagine your mind would be spinning much the same as mine. As I said  I am an avid outdoors type. I  ve sat on a river/creek bank with no one around many nights  alone and in the middle of the night. The only thing I ever worry about is maybe someones dog running loose and running into it in the middle of the night. There are times I  ve sat out alone every night for a week straight. There are times I have gone into the woods five days a week for a month straight. Yet this thing tonight made me nervous to even step back out onto my deck to grab a paint-brush I had left in paint on the porch. There are some other things that have happened  and I will get into those now. I just wanted to describe all this first  while it is fresh in my mind. I live in East Jessamine County. This is one of the highest areas in this part of the state  and very lowly populated for the Central Kentucky area. I have a few neighbors  but only one that is fairly close. Our home sits at the top of a mountainous region made up of about eight peaks that look like hilltops. I think the area is fifty feet too short to be a mountain  but it is pretty much the same thing. My home sits right in the middle of those peaks. You go almost to the top and turn down my driveway and drive down to the house. The home sits on a flat area and over-looks part of the valley area between the hills/summits. There is a creek that runs through the middle and flows until it runs into the Kentucky River  which is about a mile away from my home. The area is a mix of woodland and pasture land with some cattle. This is the part of the river called the Palisades  with high rock walls  hundreds of feet high. On the other side of the river is Madison County  and there are no homes for at least a few miles. Last summer we heard what we thought was a small animal making noises on the roof. I ended up getting on the roof to find a leak  and there was probably fifty or more small rocks on top of my roof. I assumed it was the neighbors kids  even though I had never seen them in our yard  or even on my property. I thought maybe they had snuck over one day when we were gone. The neighbors moved though  and the rocks continued. I had no idea what was doing it. We kept smelling a very foul smell  but it was only once in a while. We smelled it mostly at night  but a few times during the day. Then one day about dusk I smelled it when I was walking to my garage  which is about thirty yards from my back door. I ignored it  but a few minutes later I heard an awful scream. This sounded like a scream of rage  and snapped me right out of my thoughts and had my full attention in an instant. It was nothing I have ever heard  and after tonight  I feel that it was from the same creature. We let the dogs out one night last summer and my girlfriend shined her light into the valley below our home. There was a set of glowing red eyes looking right back at us  and they were about eight feet high. I know they were eight feet high because there was a post sitting right beside where the eyes were  and the post is eight foot tall. There are actually four post there  made from an old light pole. The people who lived here before us used it as a dog pen  but I just have some blackberry bushes in it and it seems to protect them more from the deer. Not long after that is when I actually saw it. It was early fall and about 11pm. I was outside with one of my dogs/the mixed breed. He saw something and was looking down into the valley  so I started looking as well. I have the yard fairly lit up  and the moon was putting off quite a bit of light. A large doe walked by right on the fringe of the light  about 25 yards from where I was standing on my driveway. A few second later. it walked by  right behind the doe. It came from behind a cedar tree  walked through an open area about 30 feet  and vanished behind another cedar tree. I had a side view of it for all of those thirty feet. It was the same height as the tree it vanished behind  and I later measured that tree at eight feet tall. The whole body was covered with hair about two inches long  but the hair on the head and neck area seemed to be pointed in the same general direction  and just a little longer then the body hair. It either had no neck  or the hair kept it covered  as it looked like a block shaped head sitting on the shoulders. The creature  s arm moved as it walked  it made no noise at all  and it walked very much like a man  only much too fast to be a man in some kind of suit. A man would have to run to move that fast  and this thing was walking  and walking deadly silent. I  m pretty sure the doe had no idea it was there  as she was just casually walking along. The creature never dropped to all fours  and I don  t believe it is even possible for a bear to walk on two legs that easily. This thing had no problem walking on two legs  and did so as easy as a man. In-fact  it moved a lot easier than a man could through that area. From my side view  I could also see that it had no snout like a bear  and the face seemed to be flat. The body was huge and bulky  yet moved easily and effortlessly. I would estimate it at five hundred pounds  easy. I  m a big guy and it was two feet taller then I am  and the arm I could see looked to be around three times bigger then my own. It was big.  The chest area was not shaped like that of a bear either. It was much more flat  as in up and down  and did not protrude outward like a bear on its hind legs. You could see this things huge muscles moving as it walked  even in the low light. I fought with myself over what I saw  but I saw what I saw. It could not have been anything else. I had much too good of a view. I have no intentions of trying to harm it  but I don  t go outside at night without my shotgun anymore  and carry it with me if I am even going to be away from the house in broad daylight. The next day I went down to where I saw it  and found a partial print that was twice the size of my hand. It was that back half of the foot  and I can not even imagine how big the entire print would be. I wanted to make a cast of it  but have no idea how to do that. I looked up how on the internet  but didn  t have the items to make the plaster. I do have some pictures of human-like feces I have been finding around the farm. I have also had some blackberry bushes just completely vanish  and one of the piles of feces was found right where the blackberry bushes vanished. I don  t think I took a picture of the partial print because it wasn  t very defined in the hard ground. I may have  but will have to check my old phone. There is more  but I think I have covered most of what I can remember. I started keeping a journal  and have the dates and times to some other things that have happened as well. It seemed to have vanished for most of this summer  but now seems to be back for about the last month. I had gotten a little lax  but wont be after those calls tonight. They very much sounded like some sort of challenge being issued  and I felt it in my bones. From what I gather  it seems to come up from the river area sometimes  and even tonight when I heard it off in the distance  it was heading back towards the river. I have no proof  but it is my opinion that it comes up here to hunt  or feed on the berries that grow everywhere. ,Please do not post this online. ,Jessamine,1,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21113,yes
1869,There is not a lot to this incident  other than it occurred several (two or three) times over a summer. I was around 10 years old  and had all but forgotten these incidents in the following quarter century. Listening to the HOWL.WAV of the Ohio Bigfoot struck a real responsive chord. If I had to try and duplicate the sound that was heard  that would be as close as I could come. Oh  you may have figured out by this time  we heard a sound. This was in a small  lower middle-class community that was not quite suburbs  not quite farms. Most houses sat on plots of land that were an acre or more. Though there were clusters of them that were spaced more like a regular neighborhood. Over that particular summer  the area was spooked by several nights of  howling . No sightings  that I recall  no tracks  just a low  moaning howl. My mother called me out of the house one night  to see if I could identify the source of this noise. I listened  it was fairly far off and difficult to hear and  of course  every dog in the area was putting their two cents in...and there were a lot of dogs... But it was like nothing I had ever heard before or since. As I said  the Ohio recording comes very close  other than there was maybe more or a moaning quality to what we heard. The serenade went on for five or six minutes  I remember it fading  not just cutting off. Almost as if whatever was howling was moving away from my ear-shot. I  ll admit  I was ten years old and it scared the hell out of me. My father worked nights and I was  The Man  of the house when he was away...and I was frightened... The performance repeated a week or so later  this time the howling was closer...A neighbor said he  d pinpointed the source as coming from the flood wall at the end of our road. This was a large  mounded ridge that ran the length of the area and kept the Ohio River from flooding the farmland when it over-flowed its banks. On the other side of the ridge was a VERY deep  fairly thickly wooded  ditch  area. A creek ran through the area that was maybe twelve feet across and three feet deep in places. Forgive my rambling  I am typing all this as it comes to me. I have never sat and sorted this out... The howls came back again at least once  later in the summer. The neighbors were spooked by these incidents  as I said  but I don  t believe anything ever came of it. There might have been a local news report on them  but I can  t swear to it. Thanks for the opportunity to share this story. Hope it is of some use. Actually  I am hoping someone in particular is drawn to this sight and reads and recognizes this. Friends fade over time  but best friends are eternal. I  d like to talk to him again.  ) ,Pleasure Ridge Park  Kentucky (Jefferson County). Area south of Louisville and closest to Shively  Kentucky.

1870,I was standing in my front doorway changing a light bulb and I heard a popping/cracking sound that I had never heard before I looked down and both of my cats were running up the sidewalk to me maybe a minute after I looked up across the highway behind my mailbox and there was  something about 7 to 8 feet tall just walking by calm as could be. It was huge it  s color was very light white/brown it  s arms was at it  s knees and I was not the only one who seen it that year our county sheriff seen it at his house as well I know the sheriff very well and I know he would not lie about somthing like this he tracked it for about a mile behind his house and found some of it  s hair on his fence ,the location was in a hay field on new zion on 587 ,Jackson,47,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21109,yes
1871,I have two incidents.  One is a vocalization and the other a sighting.  I was about 15 at the time. Vocalization   My Dad  his best friend  and myself were bow hunting on the Heckley mine property.  We arrived about an hour before sunup.  Dad dropped me off at my stand and followed the trail to his blind.  His friend went down the trail to his stand. My stand was on the wooded edge of a coal flat surrounded by forrest on three sides.  The fourth side had an opening through the woods that had been used to allow trucks to haul the coal( I think ).  The flat was about 60 yards wide and deep and roughly circular in shape.  I was on the edge closest to the truck path and had several deer trails intersecting from the woods on each side of me and continuing across the flat and onto the truck path.  Almost directly in front of me across the flat was a hill with a power line cutthrough. To my right was the truck path and beyond it was some thick woods that ran up the hill and formed the right side of the cutthrough. I had just gotten settled into my stand when I heard something running down the hill and through the woods on the other side of the truck path.  It was still too dark to see but I assumed it was a severely spooked deer because it sounded large and it was loud.  When the sound seemed to get to the edge of the flat it stopped  for a moment. The next thing I heard was something running back and forth in the woods on the flats   edge. Back and forth back forth then it would stop and I would hear a loud knocking sound like a woodpecker only much louder and much slower. Knock....knock....knock...then more running sounds.  This continued three or four more times.  I was trying to figure out what the heck it was when I heard a scream that sent ( and still does thinking about it ) a shudder and cold chill down my spine.  I  ve heard wildcats scream  I  ve heard coyotes making some odd sounds  but this was unlike anything I  ve ever heard.  It was very loud deep and guttural but with a high pitch to it at as well.  After the first scream it started running again  then knocking  then screaming again.  Over and over and in the same pattern. Needless to say I was beyond spooked.  Luckily the sun was starting to rise but I still couldn  t see anything in that area.  The next thing I know the sounds stop  I hear running up the hill  and I hear something walking up the trail behind and to my left.  It was my Dad  s best friend who had been in his stand and was coming to see what was making that sound.  He was shaken as well. When my Dad came out he hadn  t heard anything.  His blind was a good ways off and in the bottoms. Sighting  The exact same area as before one week later. I was sitting in my stand as the sun came up.  For some reason I kept being drawn to the power line hill.  It was still early October so everything  grass included was mostly green but there was this big brown bushes sitting to my left of the power line that I had never noticed before.  I realized what was also odd was that it seemed to be swaying slightly in the wind and there was no wind.  As I  m sitting there watching it...the bush stood up.  It had the shape of a man.  A head  arms  legs  etc.  It was a medium brown color and was huge. I was beyond stunned.  My mouth dropped open my heart started beating faster.  I heard a bird whistle to my right  it was my Dad  s  in the woods signal .  He was sitting not 20 yards from me on a hill on the flat  s edge.  He pointed to his eyes  and pointed up the hill.  Basically asking me did I see what he was seeing.  I nodded. We continued watching it as it started walking toward the right side woods.  It would take a couple of steps  stop  and look our way.  It did this until it entered the woods.  This all probably happened quickly but seemed like slow motion to me. I started climbing out of my stand and Dad came over and said we were going home.  He was shaken as well.  We didn  t say much until we got in the truck and started home.  Then we talked about how big it was and what we had seen and how maybe that was what had made all that noise the week before.  We think we saw a Sasquatch  but we still don  t know what the heck it was. ,These encounters occurred on the property of the Heckley mines. ,Hopkins,6,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21107,yes
1872,In the fall of 1978 we were in the house eating supper. Our house was built into the hillside.The front yard dropped off 200 feet to the road below  then dropped again to a small creek. Across this creek was our horse barn and chicken coop located in a small bottom. A hitching post was located to the side of this barn about 3 feet high. As we were eating supper  we could hear the horses down at the barn making a lot of noise  kicking the barn and nickering. My parents sent us down to see what was the matter. My brother and I went down the trail that led to the road. You could see down to the barn at the bottom. I will never forget what we saw. A very tall  hairy creature was standing by the hitching post to the right of the barn. The hitching post only came to it  s knees  and the hands were hidden by the log at the top. My brother took off back up the hill to the house  but I stood there  maybe out of fright  and watched as it walked off. It was very tall and covered with hair. I could not make out many details  but the thing that struck me most was the long strides it took and the way it swung it  s arms very smooth and graceful. It seemed to turn it  s head toward me but I never at any time felt threatened. It disappeared into the trees and I could hear it as it moved uphill  but it didn  t crash loudly  just the rustling of bushes. At this point I took off. ,It  s been a long time since we lived there.

1873,In 1981 me and my brother-in-law were going to work. I saw something ahead of us kneeled down alongside the road. As we approach it it stood up and walked backwards into center of road squated and looked at us then leaped over the inbankment. It was about 7 feet tall  big legs  small upper body with thin longer hair on chest and arms  short neck and short thick hair on legs  dark brown in color. We got within 20 to 30 feet of it.

1874,When I was 14  I had gotten up early one Saturday morning to go squirrel hunting on a small piece of property by my parents house. This stretch of woods is located in Greenup County Kentucky in Northeastern KY. The property is bordered by a small creek  Raccoon Creek   and a river  the  Little Sandy . I hunted this area on a daily basis when I was younger and had never seen anything unusual. On this particular day in early September  there was a heavy dew on the trees so it was easy to hear anything moving as the dew would fall and make a very distinct noise. I was walking down the ridge top overlooking Raccoon creek and had not made any noise since arriving way before daylight. As often happened  my neighbors dog followed me that day and I thought I had ran him off a couple of hours earlier. Everything was completely still with almost no wind that morning. I started to hear the dog   Gruffy  start barking and growling in a way that I had never heard before. At first I tried to ignore the noise but after a few minutes I decided to go run him off again as he was destroying my hunt. As I quietly eased down the ridge about 50 yards  I saw what I thought to be a young bear through the trees. The animal was standing on it  s back legs and was only around 6   tall. I noticed that as Gruffy would lunge at the animal it would knock him back with its hands. He would let out a yelp and then go back after the animal. I eased closer being as quiet as possible planning to shoot near the animal to keep it from killing the dog. As I got directly above the animal it noticed me and turned to look directly at me. This is when I noticed that it was not a bear. I did not immediately distinguish the animal as a Sasquatch but was very confused as to what I was looking at. The animal growled visciously which scared me more than I have ever been scared. When Gruffy noticed me he ran to me and kept barking at the animal. I thought about shooting the animal but decided that with a 20 gauge shotgun at this distance with #6 shot that I would just tick it off. I started to walk backward slowly. After 3-4 steps the animal let out a blood curdling growl. I literally threw my shotgun down and ran home. When I got home  I told my father about what had happened. After he got over the fact that my gun was still in the woods  he decided to grab his rifle and take me back to get the gun. He would not accept that this was anything other than a bear. I have never spoken of this encounter because if my father would not believe me then who would? Although black bears are in the area  I have only seen one in the wild in the area. I have been an avid hunter my entire life and hunt everything from Ginseng and Yellow Root to big game. I still am not entirely sure of what I saw that day but I know it was not a bear and it was not a human. A human couldn  t possibly make the sounds that this animal made at the volume it made them. , ,Greenup,3,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21089,yes
1875,When I was around 10  11 or 12 (1975-77) Sorry  I don  t remember exactly -- it  s been a while. When I was a kid  My grandparents had a little bitty camper at a campsite at Nolin Lake. I couldn  t tell you precisely where it was either. If I had to  I could probably get my father to tell me where it was  but that would mean I  d have to tell him this story ... Anyway ... one summer my father took the family (me  my sister and mother) to my grandparents site for a little vacation. One evening as it was becoming dusk  I remember standing inside the camper looking out the screen door at my father who was cooking at the grill. The campsite sat at the top of a hill in a wooded area. The woods consisted mostly of old growth  deciduous trees  so there weren  t really any evergreens or shrub-type trees like cedars which could really block your view. So I was looking out the door at my father who was on my left and eventually  out of boredom I guess  I ended up scanning to the right and down the hill into the woods. I remember seeing about midway down the hill  something that caught my eye. You know how when you think you see something and in a split second your mind says   Did I just see what I THOUGHT I saw?  Well that  s what happened to me. There he was. Midway down the hill -- I  m getting chills right now typing this -- partially hidden behind a tree was this  man thing  I could see his whole head  his right shoulder and part of his leg coming out from behind the tree. He/it was grayish brown and he was looking right at me (Maybe not -- but it sure felt like he was looking at me) I looked away thinking I had to be imagining it but when I looked back  it was still there and I had no problem picking him out from the trees. At that point my mother who was cooking at the stove behind me said something to me and I turned around to talk to her. When I looked back outside down the hill  he was gone. I kept looking through all the trees  but I couldn  t find him. After that I was scared. I didn  t leave the camper the rest of the night. I was an avid comic book reader at the time  so I used that as an excuse to stay in. I remember I kept looking out the door that night just to check around and see if he came back and my parents kept asking me to come out and sit by the fire ... I didn  t dare tell my parents about what I saw because my father  s teasing is legendary in my family. He  s the oldest of 7 boys so he REALLY nows how to get under your skin. What I saw was big and burley and it didn  t make any sounds that I can remember. It had a big  squarish head (kind of blocky with rounded corners) that looked like it sat right on its shoulders. I really don  t recall seeing a neck. I could see a massive shoulder and a thick bicep. I could also see its chunky hip and a good portion of its thigh down to about it  s knee. All the rest was hidden behind the tree. From time to time I  ll see an animal show that will feature a three toed sloth  and every time I see a sloth I always think   That sloth  s hair looks like that bigfoot I saw when I was a kid  If you want  I can draw what I saw if that helps any. ,At this moment I don  t know the location because I was so young. ,Grayson,8,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21085,yes
1876,I saw something along Interstate 75 South in Kentucky  maybe 30-40 miles south of Cincinnati. I don  t recall exactly where along that highway I was at the time  somewhere after three lanes had been reduced to two. And it happened 4-5 years ago  in 1999 or 2000. I don  t recall what time of year it was  maybe autumn. It never occured to me to report it  and I just found this site so I thought I  d let you decide if it has any merit. It was late  between 1-2 AM  and I was heading back to Winchester  KY (20 miles E of Lexington on Interstate 64) after a visit to PA. No other traffic was on the road at the time I sighted what appeared to be a large animal standing in a recess along a road cut  which I wouldn  t have seen but for my headlights; there were no street lights or other sources of light. It stood erect and was covered in dark fur like a bear  which I imagined it must be  but it had no muzzle like a bear. I wondered if it could have been an elk because it was the right height  but I couldn  t reconcile an elk with the other body features. It was only in view for 3-4 seconds and was not moving  only looking directly at my car as I sped by. I passed within 15-20 feet of it. I looked directly at it  and it had an angry expression on its face. It made my hair stand on end. I usually didn  t travel via Cincinatti when I lived in Winchester (I live in Lexington now)  and in subsequent trips along that stretch of road I have been unable to find the exact spot at which I sighted it. Perhaps the roadway has since been modified to eliminate overhanging rocks; there has been a lot of road work along that stretch in the last few years. And I  ve wondered if it was just the play of shadows from my headlights that gave the illusion of something standing there  but the shape of a shadow changes as the light source moves  and this figure did not change. I was not sleepy; I work a night shift so I  m usually awake at that time. I  m reasonably certain I saw something  just not sure what. In summary  whatever I saw was 6-6.5 feet tall  dark brown to black fur  bipedal posture  angry demeanor. And it appeared to be holding its arms/paws up at shoulder height  as though it were a tree  or stiking some pose intended to frighten me  which was very effective. My initial impression was that it struck a very human posture. I heard no sound and it it not move.  ,30-40 miles south of Cincinnati  OH on Interstate 75. ,Grant,9,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21081,yes
1877,In 1983 I was 14 years old and had the bright idea to make money by collecting mistle toe and with the help of my brother and 2 friends process and package the plants. First we had to find some so off we went to an area where we had never gone sense we moved to the area in 1979. When we arrived in the area in question it was around 330pm it was an average late november day in kentucky. Conditions were over cast  cold (40-50) and dry. As we made our way into and through the woods we found a logging road. the road was around 300 yrds in the woods and a dividing line between the two tree types. Once on the logging road we turned to the east and started up the road. After about 40-50 yrds or so we noticed several cows running about in the woods and a bull standing in the road just ahead. the bull kept looking to his right  our left at a large tree that was about 20 ft off the road. There were some smaller trees and cedar trees also from the road to the much larger tree that was about 4ft wide at the base. When we were in line with the tree we looked where the bull was still looking when we saw what was very clearly a very large bipedal creature with light brown hair from head to toe. I couldnt make out any facial features and the creature made no sounds even when I shouted bigfoot and the 4 of us ran directly to the south out of the woods which was around 300 yrds. We never went back there again and I have only told 1 other person about my encounter. I can honestly say that even with the training I had in the millitary and with law enforcement I would not go back there even if i were armed! ,from Farmdale subdivision nnw appx 1.5 to 2 miles across several farms you will come to some very dense old growth hard woods and many ceader trees of varying sizes. the location of the sighting was with in these woods. ,Franklin,23,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21073,yes

1879,About a month ago around 9 30pm cst  I was going out to feed my dogs after working outside with the kids all day  when I heard 3 SOLID wood knocks. The series was immediately followed by a horrific cry like I  ve never heard before (or since until I watched the show you did in Indiana) - the series of Knocks done in Morgan forest sounded more hollow than the knocks I heard at my house - the call or scream was dead on - except the one I heard lasted longer). After dropping the bag and running in  I gained my composure and attempted to feed my dogs again about 1/2 hr later and the same thing happened again! I freaked out and woke up my husband which I had never done before over a sound (and we  ve lived here secluded on the banks of rough river since 1994 - so I  m used to bobcats  coyotes and various other creatures. This was not like any I had heard except for the show. Anyway  I just mustered up the courage to go where I thought the sound came from and there were foot prints - very large and they looked like they had two big toes. Also  I have trained SAR tracking and AKC certified tracking bloodhounds and scented them from the track. They work the track for about twenty minutes and came up on a track and stopped dead in their tracks and refused to go any further (which they have NEVER done before). Anyway  I saw you show yesterday on iTunes and it hit me that I had to go look. ,We are on the banks of rough river.

1880,It was approximately 11 00 P.M.  Me and a friend of mine were walking down a gravel road near my house.  We observed a large object in the middle of the road about 200 yards from our position.  It looked similar to a large ball or something.  My first thought was that it was maybe a tree stump or a large rock was in the middle of the road.  Then I began to wonder how such a large object ended up in the road to begin with. We continued walking towards the object.  Once we were within 100 yards of this thing  we observed this large black creature rise up from a crouched position and face us.  This thing had to have been at least 8 feet tall.  We could not make out any distinguishing features  but we did see that it was black  and appeared to have fur that sort of glistened in the moonlight.  When we saw this creature  we immediately froze (we were petrified) and observed it for about 20 seconds.  I believe it was looking at us but I can  t say for sure because it was so dark.  After that  it turned and walked into the woods next to the road. After it walked into the woods  my friend and I turned around and ran pretty fast to get away from the area. ,I lived in a hollow during this incident.  It had one paved road and several gravel roads.  all of the gravel roads are surrounded with trees. ,Greenup,3,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21089,yes
1881,well it was really dark outside and i could not make a good visual of the creature but it was unlike anything i have ever seen before in my life.  If was about 8ft tall and i would say about 450 pounds.  it was walking like a human kinda but not exactly.  It was very hairy looking and was making some weird grunting noises.  Then when it saw me i about **** my pants i was so scared i thought about running but i was too scared to run so i stayed and then it left i was so relieved. There is such a thing as bigfoot i took pictures of his foot prints in the mud and i think that they should send researchers out here to look for it i believe that you will find it actually i promise you will find it. ,Start at Raceland Super Quik  Gas Station  on US23 and head towards Greenup until you get to the caution lights on the highway.

After you go through the gates you stay on the main road which is blakctoped and you stay on that road for about 2 miles and then it turns to gravel.  Follow the gravel road until you come to another set of gates and go through them. Stay on the gravel for about 2 miles then there is a dirt road to the left follow it to pine thicket and then you go up this real steep hill and that is the area where i saw bigfoot. ,Greenup,3,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21089,no
1882,A friend and I were camping close to the Kentucky/Virginia line in Harlan county Kentucky we went to dig ginseng roots we were camped below a cliff-line in deep woods and were asleep when we were awakened by howls and screams. The vocalizations started out like an owl sound  but became growls  that merged back into a howling at the end.Trees were shook and objects were thrown into our campsite. Small sapling trees were thrown  roots first  across our campsite.We would build up the fire and it would go away  but when the fire would die down it would return.This continued for hours until almost daybreak.We found sapling trees broken off and uprooted all around our camp. We tried to pull up a tree slightly smaller than the ones uprooted but both of us together couldn  t pull one out of the ground.I would gladly submit to a polygraph test to prove my truthfulness. ,On highway 38 on the Ky Va line headed toward Va from Ky we headed into the woods to the left of the road and traveled northwest all day then camped. ,Harlan,5,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21095,no
1883,It was the opening morning of Kentucky black powder deer hunt. I had found a saddle on a map that was almost 3 miles back into the hills. I went into the saddle 2 days before and found a big rock over looking the draw and the ridge that leads into the saddle. It was some where around 1 hour before day light that I was slipping up the ridge about 1/4 mile from the big rock. All at once something jumped up out of the tall grass on my left side. Then all at once another something jumped up. I turned my 2 AA flashlight on and turned it at what ever jumped up. 2 sets of red/ orange colored eyes was looking at me no more then 50 yards away. The biggest of the 2 looked to be around 7 ft to the eyes. The other was about 2 ft smaller. With my small light I could not see for sure what I was looking at. All I could see was 2 dark things looking at me. All at once they took off running and the eyes disappeared. I spotted the eyes again going out the ridgeline about 100 yards in front of me. I thought it was bears standing up looking at me in the grass so I didn  t think much of it. I got to the rock and set up my gear for my hunt. I wear scent lock clothes when I deer hunt and I also drag a rag with deer pee on it behind me to mask my scent. I tied my orange vest up in a limb over my head so other hunters could see me. I put my ghillie suit on and set back waiting on daylight. Right at the break of daylight I was looking into the saddle for a buck.  All at once a stick about 2 foot long come flying at me and landed right behind me. I turned and looked and seen this big black brown monkey looking thing squatted down looking at me about 50 yards away. My first thought was somebody was teasing me or was trying to run me off. I stand up and yelled HEY YOU BETTER SAY SOMETHING OR I WILL SHOOT ..... I pointed my black powder and it moved its arm back and I could see it had another stick in its hands. I yelled again... All at once it come rushing at me. I shot in front of it and it turned and took off. It went about 75 yards and stopped. It stood up and looked over toward a thicket and grunted. A smaller one come running out making a crying sound. By this time I had already reloaded and was headed off the rock away from the things. I walked out away from the rock and left all my gear. The next day I went back in to get my gear. When I got there my backpack was tore open and my things were laying everywhere. I had crackers and potted meat and some coke colas. The cans had been hit on the rock and busted open. Anything that was food was ate. I had a knife and a game boy in my pack also. They were still there ....... that proves to me it was not somebody...they would have took them. The limb my vest was on was broken out. My drag rag was gone. I think I seen a mom and a baby bigfoot. Where I had on scent lock clothes and had deer pee on a drag rag they could not smell I was human. Also I had a ghille suit on. I think it thought I was one of them. ,Old reclamation stripped mine.

1884,In October 2008 we went on a 4 wheeler trip to Harlan county   in eastern Kentucky near the Big Black Mountain area  we do this several times each year. My friend   (Ricky)  also brought along 2 of his friends who were visiting him from Florida. Let me add here that these 2 men are also great hunters  and trackers as is  Ricky  which is how they became friends in the first place....   Now on to the story...............  On the 2nd morning of our ride we were off the regular riding trails  and into some very thick forested area  and sometimes you could say we were not even on a trail at all. We rounded a small hill which headed down  into a large valley  and across from us on the opposite hillside  in the direction we were heading to stood up a large Black Bear. To say the least we were very excited  and we immediately sped up to try to get a closer look at him before he ran away.  It was plain to see that what little trail we were trying to follow would take us right up the hillside where the Bear was heading  so off we went as fast as we could go.  When we reached the top of the hill  the Bear was already gone into the deep woods  and could no longer be seen.   We stopped our 4 wheelers  and sat there getting ready to talk about what we had just seen  when one of the guys from Florida said  well look at this fella  s  Let me also add here that it had rained the day before we arrived so there were many places along the trails that still had water in the old 4 wheeler tracks  and lots of fresh mud.........  So right there in the middle of the trail was a set of very large foot prints   heading along the trail  on up the mountain  but not along the path the Bear had just taken.  I knew immediately what I was seeing from the many Bigfoot tracks I have seen on web-sites  from books  and even TV programs  but I didn  t know what to say  so I waited.   The other man from Florida said  ( you know what that looks like? ) no one said anything  so he went on and said  ( that  s one of them Bigfoot prints ) I almost fell off my 4 wheeler  I said (do you really think so?)  he said (sure   if you hunt as much as we do back in Florida  its not unusual to see them on occasion)  I can  t begin to tell you how relieved I was to hear them say this  as I have always been very discreet with my belief in Bigfoot  s existence  and as a Pastor/Minister you have to be so careful around people.   Now for the real shocker..........   I looked at my friend  Ricky  and said (well Rick  what do you think?)  and he looked me straight in the eye and said  ( I know they exist I  ve seen one before )   I literally jumped off my 4 wheeler and said ( you got to be kidding me )  We then both learned that although we had been friends for all these years  we had never talked about Bigfoot to each other  and now I find out that he once saw one  needless to say I was blown away from this revelation.   I want to leave that story for another post  later.  some added info on this story...... ( there were a total of 4 tracks (2 left and 2 right footprints)   going in a straight line right up the middle of the trail.  Each print was around 4 to 5 inches wide  and at least 14 to 15 inches long  from toe to heel.   ( I want to add here that the prints gave the impression that they looked longer because of the up-hill climb  and the slippery mud)  but this is just my impression from first looking at the tracks. Each track had 1 Big Toe  and there were sometimes 3 other toe  s  and on one track there was 4 toe  s  or what looked like the slight imprint of a 4th toe.    The length of the stride was somewhere near 4 1/2  to 5 feet...... This is only a guess  because none of us had a ruler  or tape measure.      ,Follow the railroad tracks East out of town and take Nance Lane North ,Harlan,5,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21095,yes

1886,Three friends and myself were camping out the night before the opening morning of deer season Nov.7 to be exact. We had set up camp in an area known as Lonesome Woods which covers about three counties. It was really cold and we had a really big fire going and we were all sitting around it to stay warm  when all of a sudden this weird moaning sound filled the woods. It sounded kind of like a siren except it was very loud. It let off a series of three moans starting low building and then dropping  pitch as well as volume  in three bursts. This scared us because we all grew up in this area and have hunted and camped out here all of our lives and have never heard such a cry. Not wanting to act scared we tried to laugh it off but an uneasy feeling lingered throughout the camp for quite a while. That happened about 9 00. About 10 30 T.  one of my friends who was camping with us  stepped out into the woods to relieve himself. He wasn  t gone for about 10 minutes when he came running back to camp saying  I  m gone and if you all have any sense you  d leave to .  We asked him what was wrong and he told us he had seen something down by the creek located on the other side of the hill. It stood about 8 feet tall and appeared to be drinking from the stream as he came across the hill. Once on top of the hill it took notice of him stood up and watch him  or as T. said  watched me run.  T. hadn  t much more than got the words out of his mouth when we heard a something running through the brush on top of a hill. My brother had a mining light (plus it was very bright from the moon that night  the sky was spotless)shined up on the hill to see a silhouette of a very large creature running on top of the hill. We couldn  t make out a color but it was human shaped with long arms and ran kind of hunched over. It looked to be about 8 feet tall. The sound it produced while running was amazingly loud it sounded as though a truck was being driven over a road of branches and twigs. This was enough for us  scared out of our wits we packed up what little we had and left. we have heard a lot of stories about this area and now we believe them there is something in those woods without a doubt. ,Hopkins County  Kentucky an area called Lonesome Woods Highway 800 nearest town would be White Plains . ,Hopkins,6,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21107,yes
1887,Myself and a friend were bored one afternoon so we decided to take his dad  s small john boat and look around some creeks just a couple miles from his house.After putting in a time or two we found one that kept going and stayed wide and deep enough to follow it for awhile.We only had paddles so we moved fairly quiet i guess.After paddling for a few hours and having to get out from time to time and drag the boat over beaver dams it had became late afternoon and the sun started to go down.We had been talking and laughing the whole time so we really weren  t trying to be quiet.As we rounded a bend in the creek we both saw a large piece of rock come flying out of the trees and land in the middle of the creek making a big splash probably about 50 yards or so ahead of us.At the time i was a police officer and was armed pretty much everywhere i went.That particular day we had been shooting trash like cans and bottles that we found alongside the roadway just up from where we put in at so we were both armed.My friend immediately opened fire with warning shots in the general direction where the rocks came from  5 or 6 shots as i was trying to turn the boat around.We normally wouldn  t have freaked out like that but it was the manner in which it occurred that scared us.The rock appeared to be bigger than anything either of us could  ve picked up let alone throw like that.Another thing was the height from which it came.Which was about 2 or 3 feet higher than i am tall from what i saw and i am 6 foot one.Also it was heavily wooded flat swampy creek bottoms so it didn  t just fall from anywhere and had the circumstances been where it could  ve fallen it would  nt have landed in the middle of the creek.It would  ve just landed on the bank.After we got turned around and started paddling like crazy in the other back toward the truck we didn  t hear or see anything but we still didn  t waste any time.As it got darker we started hearing footsteps up in the woods on our left.I say  footsteps  cause it didn  t sound like any deer hooves that i had ever heard it sounded like somebody large and heavy.When we  d stop paddling it would stop walking.It would walk only when we paddled.This went on all the way to the point where we got close enough to the road to hear traffic going by and it was all the way dark by then and had been for some time.Once we got to the road we loaded up and got out of there in a hurry not hearing anything else and very shaken.There were no houses for miles in either direction from where we parked other than my friend  s house which was a few miles to the west and nothing to the east for roughly 5 miles.The property that the creek runs on is a 3000 acre tract of land that used to be a coal mine but had been shut down for several years.I tried to explain it away to myself but it just didn  t add up.I always figured even if it had been some person large enough to throw a rock that size they would  ve said something when my friend opened fire on em  .And they sure wouldn  t have followed us all the way back to the road for fear of being shot at again you would think.The swamp we were in runs across several counties  and is largely unpopulated in most parts so who knows. ,There are other waterways that connect with the creek we were on and these bottoms run thru several counties.Head out of madisonville on hwy70 west to Beulah.Turn right on hwy109 north until you reach hwy502 which turns to the right just past a community called Rabbit Ridge.Follow it until you reach a swamp that is on both sides of the road about 4 miles or so off hwy109 on hwy502.We put in on the right side about 3/4 to a mile from the entrance to the old coal mine. ,Hopkins,6,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21107,yes
1888,This incident occured in late July early August 2000 My wife had been fishing with me on a couple of occasions earlier that season   but was wanting to go where the weeds werent so high  I had found a place that was popular for folks that like to catfish .We arrived there at about 3 pm   to set up our gear before nightfall.originally we planned to stay till midnight if the fishing was good  we had brought coffee and snacks   enjoying the chance to be out together  she kept me fairly busy baiting her hooks and re-rigging her line  We had a couple bites   lost some hooks etc. It was pitch dark at about 9 30  but the lanterns kept the area well lit almost back to our pick-up it was parked back behind us about 75 or 100 ft. at the top of the boat ramp. The noise started behind us to the left  it was rustling sound that became a loud snapping and cracking that seemed to come closer  there was a thumping sound as well this lasted maybe a couple of minutes   we stood there looking in the area expecting someone to come out into the light.My wife was visibly shaken  but I re-assured her  it was probably a deer .I hoped to re-assure myself as well encouraging her to get her line back in the water  I kept glancing back in that direction cause I knew we werent alone out there now  as we recast our lines something ran across the gravel road behind us the gravel scattered under its weight into the tree line along the side of my pick-up  as it went along side  whatever it was  slapped   the truck bed  three times quickly   then there was cracking and breaking of limbs on that side of the woods.The lanterns were glowing on the underside of the branches above as they shook and swayed the  thumping  was its feet on the ground i felt it. We both had already dropped our poles   My pistol was hammer back and aimed that direction   my wife was behind me holding onto my belt loops we were ready to go  but afraid to go toward the truck something was over there !  that aint no deer   she said  thats somebody  We stood there for a couple of minutes (seemed like a hour)I felt it was right there watching us ! When we did get to the pick-up I opened drivers door so fast it broke the retaining spring on the hinge  I put her in and locked the door  wanted to see if there were dents in the side of bed I walked around to the dark side of the truck with my flashlight (the feeling of being watched at a disadvantage was overwhelming )when my wife started the engine ....I thought my heart stopped ! After I stumbled back around to the drivers side I turned on all of the lights (even the interior) swung around  backed down to where the gear was . got up enough nerve to get out and reel in the lines and gather up the stuff   while loading I felt as though I was about to be  approached   by something .I was scared ...And then when it screamed  I did too!It sounded loud and close   the sound echoed out into the deep woods  it was unearthly high pitched short but it had a lot of emphasis if it meant to hurry us along..... It worked ! we left there fast ! When we arrived home we told our sons about what had happened because they had occasionally went there to fish as well..Lately we have heard other stories from this area as well theres something out there ..

1889,I am from Madisonville KY. Last year I took my then   8yr old daughter hunting during late youth weekend. The place where we went is some where my and my husband have been going for years. So we went in the woods got set up and as we were waiting  right at daybreak we heard a sound that I have never heard. The best way I can explain is it was like a howl and yell and growl altogether. It would hold a constant yell for about 30secs  we heard it 3x. between the Howls yell growl noise the coyote  s would howl. But I KNOW that was not a coyote we heard. I tried not to let my daughter know that it scared me but she was ready to go after we heard that. I watch your all  s show  Finding Bigfoot  and some of the sounds ya  ll have recorded made my hair stand. I don  t know if it was a Big Foot  but I  m not sure it wasn  t either. ,The location is an old Hopkins County Coal location. Specific directions omitted upon the witness   request. ,Hopkins,6,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21107,no
1890,It was about 9 or 10 feet tall  it was so big it covered the entire window.  The window was long and narrow and about 4 feet from the ground. I  m guessing the hair was about 3 inches long and the color looked like copper in the bright light. The pictures you have on this site looks just like the one I saw except the face. The face of the one I saw was covered with hair and the eyes were big and round. It had brown eyes.  The lips were not big and thick  they were thin compared to the pictures.  The nose I didn  t notice maybe the hair covered it or I don  t remember it anyway.  I mostly remember the eyes. It never showed it  s teeth or made any kind of facial expression.  I didn  t scream or do anything myself but look into it  s eyes. I wasn  t afraid of it  infact I have always thought that it didn  t want to scare me away. I felt sorry for it  for some unknown reason I felt it was a female that had lost it  s young. It had made it  s home under my back lawn.  There must have been a mine or cave on the other side of the hill that lead back under the lawn.  There were houses close beside my house and none of the nieghbors saw it. I think that they are a very curious animal. I will end this with the fact that I would be afraid of it now. ,I  m sorry I don  t remember the name of the road  but it  s the main road between the school and a place called Wolfpen Hollow. The house set between a house owned by a family known as XXXXX and a XX XXX XXXXXXX on the other side. There was a rail road track across the street. The XXXXX family I think bought the house where this happened but she passed away about 10 years ago. now I don  t know who owns it. I move back to Ky in hopes that I might get it back. but it  s only a dream. ,Johnson,10,Kentucky ,KY,Unknown ,21115,yes
1891,In 2005 while fourwheeling with my girlfriend in some bottomland near where I live I was following the laurel river as it snakes its way through these dense bottoms. it was getting dusk dark and we where on the left side of the river as we were riding we had met about 6 deer that were on our side of the river and we sat and watched them with out turning off the fourwheeler. I was carring my sony hi8 camcorder because i have seen bigfoot before but it had been awhile. i also had my .44 magnum pistol on me for we have lots of wildlife around hear and i would rather be safe than sorry. well as we continued our ride we came to a bend in the creek and the tree frogs and crickets were so loud that they about drowned out the atvs engine roar. so i turned it off so we could hear them better because the sound was just really nice and soothing. as we sat and listened i caught a movement out of the corner of my right eye across the river. now first i must tell you that the woods across the river had been logged about 2 years prior so it had a second growth of timber and the animal that i saw was about 75 yards away. anyway i saw a movement out of my right eye so i turned to see an animal which looked like a gorilla for it was on its all fours but was the color of an orangutan for an orangish/red and when it turned its head to look at me its face which i saw pretty well was white much like that of a skull. my girlfriend was looking the other way when i jumped off the atv to film this creature. the creature moved quickly to the base of a downed tree top which it was in front of and just climbed right over onto the otherside where i lost sight of it. my camera was around my neck so i poped off my lens cap cover and started filming in which all i got was a short video of the main branch of the tree shaking where it had just went over. this all took place in just a few seconds possibly 12-15 seconds. i was very disappointed as im sure anyone who looks for these creatures would be. i have alot of other reaports from around hear that i will post as soon as i can and i also have gamecameras in the woods at all times hoping that maybe one day he will run by it. thanks for your time . wes i. ,hwy 229 to 830 to 1189 ,Laurel,2,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21125,no
1892,A few years ago my cousin and I were outside and heard very loud noises  I  ve hunted  camped  all my life. I have heard many animal calls  I  ve heard them all. These noises were very loud  and highpitched. Until recently I  ve always wondered what these noises were. I was watching A&E In Search Of  Bigfoot  they were audio taping trails where bigfoot was sighted. I was shocked when they played these tapes. They sounded exactly the same. An experience like this will really wake you up. This is no bull  people laugh  make jokes but its true. We did not find anything  it was dark and hard to tell in what direction the noise was coming from. We Looked around the next day and didn  t find any sign on the ground or on the trees. Its not a mystery to me anymore  I know the truth. , ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21127,no
1893,A few years ago.Me and my wife was going ginseng hunting.Back in the woods behind our home.It was starting to get warm out the sun was up.We started over the hill top.And the under brush started to get thicker.but we went on.my wife started looking down in this wash out (ditch) I was going along the top of this wash out.(the wash out or ditch mind you was about 12 foot deep and about 20 wide and goes all the way down this hill about 300 feet)We were just going along looking.I heard some noises coming from across the ditch.about 20 to 30 feet away.I tought it might have been a deer or something .I kept on looking in the way the noise was coming.The noise was trees and brush slapping togehter.I seen some brush moving around.then it stop.I was looking trying to see what was making the noises.thats when it came into my view.there was.this thing with redish brown hair.alover at least the parts I seen.I only seen from the chest up.I was only 20 - 30 feet away from it I could see its dark eyes face everything.It looked like a man to me.My wife was still down in the wash out.I could see her.I watch this thing.look down at her then back at me.I had a loaded.22 rifle with me but I could not bring the gun up.It watch us for a few minutes.then I got up enough nerve.To tell my wife to head back up the hill.We was only there about 20 minutes she ask me why are we leaving so fast?.I told her to just get up the hill.But go slow .I didnt know if it would come after us.If we took off running.I watched as she went up the hill.I was walking backwards.Trying to see where it was.and what is was doing.i seen its chest thru the brush As we headed up the hill.thats when my wife seen it to.She started to run.But I got her to stop.We made it home.We have had dogs missing.Only to find them later on tore apart.There insides tore out.This pass deer season (2004).I was back behind my house.hunting I started up the hill.across from where I and my wife seen (Bigfoot).I had a big rock thrown.at me .The rock hit in the top of a big tree.I watched it bounce.off the tree.and hit the ground .I put up my gun looking thru my scope I couldnt seen anything.It was cold on this day , ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21127,yes
1894,While looking through reports for Kentucky I came across report #11966 in Lawrence county  KY. I had a sighting/experience around the same time period and same area near Blaine  KY. I have never told anyone of this other than at the time it happened I told my wife I had been stalked out of the woods by something large and packed my family up  leaving the area. In 2003 my wife and I took our daughter and youngest son with our travel trailer to camp at Yatesville Lake State Park in Lawrence county Ky near Blaine. We arrived on a Friday in August with intent of fishing and I always go on ginseng hunts where I am able/allowed. I think it be noted I am an avid outdoorsman having hunted  fished  hiked  and camped in at least 28 states of the USA for 40+ years. I am well acquainted with big game animals including bears  mountain lions  elk  deer  and wild hogs. I stake my reputation on my word and kept this encounter to myself. On Saturday morning I took my family to fish in the lake at a spot where Highway 32 bridge crosses a fork of Blaine Creek. After my family was set up  I took off into the mountain on the southwest side of this bridge and possibly part of Yatesville Lake WMA to hunt ginseng. As I had worked my way up a long deep hollow and neared the top of the ridge and to my left I heard knocking like someone striking a piece of wood against a tree (similar to what researchers hear/do). I also had several rocks come through the trees from the top of a small cliff at the top of the ridge  but thought they had fell off the rock formations on their own. Then as I happened to look back behind me from the hollow I came out of on the far side of that ridge I saw a very large dark hair covered figure that was watching me and it was standing upright  it definately was not a bear. I estimated later it was near 8   tall  I  m also a carpenter and pretty good at measurements. As silly as it sounds  when it left my sight  I spoke aloud to this  thing  and said  Old one I mean no harm and I  m only taking what I need  all the while easing my way around and down toward my family  once I was out of eyesight I took off down the mountain as fast as I could  I could hear this  bigfoot  following at a distance. Once I got to my family I told my wife to get everything to gather and packed my family out of the area telling them a bear was stalking me off the mountain. It was not a bear and I guess I  m only reporting this now because of the other sightings in the area around the same time. BFRO is welcome to contact me and I would be willing to travel back to the exact spot and show where this occurred even though it was over 8 years ago.  , ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21127,yes
1895,I was deer hunting  watching a clearing between two thickets. It was between 7 30 and 8 00 in the morning in November  the temperature was below freezing and there was a thin layer of snow on the ground. The thickets were cedar thickets. I was sitting on an old road  in the head of the hollow  about a hundred yards from the trail crossing the clearing. The clearing was about 50 or 60 yards across. I heard  from the top of the thicket to my left  crashing  brush and limbs breaking  very loudly  like large limbs. It lasted maybe ten seconds or so. About five minutes later  I heard the same noise  maybe fifty or seventy five feet down the hill in the direction of the clearing. Brush and limbs thrashing  breaking  hitting together. Then about five minutes later  the same noise closer down the hill. The last time  it happened about 20 yards into the thicket from the clearing. Then  out of the thicket stepped something  walking on two legs  black from head to toe  with it  s arms swinging by it  s sides it walked across the clearing in probably no more than five or six seconds. I was too scared to move  but I took my gun and eased out of there  too busy watching the clearing to really look for tracks  but the grass was so thick I couldn  t have seen any anyway. When I got to the truck  I waited on my hunting partner  worried that something might have happened to him  I walked partway back into the area and met him coming out  he asked if I had seen a large pile of feces in the road through the clearing on my way out. I had walked down that road about 30 minutes earlier and it wasn  t there then. He said it was in the area where I saw this thing cross. He described the feces as loose  with grass and long  black hairs in it. I then told him what I saw and he said he was sure it was a bear and my imagination added to it. He never did believe me and no one else has  either. But it  s true  I am a minister and have no reason to lie. ,About four miles from Blaine. I can  t remember the road number  but I could take someone back to the exact spot. ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21127,yes
1896,I live in the very wooded hills of eastern kentucky. I noticed that some of my garbage behind my house had been ripped up  not reallly chewed up. Then one night about 2a.m. I let my dog out for the night and I saw him looking up the hollow(which is a very deep valley with a creek at bottom and about 4-5 caves surround the area). About 5 minutes later i heard him barking loudly like at something and i could tell  I went to the door and yelled for him to get back here thats when i heard him skuffle with something. I could not see him but  then suddenly he came running back fast and ran in the door. I then called my dad which lives right beside me and told him to bring his light and his gun something was outback trying fight the dogs. We started to walk up the hollow and heard really loud crashing and breaking of good size limbs  and also heard a grunting sound a couple time. They move for about 30 seconds very loudy breaking everything it sounded like  I heard alot of animal run in the woods but not any that just run right through the trees most animals will dodge the brush. We held the light up on the hill about 100 feet away for awhile all we heard was one constant sounds in the leaves right in front of us as something else walked around to the right of us. We left right after that because we didnt really hear anything anymore. The next day me and my dad decided that we was going to go look to see how the brush was broke or any kind of sign of what we were dealing with because we have had a big history of dogs just disappearing without a trace  and i have 3 dogs now so i want to protect them from whatever i thought it was. We walked all over the hill only finding spots where it seemed like something was bedding. As we were walking off we decided to walk down an old logging path off the hill  about half down my dad says whats that there and I look and see what looks like a really big human foot print  but like really big with a prominate heel and toes with a arch in the middle of the print. We both looked at it and looked at each other we both knew it looked like no animal track we had ever seen before and we are avid outdoorsmen. We came back down off the hill amazed by what we had found. So I got on the internet that night looking at some bigfoot stuff  i had watch some already and i believed in bigfoot but never really thought i would experience it in my own back yard. So I looked up some stuff and saw that some people had heard a banging stick sound. The next day which was April 15 2010  I went back to the footprint to take pictures  which i have and would love to share. I took the pictures and decided to start banging some sticks together to see if i could call something out. I did it for probably about 10 minutes and was about to stopped i was gonna do it 2 more times. I hit it again and right after i did I heard a loud really high pitch scream/roar that sounds just like the recording that was caught in Ohio in 1994. It scared me so bad I turned and ran a fast as i could down a really steep hill running through briars and everything  i thought i was running for my life. I made it all the way back to the house i had never been that scared in my life. Ive heard almost every animal before even a bobcat and I have no clue what made that sound. I didnt even take time to look back even though i wanted to try to attract it to snap a picture. I am definately a firm believer now and I think if someone could come investigate pretty quick it may still be hanging around. I am going to continue to try to lure it out and try to get a good clear picture( if i dont run again lol) I also have the pictures of the print that i would love to share. ,West from louisa  in a area called fallsburg. ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Spring ,21127,no
1897,On my way from Louisa to Blaine  just before the Rich Creek boat ramp. I looked to my left to look at some horses that stay on this hill and I noticed two pine trees that I never seen before (which I thought to be pine trees). I told the person with me that I  d never seen pine trees in that spot before  she stated she had not either. No horses were around. But the next day we came by this same spot....NO PINE TREES...Whatever they were  one was standing  one was down on its knees  backs toward us  next to a big tree  color was a dark color from dark brown to a lighter brown to tips of blonde. The one standing was very large  tall and thick head came to a point. No neck that I could see. The one kneeling or on its knees  was the same almost in color  same shape in head  but didn  t seem as wide at the shoulders. ,If you go west on Hwy. 32 from Louisa KY. You will go by the Yatesville Lake  cross the Adams Hill  then drop down into Rich Creek. There is a church on the right. The sighting was on the left. You go on not even a mile is the Rich Creek boat ramp. ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21127,yes
1898,I would like to talk to you guys because a lot of other stuff has been occurring around my farm. A few months ago something screamed at me and then went who  who  like an owl. I looked up the scream on the web and the thing it sounded most like was a cougar  but the owl sound was not an owl. Other things that happens is rocks being thrown when I  m in garden  or at night when I get home and sit on back porch. Once when I was cutting fire wood at dusk and was loading wood something or someone threw a lot of rocks and made a ruckus. Also at night when I get home I sit on back porch to play with my dogs something hits the side of an old outhouse along with the rock throwing and screams. This happens most nights of the week. I  ve never seen anything but the day after the scream and owl call I went to where it sounded like it came from and found one track in an old rotten log. It looked like a person was barefoot and the track was the ball of the foot and the toes was showing but rain washed some of it away. Also this weekend I went to check out my treestands and beside one was a tree with big branches piled around it in a way that doesn  t look natural to me. Like I said I live on a 200 acre farm and my closest neighbor is a mile away. and I hear stuff and things get tossed off of hillsides night and day. , ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21127,no
1899,This is a follow-up report. It is about the 50 lb. dog food a week  and the x tree marker I found by my deer stand in early fall of 2015. First the dog food. I moved my game cam to see if I can figure out why so much dog food is has been missing. No surprise there. Just pics of me and the dogs. What is surprising is I haven  t had to buy any dog food for around three weeks! Again this is down from a 50 lb. dog food bag a week to a 50 lb. bag bought over three weeks ago and the only thing changed is the camera. The other thing is what some call a tree marker. I found this in early Oct. When I went to check on my deer stands. It is made out of two large branches that cross to make a x shape. It also has a twig in the middle that is y shaped upside down. One end of the big branches is stuck in the roots of one tree and the other end is supported by the branch of another tree. The other branch that makes the x has one end stuck in the ground and the other in a branch on another tree (the one with first branch stuck in roots) with a smaller branch put in to hold it. When I first found the x marker the leaves had started falling and I found three of different colors and put them on center twig half way down the y. The next week they was gone. Ok no big deal. Before leaving I put an apple in the crook of the tree the x was on out of reach of deer and placed three more leaves on the y twig  made sure they would stay by breaking the y  s end. The next week I went back and no leaves and apple is gone. Maybe some other critter got the apple  I don  t know  My game cam is still on dog food. Anyway I left another apple a jar of pb and tied on a piece of blaze orange string on the x. This time a couple of weeks go by and some friends and I go riding and I asked if they would want to see the x. It was night  we rode to the x  apple was there but the peanut butter was missing. We looked around and couldn  t find it. I said look for tracks  none found  so we checked out the x and my friend found a hair on the x marker. We went back home and she pulled the hair out of her pocket so we could check it out. It is an inch long and curly but the weird thing is its clear looking. I still have it and pics of the x marker  however what gets me is when I went hunting on the 21st of Nov. I went to the stand by the x marker (10 ft away) and the jar of peanut butter was on my stand with the lid on it and 2/3 missing!! I am the type that has to see or have real good proof of bf before I believe. However a lot of strange stuff has been going on around here and I wanted to share. , ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21127,yes
1900,Weâ€™ve had several noises occurring over the past month.  Some loggers just started cutting on the property next to us.  So I think has made them angry and it seems that they are mad at us.  We didnâ€™t own the property. We are not people who want the trees cut down.  But here lately weâ€™ve had knocking on trees  slapping the side of our house footsteps and growling right outside our house.  When I walked down my driveway I heard what sounded like a stick being hit against a tree trunk.  Heard running around my house late at night. ,Bells Trace Road ,Lawrence,24,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21127,no
1901,Me and another person was walking up a hollow below a hollowfill. The area was very marshy as beavers have been damming up the streams. We came upon an area where the stream split in two. There was a large rock on the  island  and next to it we found an odd looking impression in the mud. It was approximately 14 inches in length and roughly twice as wide as my steel toe boot. I have three photographs of it. One photo shows my boot next to it. I  m not sure if what I saw is anything. But the photos clearly show what looks to me like toes but I could just be wanting to see more than what is actually there. If you want copies of the photos  let me know. , ,Letcher,2,Kentucky ,KY,Spring ,21133,yes

1903,Unidentified Intruder or Unexplained Hominid Witness  J.L.Tumey Location  Fairview  Kentucky (Fleming County) Investigators  Ron Schaffner (Ron@bfro.net)  John Dailey and Doug McGill Case Data  Mr. Tumey was sitting home watching the baseball game when he heard a strange noise originating from the back porch. Thinking that a prowler was present  he retrieved his pistol and went around back to investigate. He saw what looked like a large dark man-like entity running towards the woods. he fired shots at it  then ran back to his trailer for more bullets. He then saw it again by an old stable. He fired at it again  but missed. Tumey discovered that the freezer on the back porch had been broken into and some frozen chicken was removed and scattered outside. He also found some unusual white hair and impressions on the ground. Tumey told the Flemingsburg  TIMES DEMOCRAT    It was very dark  so I really could not tell exactly what it was. It stood up like a man  but it was so dark  about all I could see was a huge shadow. It made a thumping noise as it ran away.  Mrs. Tumey arrived home and when her husband told her what had happened  she immediately called Sheriff G.W. White. Deputies arrived along with a group of locals who had heard the complaint on police scanners. The entire group searched the area until 3 00 AM  when the deputies found the scattered meat. The next day  more tracks were discovered by a gully. Evidence indicated that something had slid down the embankment. Other prints were found in wet sand and were estimated to be between 12 and 14 inches in length and 6 inches wide. Unfortunately  the prints were not clear enough to establish whether it was a man  s print. More soft evidence was discovered  as Tumey found long white hairs on the door knob of the freezer. Conclusions  Evidence indicates that something entered the back porch and robbed the freezer of chicken  hot dogs and bread. Tumey  s reputation is without question  just as Charles Fulton. Let us for a moment believe it was a prowler  rather than a hairy hominid. Police reports show that they were receiving calls about a strange blonde haired man seen roaming about over the past few weeks. The white hairs found at the sight were forwarded to the Kentucky State Police for analysis by the crime lab. A week later  the results were back and it was determined that the hair was of human origin. The state police concluded that the hair was light brown  blonde and white - from a Caucasian. Mr. McGill learned from the local police that they possibly had a subject in mind. There was a white male  who was a former mental patient who had been seen by others in the area. This man was described as having long blonde hair and a beard. However  this is circumstantial and to the best of our knowledge  nobody was ever charged. In a later interview  McGill told us he was not convinced that the subject seen at Tumey  s was a human. Sheriff White told him that they discovered the remains of packaged meat and bread that had been ripped open and consumed in a frozen state. The Sheriff said that if the meat had thawed  there would have been signs of blood. No blood was found. Hair analysis can be inconclusive and it does take longer than one week to fully complete the comparison testings. The prints could have been weathered. Eating frozen meat is not a human tendency  so this case is still up in the air  although the evidence does weigh towards the prowler theory. However  Mr. McGill feels that there is an unknown creature roaming the area based upon the information he has uncovered.

1904,My husband and I are visiting family in Sandy Hook. On the evening of the 18th  at about 7 30  we got in the car to make a quick run to Sandy Hook. It was very cold  (it was already dark as well)  so he started up the car to let it warm before we took off. As we were waiting  he called his grandmother -- because of the call time on his phone  we know what time this all occurred. While he was talking to her  his low fuel light came on  and they wrapped up the call at 7 45. We pulled out of the driveway and headed down the road. He was going a little faster than normal because we were a little nervous we  d run out of gas if we dilly-dallied too much. As we got into the curve about a quarter of a mile from my mom  s house  I spotted something in the hollow ahead of us. It was almost out of the range of his headlights  and by my calculations  about 75-100 feet away from us. Now this all happened very very quickly  but because I am observant  especially when it comes to spotting deer crossing the road  I was able to make this observation within a couple of seconds. What I saw first was presumably an animal standing on the edge of the opposite lane. I leaned forward and scrutinized closer. Just before I could scream out   DEER IN THE ROAD!  the creature began to walk very quickly  and at that moment I realized it had two legs  not four. At some point I started screaming   Turn on your brights! There  s something in the road!  All the while  I  m looking at this thing which is very big in stature  thick legs  thick abdomen  and (again by my calculations) at least 7 ft tall. It was the color of a tree  specifically the trees in that area  so like a grayish-brown  very earthy-tone. The area where I assume a face would be was lighter in color  but I couldn  t tell what color. I know this because it turned its head and looked straight at our car. My husband saw movement and he saw what he described as a strange shadow  but he did not see the creature. Only I saw the creature  and in fairly good detail. Again  it happened so quickly though  I didn  t get to see feet  hands or facial details like eyes and mouth. One thing I thought was interesting was the direction it was coming from. It was coming from a very tall and steep mountain  and when it hurried across the road  it must have gone off a very steep cliff  as that is the only place it could have gone. This cliff drops off onto Pruetts Fork Road  which is also very wooded and secluded. After we came back from our errand  we drove slowly and tried to inspect the area  but came up empty handed. That night  the neighborhood dogs were behaving very strangely  barking and howling all night long. One of them even acted as if he could see something in the distance  and began to growl and stalk before he took off to chase it. It was a very weird night. , ,Elliott,1,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21063,yes
1905,My son and I were heading home and about 100 feet in front of me I saw a dark colored figure in the road. I began to slow down as I got closer because I thought it was a person because it was standing upright walking across the road. As I got closer the figure moved faster across the road.  By the time I got 20 feet away  I saw a very tall figure covered in dark reddish-brown hair jump over the ditch  over a fence and take off through the field. He moved very fast across the field and into the woods.  I panicked and called my father to tell him what I saw and I drove home as fast as I could past the woods.  Two weeks later my dad saw the same type of figure I saw in the same woods at the same time of the day.  My brother told us several months later he saw the same figure in the same woods as well. , ,Daviess,3,Kentucky ,KY,Spring ,21059,yes
1906,The first time my father and I were going up on a ridge to listen for some turkeys  when all of a sudden out of a pine thicket about 900 yards away  we heard something let out this awful noise. At first we were shocked  then scared because we had never heard this sort of noise before. It made this noise two seperate times  and we left and headed home and didnt think anything of it. About three months after that took place my friends and me thought we would drive through the road just to look around  it was about 11 00 p.m. and sort of foggy we were just driving along when my cousin noticed two red eyes on a bank. I thought it was a racoon until the thing blinked and walked acrossed the road in front of us about 100 yds. up the road. The creature walked upright on two legs and stood about 6  10. We locked the doors and drove off as the creature disappeared into a heavily timbered thicket. A year later which was on Aug. 10 of 98  just a day ago   my sisters and two of my friends got in his truck and decided to go look for some deer. We ended up going down the same road where we had seen and the creature the previous year. The girls were riding in the back just talking to each other when my youngest screamed out. I turned around just in time to see the figure of something standing about thirty yards behind the truck. I grabbed the spotlight and swung it around only to find that the thing had disappeared into the woods. , ,Crittenden,4,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21055,yes
1907,This might be a little late to report but at the time and considering our ages people didn  t believe us. So it was forgotten until I started to check out some Bigfoot info once I moved to Seattle Washington. Anyways here is what happen that warm summer day as best as I can remember. It was a warm sunny summer day and we have been playing in the woods much of the day. In fact J. (the oldest of us five brothers) had made a path doen the hill and had just riden his bike (without brakes) down the hill and hit some rock and had flipped over the handle bars. It was also a place that we use to play cowboy and indians. It was geeting late in the evening  around 7-8 PM. My brother D. was the last one to leave the wood that day when he came running back screaming that he had just seen a hairy monster. When we all went back there we could see nothing but there was a strange smell in the air that stunk and we thought that a animal had died and started to rot so played it off like he didn  t see anything. That night he drew a picture of what he saw and it looked just like some of the drawings of bigfoot that I have seen as of today. Anyways us boys all went down to where he said he seen the thing and we notice large footprints just noticable to the eye because it was so dry but there was a little spring running in the middle of the woods and there where some soft ground that the footprints where made in. They looked just like a human footprint but very big. We all tried to get our Mother and Step-Father to come down and look at them but they just thought we where being kids. Still this day my brother swears he saw Bigfoot that day and I do believe him. At the time of the sightings our ages where     12   9   8   6  and  4. As you can see that we all where very young and the one who saw it was only 6 at the time so you see why no one believed us at the time. I still remember that day like it was yesterday because of the fright in my brothers eyes when he came out of the woods that day. Like I said this is very old but my brother who was 6 at the time still remembers it. I still remember seeing the footprints swallowing my barefoot when I place it in it. You can use this if you want or just disregard it. Again thanks for you time and this was not a hoax.

1908,When I was young six years old  Ronnie Joe a friend of mine and myself was playing behind Ronnie  s house.  We heard a thumbing sound and moved closer to see what was making the sound.  Just behind a neighbor  s house we saw a big foot digging in the ground with a stick of fire wood  at times taking one stick of fire wood and pounding a second stick into the ground. Then he would turn the dirt over  using the stick like a spade. He may have been looking for food  but we never knew for sure. Then the bigfoot stood up and walked our way.  We were only 25ft. to 30ft. from the animal. It was showing its teeth but didn  t make a sound.  This was a open field  bright sunshine lit day  nothing between us and the animal  so we got a good look but not a very long look at bigfoot. The animal had a dark brown coat with a lighter  almost grey vest.  He had large teeth and long  dirty  finger and toe nails. The nails looked very thick. , ,Casey,1,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21045,no
1909,This was about 1980-1983  I lived in Carter County in a small community named Rush. I lived in a small hollow with a partically graveled lane that dead ended at my driveway. The land is hills with pine oak and other common eastern Kentucky trees and brush growth. Land has strip mines with several ponds scattered through it  there are houses  and small farms  (just family type farms).  In 1980 we - my wife and 5 children - moved to the undeveloped 50 + acres. That was my wife  s father  s until his death in 1973. We had lived there for about two or three months when I started hearing things that made me a little uncomfortable but not frightened. There were nights the dogs would bark and carry on but would not go after what ever it was they were barking at.  And we would even run and hide when it would come to close to the house. I asked a couple of the neighbors and they would not discuss it saying it is just a deer or a bear.  Yes there were deer and even a bear killed within a mile or so of the area  but any type of hunter would know that this was very unlikely  but not impossible. I hunted and walked in the woods a lot just to enjoy the cooler tempatures of the forest and to just be out alone. While I was hunting I noticed a few things that wasn  t what I call natural forest happenings (for lack of a better word). I had not heard of markers of bigfoot territory but I saw what I thought was the work of a few of the local boys out in the woods playing. But as I looked at the three large trees that was leaned on another tree to form a teepee structure without a covering  the question always came to mind   Why would anyone want to drag those trees up to here and lean them on that tree?  You could see they were not a natural fall or a accident  It was a diliberate structure that was constructed by someone. There was also small trees  that were twisted almost in two at from four to six feet off the ground.  These were not caused by the wind but by using two hands to twist as you would wring out a cloth. I never saw any footprints but once when the dogs were acting up at something in the woods  and just about twenty yards up the hill  I went after it with a 30 30 rifle. It was about 11 00 at night  it was probably in early winter or late fall  there was a skift of snow on the ground  mostly in spots on the hill.  After I walked around the hills for about a mile to a mile and a half not getting any closer or able to see what I was after even though it stayed about twenty or thirty yards ahead of me.  I could never see it  but I could hear it walking in the leaves and breaking branches. I decided to just go on to the house.  The next morning I walked up on the hill to see what kind of tracks I could see. I found my tracks in the snow and where I had tripped a couple of times on vines growing in the leaves on the ground. But I could not find any indication of anything that was walking in front of me or any place around me. I have seen eyes that looked blood red  and another time green  as they were looking at me from the low underbrush at night.  While setting on the porch at night I would hear what at the time I thought sounded a little like an old steam locomotive whistle. But not guite the same they were always a long way off in the hills. My wife at the time (now divorced) saw what she  described as an old Indian men looking through the window at her.  I was not there at the time  but she did call the Kentucky state police.  There were no foot prints so they said she probably saw her own reflection and I guess just dissmised it. She said she saw it from the mid chest up. The bottom of the window is at least six feet six inches off the ground  I  am six feet and I had to use an 8 inch block to see over the bottom edge of the window. One night we were leaving to go into Ashland. As we were getting into the truck we heard someone on the hill whistling  I called out to see who it was but there was no reply  just more whistling.  I told them I had a gun and would shoot if they did  nt answer.  There was no answer  and I fired a shot in the general direction and the whistling stopped.  But there was no reply.  It just started to walk around the hill  I fired another shot in the air but it did not speed up or slow down. I got in the truck and we left. I never had a sighting but all these things and a few more such as throwing of rocks and pieces of wood  has convinced me there is something that is intelligent enough to stay so close and still so undetected is living within our back yards.  These things happened in the early eightys and the place has changed  but I think it is still alive and healthy. The Greenup County sighting prompted me to send this to you as that was just a few miles over the hills. Hope this information will be helpful to you. ,Six miles east of Greyson  Kentucky and about twenty miles west of Ashland Kentucky.  ,Carter,4,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21043,yes
1910,On Jan 14th  2010   I was taking my son to school on Hwy. 36  outside of Sanders. We were following a Ford Ranger and were probably 30-40 foot behind it. I noticed something run quickly in front of that truck. I did not see the thing run from the opposite side of the road  though obviously thatâ€™s where it came from. I noticed it when it was right in the middle of the road. Iâ€™m guessing that the truck is between 5â€™ and 6â€™ tall. From my view  behind the truck  I could still see about 1â€™ of the thing over the top of the cab before it came back into full view and went up into the woods that run right by the road. During the second or two that it came back into full view after crossing in front of the truck  I was able to see itâ€™s silhouette fully in the headlights from the truck. It was on two legs  dark in color  wide (depth of the body  from back to chest-I donâ€™t mean the broadness of the shoulders as I saw it from the side)  large legs and very tall. Because of itâ€™s position and it being dark out  I was not able to see the face or front of it.  Iâ€™m not able to give any description of  the fur or hair that was covering it either. I wish I could tell you that I saw a Bigfoot. Since I canâ€™t say that for sure  I will tell you what I did NOT see  for sure. I did not see a deer  elk  bear or man. The truck in front of me hit his breaks during my sighting so there is no doubt to me that he saw it as well. I should tell you that this thing crossed closely in front of him. It wasnâ€™t like it was a great distance in front of him. I wanted to run up and talk to the man in the truck when we got to the end of the road but didnâ€™t because I didnâ€™t want to scare my son (who is already afraid to play outside out house by himself). As soon as this vanished from my sight  my little boy gasped and yelled  â€œDid you see that?â€.  I responded calmly telling him that I had and asked him what he thought it was. He was unsure but said that it was big and quick. I didnâ€™t ask any more questions at that time as I didnâ€™t want to scare him or lead him in any way. I wanted to see what he would say about it after the â€˜shockâ€™ (?) had wore off. I asked him again this morning (Jan. 21st) what he thought it was. He said that he didnâ€™t know. I asked him what size he thought it was and he said medium sized. I told him that I was a little over 5â€™ and told him to guess a size in feet and he said around 5â€™. , ,Carroll,15,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21041,yes
1911,As a small child i grew up in south eastern kentucky. Each winter the creek that ran next to our home would freeze over and we would skate on a area we had built a crude dam on. One morning after the creek had frozen back hard after partly thawing my sister and i went to play on the ice. When we arived we noticed that what apeared to be a small bare footed child had walked across the ice before it had fully frozen. The track had a definite form a heel  front pad and five toes .It had crossed a distance of about twenty feet in six steps went up a steep bank slipped down and went on up the bank. No other prints were ever seen and i have never heard of any other encounters in that area. The print was about eight inchs long and three or four inches wide. ,Turn off highway 15 toward Lost Creek about 8 miles. ,Breathitt,1,Kentucky ,KY,Winter ,21025,no
1912,My son and I was driving home from the emergency room. It was late summer around 2 45 - 3 00 A.M. in the morning . On a black-top county road-two lane. in a very wooded hilly area.I was going about 35 mph. at an instant a extremely tall with it  s back slightly curved foreward  very long arms and legs lanky bodystyle   long hair covery it  s body from head to it  s feet came up from side of the road .One foot hit edge of the blacktop.it took no more than two and 1/2 steps till it was on the other side of the road going into the woods. when i saw itstep out of the woods onto the edge of the blacktop i put on my brakes almost hiting it with my left front of the car .i still wonder to this day if i did not at least brush against it with my car .what was very interesting to me is all the pictures i see of bigfoot does not look like the one i saw . it did not appear as mscular... very loose in motion with it  s top part of it  s curved foreward.it threw it   legs very far in front of it as it took it  s step across the road. Also another concern of the picture i  ve seen of bigfoot... is it  s hair. It  s hair was extremely dark not the length of a ape look but it was longer and very stringy looking. in places i would say guessing  atleast 8 to 12 inches long . This night my son and I will never forget. i have encountered bigfoot in my area several times since then. ,(edited) ,Boyd,1,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21019,yes
1913,I was one of two teenage boys playing near coal mine noticed something standing right at the mouth of the mine. It appeared to be a gray or white looking ape type animal on two legs  with one arm hanging over a wooden cross timber  which would be about 8-9 feet tall. They ran to tell parents but when they got back it was gone. I was born in Cary and never saw anything like what I saw there that day with a neighbor boy. It was in the afternoon when the other boy and I was playing near a slate dump on the side of a hill  when we walked up the hill toward the mouth of the coal mine we both saw the same thing at the same time. The thing scared us to death . We looked at it several times it watched us and we watched it. Its arm moving back and forth across the wooden timber. No mistake what ever it was  was alive!!!!!! We may have been young but we both know what we saw   that day and I still remember like it happened yesterday. ,Cary  Kentucky. Highway 66 ,Bell,2,Kentucky ,KY,Unknown ,21013,yes
1914,My family and I (my wife and two daughters  aged 10 and 15) were vacationing in Mammoth Cave State Park (Diamond Resort specifically) from June 27 - July 1  2003.  We had a cabin situated on a golf course at the resort.  We were in the area that was furthest from the pool  clubhouse  tennis courts and all other facilities.  We were in a condominium and at the time were the only family staying there.  Just after sunset  while still dusk (Astronomical twilight would be the most accurate term)  I heard a load scream.  At first  I dismissed it as a Coyote  but then I heard it again.  After this vocalization  I realized that every other sound had discontinued - no crickets  birds  dogs - nothing.  It was absolutely silent.  Being a curator for the BFRO since 1998  my interest was understandably piqued.  The third vocalization was absolutely unmistakeable - the nearest human counterpart would be that of a women being brutalized and screaming as a result.  I immediately contacted Matt Moneymaker by cell phone to see if we could hear it again  but that was the last time.  It was very difficult given the terrain to determine distance or even location.  After the incident  I personally yelled and heard echos from nearly every direction.  Other than my sighting at the age of 9  this is the only other experience that I have had.  There is no question in my mind that this was a Sasquatch.  Why he/she was vocalizing is anyone  s guess! ,Diamond Resort with the Mammoth Cave State Park System in Kentucky. ,Barren,1,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21009,no
1915,My sister and I  while traveling home through Wickliffe bottoms in Kentucky at night (apx. 2 30 am)  observed a large object on the side of the road.  As the headlights shined on the object and it became closer  we were both stunned at what we saw before us.  My sister was driving and I was in the passenger seat. The creature was on my side and as the car passed it  I couldn  t have been more than 2 to 3 feet from it  s body. There was a large manlike creature with long  shiny dark hair covering it  s entire body. With very distinctive muscle tone definition in it  s legs and arms  this thing looked very strong.  It  s face was what startled me the most because it had human like features especially the eyes..not like any animals   eyes i  d ever seen before (and I  ve been a hunter all of my life).  It was at least 8 foot tall because as we passed it  it  s upper torso towered well above the top of the vechicle which was a Ford Escort.  The creature was standing half in the ditch and half on the road as if it was trying to cross.  And when it looked at us  it  s eyes followed us as we passed.  At this point  my sister and I remained silent for at least 3 to 4 minutes after we first laid eyes upon it  as if we were seeing something we shouldn  t be seeing. Then I looked at my sister and she looked at me  simutaneously we said  What the hell was that? .  As we got home  we spoke about it for the next 15 or 20 miles and decided how rediculous this must sound but we had thought we had just witnessed the wolfman.  But make no mistake  it had the face of a man covered with hair  not the snout of a wolf.  It was a frightening experience  yet an intriguing one that my sister and I will never forget and still talk about to this day. ,Hwy. 121 heading toward Mayfield KY. Coming out of Wickliffe KY.

1916,The appearance of the thing was just as I have seen on tv stories and descriptions I have heard of.  As far as the behavior of it  it was very shy as it appeared to not want to be seen.  My son and I had been deer hunting on a local farm.  When time came to leave  we met up and started back to my truck. About 50 yards down our path we heard something coming out of a cedar thicket and we both saw it.  It stood app. 8 feet tall and had long brown hair all over it.  We stopped and it stopped at the same time.  We didn  t know what to say or do.  Then it just stepped back into the thicket and went away out of sight.  We got back to my truck as fast as we could  but we could hear something following us the whole time.  But it did stay completly out of sight.  I haven  t told too many people about this  because they always laugh at us or start making jokes.  I know I  ll never forget it as long as I live.  It was really scary.  That thing was huge. ,On Bods Mill Rd. there is a hidden entrance to the old Simms farm. It is 100 acres and is very dense in growth.

1917,My late Grandparents owned a home outside of Scottsville  Kentucky for many years in Allen County.  The area has always been well-known for sightings of the  monkey man  as he is called there throughout this area of Kentucky (Monkey Man Hollow).  The first sightings began back in the old pioneer days.  This story is true because my late Grandmother  an honest woman and Christian  saw one of these  bigfoot  creatures on two seperate occasions both at night time.  I was there during one encounter she had as well.  This creature would come into their front yard at night and lean up or kneel down against a large beech tree in their front yard.  She described the creatures as standing tall and upright  and walking like a man.  Both creatures were covered with white  and somewhat curly  hair all over.  I thought they may be older ones of these creatures because of the white hair.  The creatures just got up and walked away on two feet just like a person would do back into the woods.  Also  a friend and neighbor who lived down the road from them saw a Sasquatch one time leaning against a fence post in his front yard across a road in broad daylight.  He has told this story to lots of people many times  and always the same way.  When his dogs gave chase to the creature  tall and upright like a man with brown hair all over  just leaped over the fence and walked away into the valley below. Although I haven  t seen one of these creatures  I did hear screaming sounds like a woman would make one night when I stayed overnight with them.  It woke us all up.  Trust me  this eerie sound would make your hair stand on end  and this was no ordinary animal sound either.  They always told me that it was just that  thing  that lives in the woods.  Many people throughout the years have seen these creatures all across the Allen County area.  This story is absolutely true and accurate to the best of my ability.  These creatures are real! ,A few miles outside of Scottsville  Kentucky taking the old Glasgow Road until you turn right onto Durham Springs Road.

1918,OK  let me start by saying I have always been fascinated by  Big Foot.   I don  t think it makes me biased because until recently I was always still skeptical but very curious. I recently had a sighting and was looking in the reports provided here to see if there had been many in KY.  I was shocked to see so many in KY and was completely floored when I saw a report not only in my same county but on the abandoned property behind my farm.  The report was from 1993 I think but our first sighting was in 2006. In 2006 my then 4yr old daughter told me that she saw Monkeys at the edge of my field as she was riding in my wifes car down our driveway.  She said There was a big one and a smaller one.  They both had red eyes and the bigger one looked like it was waving.  I asked her how big and she said the biggest one was a lot bigger than me (I  m 6  4  200lbs) and it was real hairy.  I dismissed it as a childs imagination but always kept it in mind because the description matched stories I had heard as a teenager about a big foot type creature in Lawrenceburg known as  Howdy  because he waves. Ive had her retell the story to friends and family over the years and it stays consistant but never much detail. I was actually jealous.  I thought  if she really did see something  why couldn  t I have seen it too so I could know for sure  plus as I stated before  I was always curious.  I kept an extra eye out for a while but never saw anything and pretty much dismissed it. Modern Rifle season  November 2011.  I was deer hunting by myself on the same property (mine) that borders the abandoned ***** ******** mentioned in a previous report.  It was getting close to dusk and I was considering getting out of the deer stand soon when I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to look and  couldnt believe my eyes.  From left to right I watched 2 creatures  both larger than me and covered in long hair  running upright on 2 feet.  There was no mistake these were big foot(s).  One was very dark brown/almost black and the slightly smaller one was almost blonde.  More like coyote colored blonde.  They were both jogging with arms relaxed and looking behind them.  They ran within 25 yards right in front of me!  I honestly cant give much detail about the faces  they were looking behind them alot plus I was simply shocked and not looking for detail.  They covered ground quickly and were gone in less than 10 seconds.  They dissapeared into a clump of trees behind my pond.  I pulled my scope up but could only make out  something   going through the woods once they passed.  I waited until almost dark and got down to look for fur or prints.  I couldnt find anything but it was cold  dark and I was shaking from the shock of seeing them and the cold combined.  I returned the next morning and found no sign. ,Removed at witness   request. ,Anderson,10,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21005,yes

1921,This was years ago  probably 1994 or 95 but I lived in Arbor Glen Estates in Richwood  Kentucky.  Back then it was a relatively new subdivision and our home backed up to a wooded area.  My sighting was in the middle of the day.  I was walking my dog  Charlie in the backyard and all of a sudden she stopped.  I looked around and took note of the fence line right where she was looking and growling.  It was straight in front of us.  The bigfoot was about 50 feet in front of me on the other side of the fence line.  We starred at each other for a few minutes.  I had such a hold on Charlie  s leash.  After a few minutes of looking at one another  he turned an ran away.  As soon as he turned  I turned  grabbed the dog and made a run for the house. I looked back just as I was almost in the house and he was gone. I distinctly remember the creature.  He was tall.  Well over 6ft high.  He was an off white color with with fur that dangled a little bit (maybe 3-5 inches in spots).  The face was a mix between human and primate.  Not an ape  not a human dressed up. My father has also seen it.  Off of Shady Lane in Crittenden  Ky. near a creek bed.  Later that night I overheard him telling my mother about it.  Crazy thing is  we seem to have seen the same type of creature.  Both of our sightings were tall creatures and off white. ,It was Arbor Glen Estates.  Towards the back of the subdivision.

1922,Some friends of ours who live by the Ohio River in Constance  Ky.  have been telling us about a strange  yowling  from some large creature in the woods behind their house. Their description and the sound on the Sightings video tape were quite similar. The women is very familiar with animals and she cannot tell what this animal might be. They have heard the thing  crashing  through the underbrush. To my knowledge  nobody in the area has seen anything or reported footprints  but the woods are on a steep hillside along the river. I have seen coyotes in Northern Kentucky and I know that bobcats  bears  and other large animals appear from time to time  so this could be a false alarm  but I thought you might be interested. ,Along the Ohio River ,Boone,13,Kentucky ,KY,Unknown ,21015,no
1923,I was leaving a freinds house a little after 9 pm on a week night headed home. I was on my motorcycle going east on KY 8 about to come up on a bend in the road. I had lived in this area for about 5 years and had just recently moved. In the years of living in this area and being an avid bow hunter  I have observed lots of deer crossing the road just around this bend. I slowed down because the sun had set not long before and the deer move at that time.  As I came around the bend  I realized there was  something in the road in the oncoming lane. I slowed down futher  it was crossing the road into my lane. I rapidly slowed and swirved left to go behind it. I almost hit it  missed it less than a foot. I stopped about 10 feet past where it crossed in front of me. I quickly turned around in the road and aimed my light on it as it went into the thick brushline next to the road. It was about 36 to 42 inches tall  short legs and long arms  black hair 4 to 5 inches long  walking upright bipedily. ,3/4 of a mile west on KY 8 (aka 3608) from the I-275 petersburg exit in kentucky.

1924,I saw a white colored bipedal animal  it looked to be around or over 7 feet tall  broad shoulders  and thick coarse hair draping off of the creature. Seen at dusk while riding on a fourwheeler trail to check a soybean field for deer. It looked at me and my brother (for what seemed like minutes but probably seconds  staring us in the eyes) overwhelmed with fear I geared down my fourwheeler. Looking down for a second to realize I was in neutral  as i looked back up trembling with fear he was almost out of sight running through the woods away from our direction. Nobody could have played a joke on us  it is private land and nobody knew we were going back there but the landowner that we told right before we drove back there. ,Boston Laffoon Rd off Hwy 54 ,Daviess,3,Kentucky ,KY,Fall ,21059,yes
1925,In June of 2005 my family had a strange occurance.  My son and a couple of his friends wanted to camp out down in the woods.  My husband and one of the other boys   dad went down to check on them before we went to bed.  It was a full moon out and they were sitting down there with the boys when my husband saw something move between the trees.  He wasnt sure what it was and kept watching when he seen it move between the trees again he could see the moonlight between its legs.  They got scared and came up out of the woods.  Of course I didnt beleive him so the next day I went down there and found footprints.  One was a really good one that we actually poured a mold of.  Upon further scouting I found some odd things.  There was a bunch of little pieces of tree bark in a circle and it looked and felt like something might have been chewing on it.  We found moss rolled back  not tore up just rolled back.  And we also found tree limbs stuck in the ground kinda like markers.  Our friends didnt believe us so one nite we got a bunch of us together and went down in the same place my husband first saw it.  I had been interested so I did some research on the internet and took a little hand held recorder and recorded what was suppose to be bigfoot screams.  Around dusky dark my husband started playing the screams on the recorder he played them a few times and then all of a sudden we heard the god awfullest scream we  ve ever heard. It was high pitched and drawn out.  Everyone was shocked.  I dont know what it was but it wasnt too long after that  that a log  about the size of a piece of firewood came down out of the woods and landed by my vehicle.  After everyone got calmed back down we were standing around the fire when I thought I saw something just outside of the fire lite walking toward the creek.  I went and got back in my truck and about 2 minutes later it sounded like it picked up a creek rock and slammed it back down.  We all left after that.  The next weekend it was around midnite when my husband  my son and a couple of friends drove my truck back down there.  Without a fire it was really dark  they had a spotlight and my husbands   friend was just randomly shineing it through the woods when at the same time my husband and another person in the vehicle said   there it is  so he brought the light back to the spot where they seen it  my husband instantly started the truck up and his friend told him to shut it off and when he did they could hear it running through the woods.  They said it was just trashing it way up the hill.  But they saw it when he brought the light back down through the woods  it was behind a tree and they said it had red eyes.  Another odd thing was that all the grass was laid down flat kinda like in swirls.  And there is nothing down there that would lay it down flat.  I  ve seen deer bedding before but this was a large area that was flat by the creek.  We still go back there sometimes and we haven  t seen anything or any signs like we did that year.  Everyone thinks we are crazy which I probably would too if I hadn  t experienced it for myself.  Anyways thanks for taking the time to read this sorry its a few years late but it came up in conversation again and I wanted to share my story. ,Please do not publish location. ,Fleming,2,Kentucky ,KY,Summer ,21069,yes
1985,In September of 1997 while traveling north on route 610 in Worcester county MD. at around 11 00 PM my bother and I saw a figure on the side of the road. It was very large and dark the light did not seem to reflect off of it  honestly it was as if the outline was what caught our eye. Since we were in my Suburban I could tell very easily that what ever we were seeing was tall. I recall that my brother was so shocked he even jumped away from my side of the truck which is where the figure was. Even to this day the thought of what we saw makes my hair stand up. The figure stood motinless facing towards the east it made no movement what so ever. I remember the light that was reflected from it  s eyes was a white/silvery color. Michael and I said very little on the way home that night and we rarely speak of it today. ,The location was on route 610 about 6 or seven mile from route 50 ,Worcester,6,Maryland ,MD,Fall ,24047,yes
1986,In the Summer of 1970  I was taking my pony and dog for a walk in the thickly wooded area where my parents had just built a new house. It was at that time a very isolated area.  We had apparently disturbed the wildlife in the area as we were always seeing very large black snakes and other wildlife near the house.  I was not prepared  however  for the creature I encountered in the woods behind our home.  I looked up on the thickly wooded hill and saw a huge creature that resembled a gorilla or a bear.  It was dark in color and appeared to be hairy.  It was on the other side of an old fence from me.  I was very frightened. I fled the area immediately.  I wish I could describe this creature better.  I really don  t think it was a bear.  Bears are not usually sighted in our area and this creature was really big and it startled me because of it  s size.  I don  t frighten easily and was accustomed to living in the country with wild animals.  The one thing that does amaze m e when I look back on this incident is that my dog and  pony had no reaction to this creature.  It makes me wonder if they had become accustomed to it coming around when we weren  t outside.  I never saw it again but a couple of years later my mother saw something from her kitchen window that looked to her somewhat like a bear but she wasn  t sure as she was not close enough to it to see features.  It was on all fours and it got into the nearby stream and walked around the bend and out of sight.  The area where we had these sightings was in Washington Co. MD.  We live near a stream and a thickly wooded area.  The stream feeds into the Conococheague Creek which then feeds into the Potomac River a few miles from our home.  My parents have lived there for 30 years now and there have been no sightings of any creatures such as the ones we observed in the early 1970  s.  However  we were the first to really disturb that woods and the area is now much more developed. ,The area is about six miles west of Hagerstown  MD in Washington Co. MD.  If you take I-70 west from Hagerstown  MD and get off at the Route 63 exit  you then travel north on Route 63 to US Route 40 and travel west until you get to Cedar Ridge Road which will be on your left.  You take Cedar Ridge Road and about a mile back you take a left onto Kemps Mill Road.  The woods is on your right. ,Washington,54,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24043,yes
1987,I was camping on the largest of the river islands on the ******** River in the extra restricted area of the ****  s Central Tract. It is an old growth forest. The understory was mostly clear of bushes and brush. I would from time to time camp out overnight there. I always camp with nothing more then a sleeping bag on the ground. While on the refuge I would not light fires  not cook food  not play music; just pure silence  meditation and observation. Late on this one evening in late July  I heard wood knocking or clapping in the distance from the south portion of the river. I instantly thought of Bigfoot (I must be honest  especially after all the activity I had observed throughout the months prior). I had a large stick with me  so I slapped it against an old tree. At first I heard no reply. I repeated the banging once every few minutes until I did got a response of knocking back. This was in the same location as before. It then returned to silence until about 15 minutes later when another knocking occurred. About an hour after the wood knocking I heard definite bi-pedal footsteps walking very slowly. The footsteps were obviously coming from something which was being very cautious. The creature was approaching from the south where the wood knocking sounds were coming from. I assumed that it was on the next island downstream (which is separated by a narrow deep channel of water 15 ft across by 6-10 ft deep). I remained silent the whole time as to not scare it off. The next thing I heard was a loud  kerplunk  of something falling or dropping into the water channel. Around 15 minutes later I heard a few faint footsteps walking away back to the south (these steps were not as gentle or cautious as before). It sounded as if it were tired of the game or just leaving because it investigated what I was doing. The rest of the night was silent. Following morning  The next morning I went over to the next island at the break of dawn. I found no obvious footprints or evidence. However  I did find possible large prints but they were not overly revealing. ,General Location  A government operated wildlife research station in a major river drainage which empties into the Chesapeake Bay. The **** was established as a wildlife research refuge in 1936. Prior to 1936  it was a large privately owned family estate (since the 18th century) and partially owned by the defense department in the early 20th century. The refuge area has largely been left untouched and never encroached by development  large scale farming  logging  or citizens. Farming was limited during the 18th century as the family line became very wealthy and used the massive area as a private estate for family members from the 19th century onward. Specific Location  Central Tract (extremely secured  gated and guarded area that is off limits to all citizens that are not employees) This area has been dedicated to bacterial  viral  pesticide  endangered species  natural resources  and migratory bird research for over 50 years. This tract is nationally famous from Rachel Carson  s  Silent Spring  book and the research which uncovered and revealed the extreme dangers of DDT and other pesticides. There are many old small research buildings trickled throughout the center portion of the tract. Surrounding the core of research buildings there are lots of very rare trees (true Chestnut trees  next to genetically modified Chestnut trees) and endangered plants. Beyond this core to the east are many mitigation research ponds and closed areas which breed endangered birds. The majority of the central tract is dense forests  streams  rivers and ponds. ,Prince George  s,2,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24033,no
1988,My friend and I had been searching for a place called Dickerson quarry in Dickerson Md  and had just located it on a map. We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry  it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs  about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry  we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped  whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry  hearing the strange sound several more times  always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though  being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind  Did you throw something in? . He said no  he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think  we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big  that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening  I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind  What the hell is going on?  His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle  a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket. I didnt see if it was a rock or what but it was big. At that point I jumped for it and hit the ground running with my freind right on my tail  neither of us looking back. I have never really felt scared like that  but that day I had the thought that we might meet something that was beyond nature and not live to tell about it. Our journey into the woods took about 30 minutes due to the high growth of pricker bushes  Our journey out took about 3 minutes! We reached the car and the only after the adrenaline wore off did we realize we both were bleeding nicely from running top speed through summer overgrowth. At the time  I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot  but it sounds like a classic case. Ive only been back a few times since then and only in the winter where I can see for 100 yards!! ,Land is owned by the Monocacy Hunting Club. ,Montgomery,38,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24031,yes
1989,We lived in a ranch-style house on an acre of land which backed up to several hundred acres of farm land and forest. My father and grandfather had built a picnic table out of an old electric cable spool  turned on its side. One day we noticed the spool was gone. There was a path leading from our property with a cornfield on one side and forest on the other which led to more deeply forested area. We could see on the path places where the spool had been rolled and places where it had been picked up and carried. Large  human-like footprints were also found on the path. The spool was found about a mile away from the house. It had been tossed into a steep gulley. What impressed us at the time was that this thing had been carried over some pretty rugged terrain  so we didn  t think a bunch of kids would have gone to the trouble. The spool was very heavy - it took three men to move when they originally put it in. The footprints were very large  much larger than my fathers size 10 shoe. ,9922 Windflower Ct  Ellicott City MD 21043 ,Howard,3,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24027,yes
1990,I saw it from close up  about 20 yards or so. It appeared to be about 8 feet tall  and its body was completely covered with brown hair. I saw it for about 2 minutes until it moved off into the woods. It happend at Little Bennett camp site in Frederick  MD  on July 31 at about 6 30 in the evening. It was a massive creature  bigger then any human I  ve ever seen!!! You can contact me at [avail. to BFRO investigators] if you want more information. This isn  t a hoax!!! It looked to be feeding on leaves from the trees. The incident occured at 5 00pm-6 00pm on 7/31/96. ,Frederick  MD. Little Bennett camp ground. ,Montgomery,38,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24031,yes
1991,The sighting was thru the window from the inside of the house. The creature was looking thru the living room window right above the halfway point. Which a person can  t see past the bottom ledge.That is what scared me. It was moonlit and created a shadow. I had just turned off the TV at that time. We have alot of deer but they are not vertical or that tall. The incident lasted three seconds. ,Outside of living room window of single family home. ,Montgomery,38,Maryland ,MD,Winter ,24031,yes
1992,Myself and 2 good friends were camping in the Lill Aaron Strauss Wilderness area of Green Ridge State Park in Allegheny County Maryland. We were all in our late teens but very experienced campers and very comfortable in the woods. On the 2nd night of our trip we made camp in a low area several miles off the trails near where our topographic map showed a Civil War cemetery was located  though we were unable to find the site. After dinner we sat around the fire as the darkness grew and we all began to feel a bit spooked  as if we were being watched  so we let the fire burn itself out and bedded down. Early the next morning I awoke to a loud wailing which I can only describe as a cross between a lion roar and a screech owl. The noise happened several times and it was very close. At the same time we heard something crashing through the vegetation nearby and what sounded like thick branches cracking and heavy thuds as if large logs or rocks were impacting the forest floor. My friend Bryan and I were sleeping in hammocks over which we had suspended rain ponchos. The ponchos were fastened to the hammocks so we would need to untie them in order to get out and we could not see out either. I whispered to Bryan  what was that? . He whispered back  I don  t know . That was all we said. I was scared out of my mind and did not dare even move my head to try to see anything as I didn  t want to draw attention to myself. I was able to look at my watch and determine it was just after 5am. At that moment I resigned myself to my fate  figuring that if something out there wanted me I would have no chance. I made my peace and waited  eventually drifting back off to sleep. Bryan did not sleep at all after the episode and our 3rd friend  Tom  somehow slept through the whole thing. We rose around 6am and broke camp. We looked around for signs of anything unusual but could find nothing. ,We returned to the site the following year and found the cemetery. Our camp was about 100 yards away. I would need to look at the map again to verify the exact location. ,Washington,54,Maryland ,MD,Spring ,24043,no
1993,My mom and I were sitting out on our bottom porch swing below our house while our dog was going to the bathroom. It wasnâ€™t to cold and it was enjoyable to sit out. We sat there for about 10 minutes and then the dog was alerted to something but we couldnâ€™t see it. We think he was alerted to the fox and coyotes that were making a little noise. They normally make more but they werenâ€™t as active. Some of the cows and dogs on the farms surrounding us were making noise like they normally do also. We quit talking and about 2 minutes after that a gut bellowing howl  roar and scream type of sound came from across the street from our house on the ridge. About 15 seconds after the first sound the same type of howl started up again then it went quiet dead quiet. The fox and coyotes went silent along with the dogs and cows and they normally donâ€™t. They will keep on til the wee hours of the morning. I got my coyote call out and attempted to get the thing to make the howl again but it wouldnâ€™t. I tried to get the coyotes to make noise but they wouldnâ€™t even call back to my call and thatâ€™s what struck me as weird. Iâ€™m an outdoor guy. Iâ€™ve heard coyotes  bobcats and bears. And whatever this was sent the hairs on my neck up and it clearly startled my mom and shut the animals in the woods up also. ,The area has scattered farms and lots of hills and mountains surrounding it along with lots of forest and woods. Thereâ€™s a reservoir right near my house also thatâ€™s not a far drive thatâ€™s stocked with fish and to me it be the perfect place for a Bigfoot to be close to no people there.

1994,I believe it was May or early June of 1985.  I rented a cabin in the Catoctin State Park with a friend and we just spent one night.  The cabin was just a simple one room building with a window on either side and a cabinet to store your belongings.  There were two army style cots on either side of the cabin  each near a window.  It was very rustic.  The door didn  t even have a lock on it  it was just a wooden latch that went through a slot on the door frame. My friend and I hiked during the day and then went to some store and bought submarine sandwiches and a bottle of wine.  As night was fallng we sat out on the tiny porch  ate the sandwiches and split the bottle of wine.  It was a very pleasant evening.  We sat on the porch and talked for several hours  but by the time 10 00 PM rolled around  the combination of all of the hiking and the bottle of wine made us sleepy. My friend and I turned in for the night and we both fell asleep very soon.  My friend is a very heavy sleeper  but I  m a much lighter sleeper.  At some point during the night I was awakened by something.  I didn  t know what it was  just that my sleep had been disturbed.  I lay in bed and just listened  starting to fall back asleep when I heard this strange cry off in the distance.  I had no idea what it could be having never heard it before.  I would hear a series of three or four crys and then silence.  Then after about a minute or two it would start up again  only sounding closer each time it started anew.  It was a very weird sound. I just lay there and listened and I kept thinking that the only thing that I could match it up with was the cry of a gibbon that I had heard on TV.  But I thought  that certainly can  t be what it is.  I  m not exactly an expert  but I  m a big nature lover and I  m fairly familiar with the common animals of Maryland and I just had no idea what the sound was.  Well  it just kept getting louder and louder each time the next series of cries started.  It sounded like it was maybe a half a neighborhood block away when  even though it was a warm night  I shut the window near my bed because it was so creepy. I tried to gently awaken my friend on the other cot  but to no avail.  I remember that I had to go to the bathroom  but was to uneasy to go out.  There was no bathroom  just the woods.  I stayed awake for about another hour and since I didn  t hear the cries anymore  I went out on the porch and urinated as fast as I could and went back in and locked the door and eventually went back to sleep.  I told my friend about it the next day  we had a laugh and that was it.  I have thought about it on and off all these years. What prompted me to report it is that I saw and then bought the Discovery film   Sasquatch  Legend Meets Science.   There is this segment of the film where this older male scientist and his young female assistant are analyzing these sounds reported to be Sasquatch vocalizations.  When I heard the crys that they were listening to  chills just went up my spine.  They are darn close to  if not exactly what I heard that night in the cabin in Catoctin State Park. I have never heard anything like that in the woods before that night or since  except the first time that I watched that Discovery Special about the efforts of those scientists trying to use scientific disciplines to prove or disprove the existence of Sasquatch. ,The only thing I can remember at this point is that it was The Catoctin Mountain State Park.  I remember that there was a public swimming pool not too far from the cabin. ,Fredrick,2,Maryland ,MD,Spring ,24021,no
1995,It was in at the end of August 2003. My self and a friend were fishing the Potomac River. We Were fishing between mile marker 57 and 58 off the C&O Canel. We parked in the town of Knoxville Maryland and crossed the rail road tracks to get to the river. We were fishing in a brach of the Potomac that was about 600 meters long before it went back into the river. We got to the spot around 8 00 AM we had our backs to the Potomac when fishing the banks of the branch. Behind us was the Potomac. There was an island that was about 600 meters long and about 200 meters at it widest point. The island is a hill and you can  t see the Potomac from were we were fishing. We were only there about Five mintues when heard what sounded like a dying deer. My friend heard it too  I said it sounds like some one shot a deer and it was dying. This whole time we were walking down the river and fishing at the same time. As I got farther down the branch of the river my friend said what is that alful smell. I said it must be that deer. My friend said that is the worst smell I have ever smelt before. Then we heard some thing moving behind us on the island. I was thinking that deer is not dead yet. I started to walk across the water (which was about three feet deep) to the other side to see it. As I was walking I could smell it and it was getting worst. My friend said what is it  I don;t know I can  t see any thing but I can smell it. He started walking over towards me. He was walking with the river (south east) I was standing in front of a hill and could not see over it. Wear he was walking from he could see over the hill. I was about 50 meters down river from him. He said John I see some thing  I said is it a deer. No I think it is a bear. I started to walk back and towards him. I was hoping it was not going to atttack us. I said lets go some place else. I wanted to fish not get attacked by a bear. He was walking to me and I was walking towards him I said lets go. Then were heard it again and I said that dose not sound like a bear.He said No but it might be a bigfoot. I said all the more reasons to go some place else. As I got to the bank acrossed from the island I got up on land to see if I could see it. He was still in the water but walking towards the bank wear I was standing. I could not see any thing but I did hear some thing walking on the other side of the hill. I said maybe it was a hunter and he killed a deer and now he is coming over the hill back to his car draging the deer. The steps were getting louader and I could smell the smell with every breath. At this point I am ready to run. I was a 4 18 miler in college and I was hoping my feet don  t fail me now. It stopped and we could not hear it any more. I would have ran like hell if I would have seen a bigfoot. That might have been the day I went sub 4 00 in the mile. We left and talked about all day long. We still talking about it. He likes to tell the story I don  t go up that way much. , ,Fredrick,2,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24021,yes
1996,This incident occurred on a surf trip to Ocean City Md. with my high school friend and surfing buddy but we had gone up rt. 404 into Delaware to cut down from Rehobeth beach. I  m not sure where EXACTLY but it was between a number of farms and on a road off of 404 which we considered a shortcut. The area was dense pine trees and I would guess it was late spring as there was no traffic at all and usually in summer there was even at the time we were travelling  between 3 and 4 AM. We were moving at about 60 to 70 MPH and looking out for deer and were very much awake. I saw a pair of eyes off in the woods some ways up  perhaps 100 meters when I noticed them and as we were closing rapidly I braked fairly heavily. My friend and I saw what I can only describe as an absolutely enormous hairy creature moving VERY fast from the passenger side of the road to the left side. I would estimate it to be at least 8 feet to the shoulder and hunched forward  almost on four legs but definitely NOT a quadruped. It was positively terrifying and we both looked at each other and said  WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!?! . I will never forget the size of the thing. Neither of us have any idea what it was but both of us were outdoorsmen and camped regularly and experienced in the woods. For many years afterward we have speculated what it was and I think I may have told three or four people about it but never was taken entirely seriously. ,near pine forest and creeks ,Dorchester,2,Maryland ,MD,Spring ,24019,yes
1997,Hello  this might take a moment didn  t know how to contact the BFRO. I  m a Native American from Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe in MN. I currently reside in Pennsylvania in a town name Birdsboro. I recently had weird noises and seen odd things in the woods where I go for spiritual guidance. I seen big rocks placed in a crescent moon shape and found strange scat that had fur and what kinda looked like a cat tail reed top digested in it. Then found a huge tree trunk or broken tree that looks to be placed in the gut of two trees like a football goal post. Just recently  May 29th 2014  I was with a close friend we was in this same location looking for feathers that were molted by eagles. I have a federally recognized tribal ID so am able to pick up those fallen molted feathers. But while we were looking for these it was close to sunset and was right next to a swamp then we hear  a loud splash  like there was a huge rock thrown in the water. We both looked at one another in shock cause we were the only two people in the woods then. I thought it coulda been a beaver cause beavers live in the swamp  but thought it was a beaver jumping in the water. Beavers don  t make that loud cur-plunk splash we heard  then I thought maybe an eagle may have dropped a big fish in the water like a  nope wasn  t that cause 3mins after we heard the first splash we heard a 2nd splash the same area like 10-15ft away from us. The area is over grown and can barely make your way through in some areas. But heard the noise the 2nd time  we went to look closer didn  t see or hear anything in that area but there was a path made through the thick weeds like something went through that area recently cause the tall thick weeds and brush was pushed through like a buffalo was walking through it. When we were leaving the area we heard chattering like someone was talking in the distance but no one was in the woods at the time we was. I have pictures of the log in the tree like a goal post and I can get pictures of the rock moon shape and if you read this I will give you the location thank you so much for taking the time to read my letter. ,I DO NOT WANT THE LOCATION listed as its a sacred area to Native people but I will show you what I have found and seen along with my friend. ,Cecil,1,Maryland ,MD,Spring ,24015,no
1998,In 1981  I was on the South Branch of the Patapsco River  approx. 1 mile downstream from Rt.32.  This section of river flattens out into riffles then empties into a larger pool.  I have fished this part of the river since I moved to Maryland from Pennsylvania in 1976. I was fishing on the north bank of the river and noticed a stray large mixed breed dog showing alot of interest on the south bank.  This area has about 100 ft open area before it becomes wooded.  The dog suddenly started to bark and jumped at something that stood up in the brush near the river.  This animal  the best terms I can describe  stood approx. 7-8 ft. and had the shape of a slouching human  full dark brown matted hair covering the body.  The creature was making a ticking sound....hard to describe. The dog lunged at it and quickly was slammed to the ground by the creature.  By this time  I was wading across the shallow area of the river and caught a scent of this animal....reminded me of a heavy musk smell...kind of like that of a fox.  The dog ran away and the creature started to walk into the woods.  I tried to walk behind it  but I was in waders and lost sight of the creature.  I did see the dog a bit later and it had blood on it  s mouth and backside. I drove to a phone in Sykesville and called the police.  I was told to return to the scene and wait.  It took me about 3 mins to get back....and a police cruiser (State Police) was already there.  I was immediately told to leave the area.  I returned an hour later and noticed several state vehicles and one federal vehicle as well as police...the area was taped off.  I could see people combing the area....I was told once again to leave. I tried for several days to get answers from state official but never got an answer. I called WJZ  WBAL and WMAR about the incidents and each seem very interested.  I contacted each station later and was told that they had  no idea  of an incident and did not want to talk to me. That  s about it....I was very frustrated by this.

1999,On or about May 17th 2001  My Boyfriend and I were fishing at Liberty Watershed in Baltimore county. It was early in the morning  we arrived at 8 am. We parked at ********* road and walked down to the water which took about 10 min. As he was preparing to fish ( I am not really into fishing) I was looking around. I noticed that the fish were jumping so there was a good bit of water splashing  but I heard what sounded like someone running through the water in a shallow area. I asked him what it was but he didn  t know and we thought it was just the fish. Then around 10 I saw something moving around in the swamp area (the same area where the wading sounds were coming from. In a split second I saw what appeared to be a large man with rasta type hair. I called for my boyfreind but  the man  was already disapearing through the woods. He did happen to see the branches moving though. I asked him what that was but he couldn  t tell. I am not sure exactly what I saw but I looked through and found pictures of Bigfoot and I wholeheartedly beleive that that is what I saw. ,I think I described it well enough in the begining. I just don  t want to be ridiculed about this. ,Baltimore,3,Maryland ,MD,Spring ,24005,yes
2000,I  was  playing  near  a  creek  on  a  elevated  point.I  happened  to  glance  up  into  a  thicket  about  30  yards away.there  was  a  creature  about  as  tall  as  a  small  tree  beside  it.I  guess  the  tree  was  around  8  foot.It  was  a  muscular  shape  with  brownish  grayish  colored  hair.Surprisingly  the  feet  were  not  as  large  as  you  would  think.But  yet  they  were  still  larger  than  a  average  human  being.He  turned  around  began  to  walk  towards  the  creek  above  the  hill.In  fright  I  ran  away.Never  saw  it  again ,It  was  of  the  road.I  was  kinda  lost.I  tend  to  do  that  so  I  do  not  really  know  where  I  was  I  was  in  the  woods  off  of  Georges  Creek  Blvd. ,Allegany,3,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24001,yes
2001,It happened to my older brother  who was a disbeliever at the time. He was spending the night in the Chevy Open Road camper  parked in our driveway  which our parents owned at the time. It was a Saturday night in the early summer. He considered it cool to spend the night in the camper. At that time there had been a   flap   of sightings in the area  and WDCA Ch. 20 had been playing up on this during their midnight   Creature Feature   horror movies. At the end of the movie  I jokingly took a BB pistol to my brother to protect himself should he encounter one. At about 1 30 am  he had shut the TV off and was going to sleep when he noticed a shadow which was cutting back and forth thru the window of the camper (it was closed curtain). The shadow was from a light in our nextdoor neighbor  s yard back porch light  which was a   clear shot   between the camper and the porch (no wind  trees to block  etc.) He got real quiet and watched as the shadow moved closer to the camper. This type of camper had a translucent plastic roof  and if a light was shone on the roof  you could easily see it  or a shadow. Needless to say  the thing came up and slowly walked around the camper  lightly tapping the sides of the camper while walking around it.He could also see the shadow of a   head   through the roof  so the thing has to be around 9-10 ft. tall to do this. The next morning he came in at the crack of dawn and told what happened -! He didn  t sleep at all and was scared stiff. We found fingerprint smudges on the sides of the van  and a handprint on the hood which was quite large  about 6-7      wide. There were also large toeprints in some sand which was spilled in the yard. We don  t know what it was  but it was real  and very large. ,Annapolis  Anne Arundel County  summer of 1970 0r 1971. At the time it was a main thoroughfare area  with a lot of wooded places still intact. The incident happened on Bay Ridge Avenue  near the SPCA. ,Anne Arundel,9,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24003,yes
2002,I came across your website  and decided to look for reports in Anne Arundel County  Maryland. After reading the posted reports  I thought I  d share the following  I resided in the Annapolis area for approximately 8 years  from 1969-1977  and lived in numerous areas in and around the city. In 1972-73  I was living in the Saferan (sp?) area  outside of Epping Forest  on the outskirts of Annapolis. This area was a wooded peninsula extending into the Severn River. During the summer of   72 or   73  I was 10-11 years old. One evening I awoke because of the summer heat. My bed lay roughly 2 feet from and parallel to the bedroom window. The bedroom window was on the ground floor level and faced a roadway lit by a single street light in this area. I recall having just awoke and sat upright in bed  looking to my left at the floor fan. I recall thinking that the evening was very  very hot. As I sat in my bed waking up  I turned to my right  looking directly into the window. What I saw can only be described as a large head  with distinct hair covering it; it was much  much larger than any human head. I recall seeing the thing  s eyes blinking at me  from a distance of 2-4 feet. I also recall seeing the teeth in it  s mouth. The eyes and the teeth contrasted sharply from the darkness of the rest of the head. The light from the roadway was behind and to the thing  s left  so I wasn  t able to make out any distinct features  other than the eyes and the teeth. There were no sounds other than the fan. This thing was making no threatening moves  in fact it was doing nothing other than looking into my bedroom window and seeing me looking at it. After maybe 10-15 seconds  during which time I went from trying to comprehend what I was seeing to being very  very frightened  I lay back down on my bed  rolled off the bed to my left and crawled out of my bedroom on my hands and knees to a bathroom. My mother found me sometime in the bathroom. When I relayed the story to her  she told me the curtains were closed and to go back to bed. I know the curtains weren  t closed  but  thanks mom. For what it  s worth. ,This sighting occurred within 50 yards of a residential street  Epping Forest Road. ,Anne Arundel,9,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24003,yes
2003,It was 1978 or 79 in mid-summer early fall.A friend and I were in the woods behind my house  which was located on Weems Creek in Admiral Heights  when we saw a 8 or 9 foot tall hunched figure completely covered in hair in the reeds maybe 300 feet away.We watched it for maybe 20 seconds before it saw us stood and took off for the woods.At the time we werent sure what we saw but we knew there had been sightings of bigfoot in the area.At the time I was 11 or12 years old and I never told anybody until a couple years ago but I remember it very clearly.What struck me at the time was how quickly it could run through the marshy area we saw it in   even as light as we were as kids we sunk to our knees but it didnt slow it down a bit.Whenever you mention Bigfoot people automatically think its a hoax  but there is no way on earth a man in a hairy suit could get out of that mud. , ,Anne Arundel,9,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24003,yes
2004,I was raised in Maryland and moved to South Carolina in 1984. I remember an event in 1981 or maybe 1982. I can  t be sure of the year  but I can recall the time of year--it was late Fall  about 4-5pm in the afternoon. I grew up in a sub-division called Ben Oaks on the Severn. Theres a steam that runs by Shipey  s Choice and Ben Oaks across the road. At that time Shipey  s Choice was a new sub-division where homes were being built. The steam was at the bottom below two hills. I recall playing around the steam and following it back to Ben Oaks. I was alone and remember feeling like I was being watched. I looked up the hill in the area of the new sub-division about 250 ft. away and saw a bigfoot maybe 7-8 ft. tall. I didn  t know what it was at first. It was dark brown and big. I didnt have time to think. I was 13 yrs. old and running like hell. It just stood there looking. I put it together later and never told anyone. I didn  t think anyone would think I was telling the truth and kept it to myself. ,Near Severn Run  go up 301. It was Hwy 301 at the time & now I think it  s Hwy 97. About 1 mile towards the Anne Arundel police dept.  turn right on Old Benfield Rd. & go 1 mile. As you start coming up hill  just before the Ben Oaks sub-division there is a small stream at the bottom of the hill. ,Anne Arundel,9,Maryland ,MD,Fall ,24003,yes
2005,On 7 Oct 01  at approximately 6 30 pm (twilight) in the Severn Run State Park  while researching a previous sighting of an animal in this area  I spotted another animal  which had frozen in position (to avoid detection  it must have heard my car door shut)  at a distance of approx 150 yards off the roadway. The temperature had dropped dramatically  causing a fog to rise over a stream between myself and the animal  partly obscuring my view. I had parked alongside the road  and was standing behind my car  looking into the woods when I spotted the animal standing in the undergrowth (growth is approximately five feet tall  and the animal was approximately three feet above that  slightly bent over). Severn Run State Park  is a state stocked trout stream  which runs from the Odenton area to the Severn River near Annapolis  the state capitol and home of the US Naval Academy. The woods here at this location are mature trees  with lots of undergrowth  no  middle growth  trees  so visibility is good through the growth. Lots of greenbriar and small trees approximately five feet tall. The animal was traveling towards Odenton  and was facing towards the right. Its head was lowered slightly  looking in my direction and was turned in such a way that I could only see one arm  the back  and its face. The animal was a light tan in color  approx 8-9 feet tall. It had large eyebrow ridges which cast a shadow over its eyes (didn  t see eyes)  a large jaw  a roundish face  MASSIVE shoulder muscles  and huge biceps. The animal had long head hair  which extended down to about the bottom of its shoulder blades. No hair hung over its face. The hair on the body of the animal appeared to be short and tight to the body  not shaggy or matted. Coloration was constant over the body and head. I yelled  HEY!   clapped my hands and whistled. The animal wouldn  t move. After approximately 15 min I left the area.  It was too dark for any photos to turn out from my cheap camera. The exact location is currently under observation by the BFRO  and will be revealed at a later date. Thank you for your understanding. ,Severn Run State Park.

2006,I came across your webpage for a project at my school  Anne Arundel Community College  and I noticed that I had a similar story near that same area in Odenton. My friends and I were camping along the Little Patuxent river-bed in August of 2001. It lies near the road  Piney Orchard Parkway  and railroad tracks but they are still used. Approximatley 2-3 a.m. we heard groaning and splashing in the water nearby. this was later confirmed later that morning though. When I heard the noise I thought it was one of my friends. So I peaked my head out to see but it was too dark so I yelled to  shutup  and the being ran away. Once again I thought it was my friends just playin around so I wasn  t concerned and I didn  t investigate. When the sun rose we started packing up and notice huge footprints in the sand that led into the trees coming from the water. The stides were enormous  we could fit one of my shorter friends who is 5  4  between the prints easily. The size of the foot was very large about a size 19 or 20. I wear a 13 and it it dwarfed my shoesize. since then I have seen or heard nothing and we often go to that site for campfires and swimming. ,Trees  river ,Anne Arundel,9,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24003,yes
2007,I was bowhunting for deer yesterday (September 17th  2005) in the swamp bottoms of West River in Churcton  Maryland when I heard what I can only describe as jibberish hollering coming from behind the deer blind that I was in at about 100 yards or so.  It moved east to west hollering jibberish and moving closer and closer to where I was.  I unzipped the back of the deer blind to try and see with my field glasses what was making all that noise and scaring the deer away.  I saw nothing.  The sound was getting closer and I began to feel nervous even though I had permission to hunt there. Thats when the smell of damp musty roadkill mixed with dirty diapers hit me.  I had to exit the deer blind for fresh air and an overwhelming sense of fear gripped me. It was more of a safety issue that made me exit the deer blind and nock an arrow in my bow and leave the area as fast as I could before I came in contact with whatever was making the noise.  I was unnerved by the aggresive tone in the jibberish and hollering. The fact that it was close by and I could not see it coupled with the smell and the tone of its voice  made me realize that I had best leave the area  and quickly. As I exited the woods  I walked briskly towards my vehicle and was approximately twenty five yards from my truck when I heard more loud jibberish coming paralell from me about twenty yards in the woods.  Whatever it was was following me and that unnerved me even more and I headed straight for my truck with my bow fully drawn and ready to fire at whatever was stalking me.  Again  I saw nothing.  No movement in the woods and I made my way to my truck and released my draw without shooting my arrow.  I put my bow in the back seat of my Suburban and cranked up my truck and left immediately.  I have never felt that way in the woods in my entire life.  I have hunted bear  wild pig and deer all of my life and never have I ever felt the need to flee the woods.   Until now. ,Incident occured in Churchton  Maryland on Shady Side Road between Shady Side Road and West River in the West River swamp bottoms.

2008,I am a 44 yr. old woman  I am submitting this in request of my husband & grown son.  As an avid   birder   (loves bird watching)  I was taking an early morning walk (6 45 a.m.) around Oxbow Lake to see what birds were   out & about  . Almost as soon as I started the short trail around the lake  I noticed that there was no activity.....none  no birds  no deer  no squirrels  nothing. This seemed VERY odd to me  because it was a beautiful spring morning  the sun was shining and there wasn  t even the smallest breeze in the air. Then I noticed that the birds weren  t even singing  I could not hear one bird song or call  which is very unusual because there is ALWAYS a lot of bird activity here  especially in the early morning. Then  I noticed that not even the frogs  or the peepers were making any sound...it was complete silence. When I reached the part of the trail where I usually see deer  there was nothing. It was just about in this area where I started to smell this terrible odor....hard to explain  a strong musky smell  not like a dog or a skunk but a definite heavy odor of musk  one I have never smelled before and I have spent a lot of time in the woods. While I was standing quietly trying to figure out what/where the odor was coming from  a live tree 30-40 ft. high (unknown species) fell about 100-150 ft. from me  it just fell  and there was not even a small breeze that day! I have spent my childhood in the deep woods of Adirondack Mountains. and this just went against every natural law I could think of.....and believe me I tried to rationalize this! I then had this intense feeling that I was being watched...no more like being stared at  and then I got the sense that perhaps the tree had been pushed  like a warning. I decided I should start making my way back towards my car  still not hearing or seeing ANY wildlife. Just before getting back in my car I went to an overlook and all of a sudden I heard from the opposite side of the lake a loud howling  it echoed thru the marsh area. After 3-4 deep  loud howls  again silence. I walked back to my car and drove home. ,Oxbow Lake Nature Preserve ,Anne Arundel,9,Maryland ,MD,Spring ,24003,no
2009,Can  t remember exactly when it was but it was sometime in the mid-90  s over in the far western portion of Anne Arundel County - Laurel to be exact where 3 counties come together - Anne Arundel  Howard  and Prince Georges.  We lived up off of Brock Bridge Road parallel to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and one evening out with the dog out back - our home backed up to woods - I hear a rustling noise behind what was a drainage pond for our community. It was summer and the sun was getting ready to go down so it was dusk-like -- I turned - and by the way so did the dog - our Labrador Retriever -  and could not believe my eyes. I observed a large - I am guessing 10-11 feet high - ape-like figure stalking in the woods behind the pond - I would say it was about 100 yards away.  I just froze - and so did our dog.  No one else witnessed this and we just both stood there for what seemed like 2 minutes - until the creature turned and looked our way and then slowly turned and dashed back off in to the woods....never to be seen again.  I remember this like it was yesterday but did not know about this site until today when my awesome nephew  AB  told me about  it.....so....here I am today...reporting this incident so everyone can be aware and know the truth. ,From Brock Bridge Road follow River Bridge Way west to left on Forest Bridge Court then right on Serene Court.

2010,I was a frequent visitor to my grandparents since I was born in 1985. When i was 8  on a walk down to the baseball diamond one night  i heard a stirring in the woods. Figuring it to be maybe a hunter (I was ignorant of hunting seasons at the time- so I could not rule that out)  I turned around to head towards the woody hillside along the driveway to greet the hunter  or to threaten him off the property (my grandfather allowed certain people to hunt deer when in season) from a safe distance. however  instead of seeing a person with reflective gear  I saw a large  tall shadowy figure with odd eyes- its eyes glowed red  probably from a reflection or something... it slowly backed away though  and headed up the hillside. Scared  i ran back to my grandparents home and told my folks i saw something- (they told me it was a fox  but i know from wat i saw that is impossible) They all laughed it off. But on the way going back down the driveway  my folks stopped because one dropped something in the car. while our car was temporarily not moving  I curiously looked out the window and over toward the hillside  and i could make out the shadow and the eyes. I was 8 at the time  but I was rather intelligent for a kid- I knew what a deer looked like  what a fox looked like. Since that time in 1993  Ive heard sounds and reports of similar activity. Ive also noticed the occasional long shadowy figures and eyes  but from a safer distance (and from my car!) and long after i started to get used to the things. , ,Baltimore,3,Maryland ,MD,Fall ,24005,yes
2011,In mid spring of this year  I was hiking through the woods with a friend in the middle of the night. Making our way up onto a trail  we stumbled upon a picnic table and decided to sit down and rest. We were startled to find the whole ground glowing green around us. Using my headlamp  we attempted to spot whatever was causing these little glowing green dots. At the time we had no clue what was causing this to happen  but we later realized that firefly larvae were lighting up the forest floor. Seeing the glows coming more intensely from a nearby hillside deeper in the woods  we decided to scan the the hillside with our headlamp. As soon as we shined the headlamp  we caught a pair or grapefruit sized bright green (with a slight hint of gold) eye reflections peering over the crest of the hill. We stood in shock  never removing the light from those eyes.  Maybe its a deer   she said. A few moments later the eyes raise up to be about 5 off the ground and rotate slightly more towards us.  See   I say   It is just a deer.  As soon as that last word leaves my mouth the eye reflections stand up another 4 feet to be standing at a towering 9 feet. It slowly occurred to be that I had never seen eye reflections of this color and that the closest thing might be a bear. Suddenly I hear a slight rustling behind me. Swinging the light around we caught the reflections of two more sets of eyes. They too were grapefruit sized and green  but were spookily sneaking up on us from behind. I get caught in a frenzy of shinning the light back and forth between all three sets of eyes until they just quietly disappear. we hurried out of the area  terrified  and made our way south to a different hiking area to take the whole situation in. Again we noticed firefly larvae  but when we began to approach the woods (which in fact are connected to the last area by water system) a bunch of creatures began running around in the woods  breaking branches and shaking bushes and trees. Later  upon watching one of your videos and discussing the experience with some knowledgable peers  I realized that I had experienced a sasquatch encounter.  Returning to the same spot some 2 or 3 months later with a few buddies  we were able to catch the same eye reflections for a very short period of time. ,I don  t want to include directions in this report. ,Baltimore,3,Maryland ,MD,Spring ,24005,yes
2012,11/20/12 I have been keeping my eyes peeled for any potential sign even though I live in a fairly populated area. I live on and drive up and down Carrollton Rd several times a week. What I noticed was a fresh break of a young tree  about 50-60 feet in from the road. Due to brambles  and being private property  I didn  t go in for exact measurements but I  m a pretty good estimator. This break is about 6 feet off the ground  maybe 5  the tree is approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. I noticed that there are significant scrape marks on one the road side of the tree  can  t see the other side  The marks are ONLY below the break. I also found what looks like definite depressions in the leaf litter  with a bit of compressed bare ground  one about 6 feet in from the road at the tree line  and one about 2 feet from the guardrail. I carry a tape measure with me in my car as part of my tools for farriery  so I was able to lay it out at what I believe is the length of the depressions and get pictures. Of course I couldn  t resist doing a few knocks  there were some good rocks at the roadside so I did one knock  waited about 10 seconds then did two more about 2 seconds apart. I waited about two seconds  stood up  took two steps and heard a response knock!!! It sounded like it was certainly past the hill (top is about 3-500 yards from road) and probably well past that  guessing within a half mile. I waited about 30 seconds  put out a few more knocks  nothing. Couldn  t help a few short whoops  no response. ,Location is  ruralurbia  - Carroll county is farm lands interspersed with residential and horse property and also has a fair networking of wooded areas still intact.

2013,This was told to me from a neighbor which showed me a cast of a foot print which was big(didn  t measure it)I was living in Edgewood at the time  Maryland  about 15mis. away or so from where it happened.The people had dogs getting into thier trash and the owner bought a 22 rifle to get the dogs as he put it. He has a cement pad about 10 by 6 ft with a fence 6ft high around three sides of it. The trash cans were inside the fence.On night he heard noises out side he got his rifle and looked out back.The porch light showed nothing near the trash cans but outside the fence he could see a shape of something so he shot up in the air.The animal  which he could only describe as a big ape got up and he could see it  s shouders and head above the fence.It took off as it rose up turning back towards the woods in a hurry.It tore up freshly planted bushes in it  s path. The ground left  no tracks other then in the soft dirt around the bushes.That  s the plaster cast the neighbor showed me.He gave it to the neighbor because he decided he didn  t believe in what he saw and didn  t want to be haunted by the sighting.They had the police there but I guess he made sure it was kept out of the papers.He just didn  t want his name out there. ,Fallston  Maryland Not far from the Little Gunpowder river ,Harford,6,Maryland ,MD,Unknown ,24025,yes
2014,I was riding my motorcyle north on Rt 165 having just passed the John Deere dealership. This particular section of road is straight for more then a mile. I was about a quarter of the way into this mile-long stretch when I saw a large dark 2-legged  thing  come out of the woods on the right side of the road. I initially thought that it was a person  except that it crossed the road in 6 steps. This road is a single lane in both directions with a shoulder on each side capable of getting a broken down vehicle completely off the road. It disappeared into the woods on the other side of the road. It was walking and there was no other traffic on the road at the time. ,Harford County  Maryland  just south of Whiteford on Rt 165. ,Harford,6,Maryland ,MD,Summer ,24025,yes
2015,First of all this is the first time I have ever come forward in writing about this incident(s) that took place approximately 18-19 years ago. Myself  my Uncle and a few hunting buddies frequented a 68 acre parcel of land in Street  MD.  One day we were conducting target practice (sighting in our guns) for the upcoming hunting season.  It was a warm  sunny day and off in the distance one of us noticed movement in a wooded area across Broad Creek.  It appeared that there was a large dark silhouette walking back and forth in the foliage.  Every time it walked back and forth it would stop and grab a hold of a large tree and began to shake it.  Keep in mind this was a calm warm day and no other trees were moving because there was no wind.  I thought it was very unusual behavior and must have taken an enormous amount of strength to be able to shake a tree of this size.  I peered through my 4 X rifle scope to examine the object more closely and observed it to walk upright and was covered with dark brownish hair.  Its head was large and I could only observe the upper half of the body.  When it turned  its arms appeared to be long and muscular and I could see that its back was very muscular too and had a  V  shape to it  which led me to believe that this was no bear.  It seemed to be agitated that we were there.  After about 15-20 minutes of watching it we decided to leave and never spoke of the incident again. Additional things  In October just after dusk that same year on the same parcel of property my uncle was walking from the the dirt road area through a grassy area down a hill to the barn.  I heard him yell and call out to me.  I came running thinking he had fell down and I observed him on the ground with his tools scattered all over the ground.  I smelled a horrible pungent odor  heard heavy breathing and large foot steps coming from the near by wooded area.  It was dark and I could not see anything and I got an eerie feeling of being watched.  I got my uncle up off the ground and he told me as he was walking down the grassy trail  he heard long loud foot steps coming up from behind him. Thinking it was one of us playing a prank on him  he braced himself for one of us to jump on his back  however whatever hit him from behind knocked him with such force  he feel forward to the ground causing him to drop his tool box.  He said whatever hit him ran into the woods and was grunting and walking back and forth.  We both got flash lights and tried to look in the wooded area where we heard the heavy breathing but did not see anything but heard what sounded like bipedal footsteps go down the large decline and cross the creek at the bottom.

2016,here in maryland theres not a lot to do. mostly me and my friends just hang out. the local cops dont like this and neither do the business owners. so alot of times we end up in parks or  parking  spots. on this night 8 people were gathered at this location in 4 cars. we all met up in town around 8-9 in the evening. thew cops decided too many people were gathering and chased us off. one local drinking or partying spot is nicknamed the  lodges . basically its gunpowder state park. a well known local fishing hole  the subject to indian related ghost stories and a middle of nowhere spot in the middle of civilization. we decided to head there. we arrived around 10. we proceeded on the usual chatting of whos car is faster  whos dating who and such. some people were using drugs. one or two had been drinking. me  my friend tom  and jason were not on this night. we all sat pretty quietly in our cars. nobody had been out accept for the occasional rearranging of seating for close to 4 hours. i do remember that it was very cold that night for our area. probably around 40 degrees? and it was definetly before halloween  since we werre making plans. three cars were facing forwards. my 87 mustang toms 68 mustang and brians dodge omni. the other ones were not. we were all parked side by side in a row facing a almost 45 degree grade of dense shrubs and 15- 30 foot tall trees. the road (bottom rd.) was in front and the bend in the stream was behind us with boulders and shrubs all around.lighting wasnt the best  but enough to make out the trees close to 50 feet away and ground cover around them.the area is almost indescribable. i could draw it for you or get a picture possibly. what happened was around 2-3 o clock we all stop talking to the noise of what sounded like someone running through the woods. i figued it was a deer. then you hear it crashing down the hill in front of us. this sounded like someone taking a running step down the side of a steep  loose gravel hill  breaking off limbs and whtever else they could grab to help slow them down. then- plop- out onto the road lands this human figure. i was looking down at this point. in the car next to me tommy goes  jesus christ  and i look up to see a dark huge figure hunch over to look back at us. instinctlively brian in the omni and i pull on our headlights almost at the same time. it was still a little hazy from the stream behind us and all i personally could make out by the time my eyes refocused was what looked like a humanoid figure  close to 8 foot tall  sprinting away from us. i can still destinctly remember the sound of it running away  exactly like someone running barefoot on blacktop or concrete. a slapping noise. i unfroze and got out. so did tommy and brian.we walked up the road a little and i felt really weird. at this point the last word spoken was tommys jesus christ. we all got into our cars. we sat there for about 10 minutes. then simultaneously we turned to each other and said  its getting late  or   im too tired for this  and decided to all head out. NOBODY spoke about this to each other for almost a year. some people that were there still wont talk about it willingly or in front of others. honestly i thought it was a gag at first. theres also alot of indian ghost stories tied to the area because of an indian graveyard. i dont know what it was. i dont care. all i know is that was not a man. and it sure as hell was not a deer.if you guys can explain it any other way for me thats fine. but i have at least 6 other witnesses i can get ahold of for you. alot of time has passed since this happened and alot of construction has happened also. so if it was what you are looking for its long gone now.but after the fact i have heard of a few other sightings like this  including a set of footprints less than 5 miles south of the area and within a year of our encounter.the area is bottom rd. and laurelbrook rd in fallston md. harford co / baltimore co  just inside the boundaries of the gunpowder state park. ,off of i-95  exit on md route 152 north (fallston/joppa) towards fallston. travel north for approx. 10-15 minutes. cross bel air rd then harford road. take the next left onto old fallston rd. follow 1 mile or less to laurelbrook rd. make left onto laurel brook. follow to bottom rd. when on bottom road pass road with bride on right  at the turn in the road is a pull off immediately afterwards. this is where the incident occured. this location is in small valley. almost like a gorge. a tight turn to the left in  the dirt road is where the pull off is. a pond like bend in the stream is on the right side of the road with what forms a 100 ft by 5 ft stoney beach of sorts. some large boulders between the road and stream. on the left of the road is a cut out embankment about 4 or 5 feet high. then a steep hill rises about 100 yds up gaining roughly 3 feet higher per 2 foot of distance. very steep. covered with middle aged trees  bushes and alot of leaves/old brush.some rocks jutting out here and there.the road is almost level around the bend  coming off a hill and going back up a mild grade continuing away.a unique  cozy little area with just enough tall trees to feel like your out in the middle of nowhere withlarge fields on the other side of the trees on the oppsing shoreline of the stream. ,Harford,6,Maryland ,MD,Fall ,24025,yes
2017,Footprints next to the road were on the local news. Also  a week later footprints were found less than a mile away in the neighborhood of Pleasant Hills. There was a 7 ft stride   suggesting the the creature may have been leaping or running. A family reported seeing a 10 ft tall creature. Noises like howling have been heard along with mutilated deer bodies being found in the winter. There have been campers who have noticed something prowling near their RVs. ,Harford County  MD.

2019,I was on my way to work on a Saturday morning about 7 a.m.  It was a misty  foggy morning and I headed west on Rt 198 entering a elongated (approx. 1 mile) entrance ramp to Southbound I-95.  I had my lights on my small toyota and my windshield washers were on at intermittent speed.  I witnessed what I thought was a man come up from a steep ravine  walk over to the ramp guardrail and step over it in angular fashion.  I thought here comes someone looking to hitchhike this morning.  The  man  was tall and his appearance was a drab kind of mushroom color from head to foot.  I thought he was wearing smoked of rain parka or slicker because there wasn  t a clear indentation from his head to the top of his shoulders.  As I got closer I realized that this  suit  was not material but looked like long wet matted fur/hair/yuck.   The  man  proceeded to step into the roadway.  I thought what is this jerk doing trying to commit suicide with my help.  He got several feet into the lane when he turned to face my oncoming car.  He stood there looking perplexed and actually swayed side to side several times as though he didn  t know what was coming at him....my car.  All of sudden he startled and turned and ran back to the guardrail.  He bolted over the guard rail and went scurrying down the embankment.  My mouth was agape and I thought  what in the hell was that!!!  I was frightened and was too scared to even look over my shoulder or even into the rear view mirror. When I got to work that morning in Silver Spring  Maryland  I was shaking like a leaf.  My co-workers immediately noticed that I was upset.  I called the Laurel police to inquire if there had been any reports of an escaped gorilla in the area.  They thought I was kidding.  I called my fiancee and told him.  Years later there was an article in our local county paper about a man who was writing a book on big foot sightings in the area.  His article spoke of a sighting by two employees of a water treatment plant that was located within 150 yards of my sighting and this sighting had occurred in the Spring of 1976 just like mine.  Also his article said a scientist working at N.A.S.A. had also witnessed a big foot sighting in the same area as he headed for work in Greenbelt  Maryland.  I almost started to cry  all these years and what I had seen had stayed with me was finally being  vindicated .  I called the author of the article and related my story to him.  Several days later  though  I got a strange phone call.  The person on the end of the line was a male voice that asked me what the  frequency was .  I told him I didn  t know what he as talking about  but he was very persistent that I knew the  frequency   I felt that this call was somehow related to the call I had had with the writer of the article several days earlier...maybe coincidence but still I wondered. ,Laurel  Maryland.  It was sighted off of Rt 198 and I-95 in an area considered West Laurel.  This big foot was sighted by others and has been dubbed locally as the Scaggsville Monster.  (Scaggsville  Maryland about 3 miles to the north of my sighting.)  It has been reported that others in that area had seen it. ,Prince George  s,2,Maryland ,MD,Spring ,24033,yes
2020,I  d like to make a report  however it was years ago but I remember every part pretty well. I told a few folks about this over the years and they think I was nuts. But doesn  t matter what they think. I was close enough to know what it was. I would say about less than 50 ft. Right in the middle of a fire road. In December 1977  my dad  uncle and my dad  s other friends and myself went up to the cabin owned by a hunters club in Gardner  Mass. We went to spend the night  cook food and my dad and his friends like to play cards after eating supper. Myself and a friend used the snowmobile with a sled attached to the back  we took turns driving the ski doo around and the other would stand on the foot rest on the sled. The area was in northern central Massachusetts  very close to New Hampshire boarder. The cabin is in Ashburnham Mass. It  s about 2.5 miles up a fire road called Old Colony Road. I remember it was a snowy winter that year. The area where we saw this thing was right on the edge of a swamp  old train tracks run right thru the area and crosses the fire road that we used to get to the cabin. It was about 4 p.m. or so  it was just getting a little dark. My friend and I left the cabin with the snowmobile  he was driving first and I was on the foot rest on the sled. We left and came up to the swamp  crossed over the tracks and headed down the road about 50 ft or so. It was getting a little late and we decided to not go to far so we turned the sled around on the road. Had to pick it up because of the narrowness of the road. Once we turned it around it was my turn to drive. So now were facing the tracks and the swamp is on both sides of the road. the road goes right thru the swamp and the tracks cross right by the edge of the swamp. At this point I looked behind me to see if my friend was on the sled and holding on  when I looked up I saw this creature walking on 2 legs like a human. He crossed right by the tracks at the edge of the swamp and crossed the road right in front of us. I remember it looking at us and I remember the arms swing clearly. Just like the pictures I have seen from your site. Very similar. Anyway  I remember the its size  that  s what was scarey  so large  I  d say about 7to 9 ft high  weight about 400 to 500 pounds. At least for something that size it would most likely be heavy. I know the woods there well. I  ve spent years in the military and hunt every year. I have been trained in tracking and survival in the woods so I know what I am saying and what I saw. But the thing took about 2 steps and he was across the road. All black hair  didn  t notice any smells  but I can tell you this. I won  t forget that day ever. It was cold anyway and with no breeze the smell of it wouldn  t travel far. My friend was shocked. He won  t even mention it when I see him these days. He told one person and they treated him like he was on drugs. So thats why I never wanted to tell to many people. I wanted to say something about it now because I just say a program on TV the other night about bigfoot and the Kiamichi Mountians  I think in Oklahoma or somewhere out there. I remember one other thing that might be relevant. That being noises I have been hearing over the years in the woods there. Something like a crying sound but so load it almost seemed as if it were close by. I think it was a ways away because when we heard the sounds it was late  about midnight. We sit by the fireplace outside the cabin sometimes late cooking steak or deer meat on the grill. Behind the cabin is a huge swamp area that goes up to Route 12 in Ashburnham  Mass. The swamp is down a bit behind the cabin. We find moose droppings back there and lots of tree scraps from deer. I beleive there passing thru that area at times. Those sounds I heard were never heard there before and I don  t hear them now when I go up there. Every now and then they seem to come back  but only when were outside sitting by the fire. Strange indeed. These woods go far as well and you could easily travel them and end up in New Hampshire or further without seeing a house. As time goes by and the more I read about what other folks saw and the similarities between each story I  m more wanting to do some of my own investigating  but its very scary out there at night  especially for me. I carry a loaded .44 when I  m up there just because I have seen this thing up close enough to know what it was. No doubt in my mind. ,Traveling northerly direction  crossing a swampy area and old train track beds that pass thru New Hampshire north. ,Worcester,6,Massachusetts ,MA,Winter ,25027,yes
2021,I was driving northbound on route 146. I was driving with my sister (the only other person in the car) and she was looking down at her I-Pod and was in the front passenger seat. The traffic was average not too many cars but a few  and I was doing about 65-68 mph.  I looked about 3/4 of a mile ahead and saw something off to the rightside of the highway not on the highway but near the woodline on the grass. At first it looked like someone possibly in a gilley suit but then as I got closer I couldn  t believe my eyes because it looked just like what you hear about and see artist renderings of a bigfoot like creature. It was too tall to be a person in a suit approx. 7-8ft tall and very broad with black hair. I couldn  t see any specific facial features or chest features as it turned into the woods when i was about 1/8 of a mile away. It was walking parralell to the woodline then took a 90 degree turn into the woods. When I saw this I immediately slowed down to about 50mph and looked intently into the woodline by this time I was able to get my sisters attention (she was listening to music on the I-Pod looking down) we both stared into the woods and Icouldn  t see anything but see thinks she saw something black moving in the woods. I still can  t believe what I saw  there was no cars parked on the left or right shoulders of the highway. The creature did not appear to be running the entire sighting lasted for 7-8 seconds. I am very sure of what I saw it was a dark haired looked very much like a bear walking on two legs. ,The location was on route 146 north bound lane on the right side shoulder of the highway near the woodline it was approx. 1/2 mile to 3/4 mile from where route 146 enters massachusetts from Rhode Island boader.

2022,I am 45 years old  have spent my whole life in the woods. I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said  maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped  ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day  and this was about noon time. As we walked back  we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed  Human  prints. In between the prints  was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said  why would someone be running Barefoot  in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot  the noise was  the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot  that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this  person . We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home. We walked for a couple hours  no way were we going back the way we came. Did not notice any smells or sounds. Just very quiet. No animal sound at all. ,Leominster state forest  back side of No Town Res. ,Worcester,6,Massachusetts ,MA,Summer ,25027,no

2024,On May 8th 2016 I was riding my four wheeler over on Fort Hill road in Oxford Webster area in the woods. I just hanging out by a swamp clearing a trail and had a weird feeling where something was watching me. My back was turned to the swamp and I heard a small splash coming across the swamp and didn  t really think nothing of it. About thirty seconds later I heard another one and that one caught my attention but I didn  t see it. It was bigger and it was in the middle of the swamp. So I dialed my buddy and as he picked up the phone  a rock about the size of a football  if not bigger was thrown about three quarters across the swamp and I saw this one hit the water. , ,Worcester,6,Massachusetts ,MA,Spring ,25027,no
2025,Hello! This is something that happened a long time ago and to be honest I never thought it could be connected to Sasquatch/Bigfoot but recently Iâ€™ve been reading about the topic a lot and I figured Iâ€™d send it to you guys after finding your site and just checking out reports from areas where Iâ€™ve lived in the past. Anyway  I found a report from Belchertown  MA and I lived a rural part of Belchertown for several years when I was in college. This was sometime around 1997-1998 in Belchertown. My housemates and I were out on our porch which faced a 2-3 acre meadow. This open meadow and the porch were on the east side of the house. The entire area past the meadow to the East was wooded with houses and cabins here and there for about a mile until you hit a lake. Behind the house was abput 10-20 yards of woods with a walking trail and then another 10 yards past was a train tracks running East/west then more woods. Anyway  my housemates and I were out on the porch when we heard the sound of a tree crashing to the ground.  About 19 seconds later while we all were kindve shocked there was an enormously loud and guttural growl/scream/roar.  In all my life I have never heard any animal sound that could match it in intensity  volume  and it just sounded plain angry and vivacious. It is hard to describe just how loud it was and how stunned we all were that this was coming from an animal just inside the tree line.  There were coyotes  owls  foxes galore back there and the sounds they made were a world away in comparison. We all immediately looked at each other  got up and went into the house as fast as we could without saying a word. Everyone assumed it was an animal but after reading about and hearing recordings of presumed Sasquatch scream and howls it brought the memory rushing back because it is so similar to what we heard. Anyway  just wanted to send this in as I saw there was another report for this area. Best regards ,Take Route 9 through Belchertown and enter Federal street via either entrance as it is a road that turns off Rt 9  runs for about 3-4 miles then ends again at another intersection of Rt 9.

2026,Approx. summer of 2000  I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe  MA (Franklin County) with my wife  sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods  about 100 yards away  walking towards us.  As it got closer  it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter  I at first told her not to worry  it  s a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer  my ears and experience told me that this was a biped  only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more. Fast Forward to 2006  I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield  MA.  I remember I was running a little late  so I was probably speeding  and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont  at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension  there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.  It was about 6  maybe 6 and a half feet tall  had long brown hair all over it  s body  and was stock still.  I drive this route almost daily (or nightly  in my case) for over 12 years  I know what belongs and what doesn  t.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back  and it was gone.  Being late for work  I turned around again and went to work.  I have never had any doubt that I saw a Sasquatch.  I haven  t reported it because I don  t want people to think I am a crackpot.  I just recently told my father about it  who told me to look into any organizations such as yours. ,See my post  near MP 410 on the railroad track  overhead route 2 bridge ,Franklin,23,Massachusetts ,MA,Summer ,25011,yes
2027,On this day  myself  a friend  Eddy and 2 girls  felt like taking a ride. Before I begin I just want it noted that there was NO drinking or the use of drugs. We decided to go to Plum Island. At the time  the refuge was free to enter and the entire road was dirt. That day there was no one in the refuge  as we drove down the road   I noticed no cars the entire 6.3 miles of the refuge  it was empty  we drove to the end.  At the last small area to park  I pulled in  across the road was a narrow boardwalk that lead to a 50 foot observation tower. We all went up. We hung around up there for about a half hour  I started hearing noises  first I heard clicking  loud clicking  then short high pitched screams  it sounded maybe 100 yards away. I took a look around  but didnâ€™t see anything.  I noticed there was no one in the area.  I saw no birds or waterfowl.  The sounds went on for about 10 minutes or so  I felt uneasy at this point and said we should go. We all got in my car and started back out. I was only driving for a couple of minutes and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road from the marsh/brush area on the left to the right  which had heavy brush and that lead to the beach.  I immediately looked at Eddy and asked â€œdid you see that?â€  He answered â€œYes!â€ We asked each other what it was. The girls in the back seat didnâ€™t see anything s they were to busy talking to each other. I slowed to almost a stop where what we saw it cross the road  there was solid brush that it went into  we could see where something went through the brush. There was no sign of  it  it was gone. The figure that crossed was huge  7 feet or more  very wide  all black from head to toe. It was a little hunched forward as it walked upright. I noticed its arms were longer than average and they swung as it walked.  It took only three steps to cross the road. The road is about three cars wide. It had a smooth stride. It did not look in my direction   just crossed the road and it was gone. I only saw it for about 5 seconds I could never forget the image of it crossing the road. I went back there today  my children wanted to see where I had the sighting.  I didnâ€™t make back up the observation tower because of these flies that nest in the marsh  they are Green Headed Flies  they are  as the woman in the office said  â€œman eatersâ€.  They bite hard. As you drive down the road  they follow the car  dozens fly around the car. So the kids didnâ€™t want to get out and get eaten by them and neither did I  so I didnâ€™t get up on the observation tower to take a look. I have told a few people what I saw and they think Iâ€™m nuts.  My father looks at me strange because he knows I donâ€™t make up stories like this  I donâ€™t lie  so he just looks at me when I talk about it to him. I know what I saw  and I saw what I saw. ,The sighting was in the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge in Plum Island.

2029,In 1977-78 I lived in Sandwich in a development called [removed by editor]. We were the last house in the neighborhood  behind us was woods that ran for a mile or more in each direction.  One snowy Saturday I was home alone watching television.  My parents worked frequently and even though I was only 11-12 years old I was at home alone alot.  I was watching TV in our den which was situated between 2 windows.  It was around noon and overcast. My dog frequently barked whenever a car drove up.  When she started barking this time  I turned my head down our hallway to yell at her to shut up.  Looking back to the TV  I was startled to see a face peering through my window.  To the best of my memory  the face was fury  whatever it was it only around 5-6 feet tall.  I screamed and it made some kind of grunting noise.  It immediately took off around the back of the house  running on two legs  and through an open breeze way to the front and into the woods. To say I was frightened was an understatement.  I immediately called some friends who came over to calm me down. After thinking about it for a while I thought it could have been one of my friends wearing a mask and playing a joke on me. That theory ended when we went outside to see what the creatures footprints looked like  we were shocked to see hoofed footprints.  I never saw any sign of this creature again  but after reading what the men in Mashpee saw 2-3 years later  it sounds like Cape Cod might have a Bigfoot of some kind. , ,Barnstable,2,Massachusetts ,MA,Winter ,25001,yes
2030,In the Fall of 1980 or 1981 two coworkers at Niel Brown Instrument Systems in Cataumet  Mass. (now defunct) observed a tall dark hair covered bipedal creature with a black dog at the entrance to Lowdens Garden Center on Rte. 151 in the town of Mashpee  Mass. The incident occured at 2 00am-3 00am. The garden center is now the entrance to a small housing developement. Both witnesses were extremely sincere about what they had seen. They described their reaction to seeing the creature as extreme shock  and they drove off at high speed. Mashpee is on Cape Cod a peninsula on the northeast coast of the U.S. It is about 1000 square miles in extent  and the area where the sighting occurred is adjacent to the largest tract of forest on Cape Cod. This forest area is south of and adjacent to Camp Edwards an Army training base. Cape Cod is completely surrounded by water and is connected to the mainland by two bridges.

2031,It was in the middle of summer (apx late July  1989) when I was hiking a well established trail on October mountain. I was approaching the top of the mountain (apx 1200 feet above sea level) when I observed a slight glimps of a moving object about 100 yards ahead of me. October mountain is a heavily wooded area and it was very difficult to see clearly because of all the low brush and scrub. At first all I could see were arms moving and an occassional glimps of a fur covered body. At first I thought I was looking at a large black bear which are not uncommon in the area. I pulled a pair of 40 power biocculars from my travel pack and attempted to focus on the object. Again it was difficult because of all the brush  at one point the animal moved into a slight clearing  it was then that I realized I was observing something very unusual! The animal was very tall (cannot accurately approximate the size) and slightly stooped. Its body was massive and covered completely with reddish hair. I noticed that the head was also very unusual in shape and size. The head was rather pointed and covered with hair or fur. The face was dark in color and had less hair than the top of the head. The neck seemed to be non-existant. At that moment it turned toward me and I was absolutely shocked  it looked very human. At this point I was so frightened  that I took measures to hide myself. After getting over my initial chill I continued to study the animal. It was still in the small clearing and seemed very occupied. It was moving stones and small peices of wood and grubbing for either roots or insects  it was simply to far away for me to see exactly what it was eating. I could see its large arm moving to its mouth every so often. What really took me by suprize was that it was stacking rocks after moving them. One on top of another. This is when I thought perhaps this animal was infact a human  why would it stack rocks in this way? At this point I wanted to get a little closer to see if it was a man in a fur coat or a monkey suit. I checked the wind and made an effort to stay down wind of the animal. I was able to get about 20 yards or so closer to the animal. I found a good observation area and studied the animal closer. At this point I could planly see that this was something very strange indeed  it was not human. The arms were to long and the face seemed very distored and elongated. The arms extended past the nee caps! The hands were very large but human in shape. The fur seemed to be tipped with a lighter color of red. I became so frightened at this point that I began to run back to the trail. I looked back at one point and noticed that the animal had its head back and was slowly moving back into the forest. I don  t think it was aware of me  though I wonder how it could have missed hearing me running through the underbrush. I was frightened severly for several weeks and would not hike in that area of the mountain without a hiking partner and a rifle. I will never forget what I saw...never! No way it was a bear or any other forest animal found in this part of the country. ,October Mountain State forest  Lenoxdale Massachusetts  USA ,Berkshire,8,Massachusetts ,MA,Summer ,25003,yes
2032,Over the past several months I have heard knocks in the woods behind my house. I live in the Berkshires in MA on a wooded 6 acre lot that borders a very mountainous area with over 100 undeveloped acres. In addition  I have had some rocks being thrown at night while I have been on my back porch. My most recent occurrence was a few week ago while standing on my back porch I heard some noises nearby in the woods.I scanned the area with my high intensity flashlight and saw some eye shine about 40 yards into the woods. I stared at it for a while and then the animal turned and moved deeper into the woods. I subsequently estimated that the eyes would have been on something at least 7-8 feet tall.   In addition  my wife and I have heard knocks in the past and they even responded to my knocks on one occasion last fall. , ,Berkshire,8,Massachusetts ,MA,Winter ,25003,no
2033,On Saturday Sept 5th of 2015  my wife and I were driving north in our RV on route 7 very close to the Vermont state line. It was about 1 00 in the afternoon. My wife saw an animal on the west side of the road. The animal was about 50 yards from the edge of the highway. What caught her attention was that the animal was walking upright. It was very tall ( well over seven feet ). The animal  s fur was black. It was most definitely not a bear. We are both mystified as to what this animal could possibly be.

2034,I have hiked the Appalachian Trail Georgia to Hanover NH ( 2006-Present )  I am a section hiker. While staying at The Tom Leonard Selter East Mtn State Park Mass.I  had an incident. While solo camping at the shelter I decided to call a big foot in. Or try  it was a erie evening  i went to get water it was a long way down. While I had a feeling something was watching me. It was getting dark...uneventfully I hiked back. I made a big fire that lasted for three hours  made alot of noise. Did a couple Bigfoot calls. A whoop whoop type. A wood knock ( no return ). A local plane saw my smoke and buzzed right over my camp site. After a great meal  some singing  i went to bed on the TOP bunk. I always sleep with one eye and ear open. At 2 30am I heard a solid Wood Knock followed immediatley by a tree gettintg pushed over. It did not crash . It sounded dead and not tall...   Wood Knock then a Thud    after that nothing. 1/2 hour later I was back to sleep. ,South Of Tyringham  Mass north of Great Barrington Mass ,Berkshire,8,Massachusetts ,MA,Fall ,25003,no
2035,We had a large rock thrown at us while we were hiking on October Mountain.

2037,Hello  I have been a believer that Big Foot exist for years just based on how many people have reported seeing or hearing something over hundreds of years.  I am 64 years old and have been hiking and camping ever since I was about 12 years old and I have seen and heard many things in the woods. On February 27  2016  my friend Dean and I set out for an over night camping trip in Mt Washington State Forest in Mass.  You can watch the 8 min video on my blog if you like. www.hikingwithtom.com I always record our adventures on video but this time I decided to run an MP3 recorder all night and get the sounds of the night  I did get what I think was a bobcat walking up to my tent but around 2 AM I was awake again because it was very cold and hard to sleep. I was only half awake when I heard a real loud noise but not awake enough to really tell what it was except that it was a good ways off  I knew I was recording audio so I noted the time so I could find it on my recorder and went back to sleep  or at least I tried too. When I got home I found the sound on my MP3 recorder and it sounds a lot like a wood knock but judging by the amount of echo and how loud it was from so far away It had to be something real big that made that noise. I do not think even Babe Ruth could swing a bat fast and hard enough to make that sound.    The sound is int the video my blog. www.hikingwithtom.com  It sounded like it was a good half mile a way..

2038,My wife and I started to make our descent from the summit of Mount Greylock during a morning hike.  Approximately half a mile on the Cheshire Harbor Trail  close to Rockwell Rd  my wife and I heard a clapping sound.  We stood in place for a few moments  listening to the sound.  The  clapping  was non-rhythmic  sometimes there was one or two  other times there were many  claps .  In between the  claps  there was sounds of something walking  breaking fallen branches as it moved.  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail  within a thicker patch of woods.  We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail  moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.  Further down the trail I attempted figure out the sound.  I did some tree knocking and banged rocks together  but only when I clapped my hands did it most closely match the sound my wife and I had heard.  It was a sound that I have never heard before and it has sparked my interest into figuring out what animal made this noise. ,Mount Greylock State Reservation  Cheshire Harbor Trail off West Mountain Rd  Adams  MA  heading southeast toward base of trail.

2039,I and my girlfriend were riding in my Jeep on Route 140 from New Bedford to Freetown tonight (July 14  2009) and at about 11 00 my girlfriend seen this large brown hair covered  man  standing up from a crouched position on the side of the two lane highway. She lets out a scream prompting me to look at the creature standing there. He made fluid movements like a man and had an almost ape-like quality. We couldn  t see his face but upon returning to the area we saw the  man  there was nothing. After calling 911 and telling them that someone was running in the median of the highway they told us that they had similar reports of what we saw on the stretch of highway between exit 7 (Braley rd.) and exit 8 (Chase Rd.) They then told me that they were sending state troopers to investigate. ,Between exits 7 (Braley Rd New Bedford) and 8 (Chase Rd.) ,Bristol,2,Massachusetts ,MA,Summer ,25005,yes
2040,Hi  my name is xxxxxx  I grew up in Rowley  MA.. a small old farming town established in 1639.. when I was 10  I  m now 27  my friend an I were attempting to find a way through the woods from his home street to a plaza containing a dunkin donuts for the fun of it. like I said  I grew up in the woods and this is only a distance of about a half of a mile. We started out heading in the direction we thought was good and after a while we heard a noise in the distance.. at this point we were pretty deep into just new England forest when we heard something. in the distance.. (far enough to be a hard definite sighting but close enough to be odd as hell to this day) so we looked obviously and in the middle of the woods.. randomly.. were three.. THREE  tanned brown.. (not brown black  or brown brown  but brown tan) upright creatures  running through the woods together. AS IF THEY WERE TRAVELING!!!! they were close and tight and jogging along on the hill we were on about 400 yards away.. we just watched speechless and then decided it was time to give up on finding our way and head back. I don  t know if he told anyone ever  but we lost touch over the years  but that sighting will forever connect us.. I just thought anyone who follows bigfoot should know about this.. these 3 creatures were tanned and brown  upright  jogging in a line  and fully unclothed.. I  ve seen one other unexplained sighting  but this one was absolutely dumbfounded.. I don  t know if anyone has ever seen multiple bigfoots traveling together but I have. ,We were on a big hill where we could see a big power line field runway downhill to route 133  but somewhere in the forest between the Rowley plaza on Newburyport Turnpike and Christopher road ,Essex,14,Massachusetts ,MA,Summer ,25009,yes
2041,I parked up the road a ways so any cops or ranger patrols didn  t see my car. It was 1am with a 3/4 moon. The water was very low this day. I was fishing and there was about 4 Beaver-Tail slaps on the water so I knew there would  nt be any smallies hanging around. I took a few more casts and caught a Dace. Its like a sucker with the body of a trout. Very silver in color and unedible. I was trying to get the fish off my hooks when I heard something heavy about 45 yrds away from me cracking sticks as it approached from the road onto the freshly cut brush (from the work they did around there  days prior). It sounded like a human walking  and I thought I was in trouble with the law. My flashlight was dying and I was having trouble seeing just getting the fish off my 2 treble hooks. I asked   Who  s There?!?!  and I just heard a stick snap really loud as it stood still. I hit my flashlight in order to make it brighter and I seen big eyeshine and a dark sillouette of what looked to be shoulders. I started yelling at it to get out of here and at this point  I  m thinking deer... or worse  maybe a bear standing up. I heard a few more big snaps as it walked onto the paved road and that  s when it cried out in this terrible noise that I  ve never heard before. It echoed thru the mountains and it scared the bajesus out of me. It wasn  t a bear  or a deer  that  s for sure. It was huge  and the sound it made sounded like a shrieking demon baby. That  s the only way I could describe it. A loud shrieking howl. It wasn  t a roar or a deep growl. It was more high pitched. I cut my line with the lure still in the fishes mouth and kicked the fish half hazardly into the water and ran as fast as I could to my car which was the scariest run/walk/stop & listen journey to my car I  ve ever encountered in my life. I was waiting for a werewolf to jump out and get me or something. True terror that I  ve never experienced to this day. ,After 9-11  the government closed the thru-way that runs along side the reservoir that feeds Springfield its water supply.

My Uncle  worked at the Pumping Station  he let me and my cousins fish there. I stayed there for weeks at a time. As an adult  I couldn  t help myself to go fishing there still.   I respected the land and put all fish back and wouldn  t throw any trash around. I packed it up and brought it back with me. I fished there all day sometimes but mostly at night with top-water poppers for Small-Mouth bass. Fun fun! ,Hampden,2,Massachusetts ,MA,Fall ,25013,yes
2042,Westfield   MA 3am Couldn  t sleep and went outside to have a cigarette. Heard howls in the distance that I never heard before. I  ve worked as a wilderness counselor for the past 10 years and heard all sorts of animal noises in the night foxes  coyotes  owls etc.. This sound had a lack of clarity but power in its voice. I knew that it came from a long distance away. I remember listening to Bigfoot calls years back and on a hunch ran inside found the EXACT same howls on the net sounded like the Snohomish  WA 1978-79 calls. I woke up my friend who has been hunting western mass for 30 years and he said he never heard anything like it. He heard it and he said it gave him the chills. The howls trailed off as if he creature was moving. Incident lasted for about 10 minutes. I google mapped the area the sound came from and its a huge swath of wilderness that stretches into Vermont and south into Connecticut. ,Calls came from south west of Westwood Dr. ,Hampden,2,Massachusetts ,MA,Winter ,25013,no
2043,Hiking the Seven Sisters Trail from Mt Holyoke to the Notch in the Hadley / Amherst area of Massachusetts. My hiking partner and I got to Taylor  s Notch and could hear the wind ripping through making eerie noises. We both heard a lot of whistling  and breaking branches which I initially attributed to the wind going through the rocky ledges of Taylor  s Notch. We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so. Not sure what it was but highly unusual and did not sound like a grown or baby bear canine  coyote  mountain lion  or fox. I frequently hike and spend time outdoors. I am at a loss as to what was with us that day. I am going back soon to see if I can find more. ,The Seven Sisters is a group of Peaks within the Holyoke Mountain Range. ,Hampshire,3,Massachusetts ,MA,Summer ,25015,no
2044,Twenty Five years ago (1979) I heard the most awful and terrifying screams for 3 nights in a row. We had just built a two story addition which is situated further back on a lot (about 150 feet) into the woods from the street. This area was considered suburban but was fairly rural at that time. There are houses built along the street that are on lots of 3/4 to 1 acre. We own several acres of heavily wooded land and our house sits back on the lot further than the others. The section of woods is borderd by 3 state highways and was about 1 mile (length) by 1 1/2 miles (width)of woods and some farmland fields. At the time there were only two dead end streets that penetrated this section of woods. Another country road separates this section on the west with a State park nearby (1/2 mile from the road). This park is several hundred acres of lakes and heavily wooded areas. The area now is filled with housing and development. It was July and was very hot (90 degrees +) and the peepers were very loud. Each evening between 2 00 and 3 30 a.m. an extremely loud howling  screaming sound would start far away. As it came closer ( the screams lasted for 20-30 seconds each and occurred every 1-2 minutes or so) you could hear bushes and branches being swept out of the way with loud crunching and breaking sounds and screams that would get louder in intensity. The woods at that time were covered with thick vines and brambles that were about 3-5 feet high. It was extremely difficult to walk through any section of the woods that was not cleared. You just didn  t stroll through the woods  especially in the pitch black. When this  thing  came closer all the peepers and the night sounds completely ceased. The sound was so loud in volume that it actually caused you to  freeze  - I mean that it ran your blood cold!  I remember laying in bed not wanting to investigate because whatever it was - it was BIG and I did not want to find out what it was! It was not the sound of a bear  a mountain lion or a wounded deer.The sound had a human quality about it and was like - it was searching for something and had a sense of pain or distress abut it. It would travel parallel through the woods about 100 feet behind my house. On the third night I got up immediately and waited for this thing to get closer. I have a switch in the bedroom that would turn on some roof mounted flood lights that would shine in the back yard. We did not have a deck or anything at the time and the woods were about 25 feet behind the house. This thing was crashing through the woods and when it was right behind the house it gave out this huge loud moan. I was looking out the window with all the inside lights out and then I turned on the floodlights. The scream stopped and there was silence for about 5 seconds and then it crashed through the woods away from the house very quickly opposite the direction it came from. You could hear the crashing of a two footed creature. I heard the crashing sounds for about another minute and then it faded and was quiet. I was really spooked and went downstairs and started turning on all the lights and the outside lights. I noticed that all my neighbors were turning on their outside lights as well. This was unusual because no one left outside lights on and there were no street lights in this section of the street.There were at least 4 other houses that turned their lights on. I contemplated whether to call the police but did not. The next day while mowing the lawn  my elderly neighbor across the street from me came over and said  Dave  did you hear those sounds last night? I have heard them for several nights and almost called the cops - if I hear it again I am calling the police - I never heard anything like that in my life.  I agreed and it was good that someone else confirmed the incident to me. All these years I have only told close friends of this story and the kidding I take is unmerciful- but I know to this day what I heard was absolutely real. I forgot about it for many years until I saw some  bigfoot  documentary in the early 1990  s. They played a recording and when I heard it- it brought back the whole incident. It was almost identical to the sound! I have played the sound recordings on various websights and would say that it was pretty close to the Ohio or Pennsylvania recordings. I never heard anything after 1979 and I did not see anything. Perhaps others have given reports from this area and this report may be helpful. I am being truthful about this - I do not drink or do any nonprescription drugs - I am a church administrator in a Bible (nondenominational) church. ,[Address removed from the report] ,Plymouth,5,Massachusetts ,MA,Summer ,25023,no
2045,My dog was bothering me to go out ealry morning around 3 AM on November 25th 2000. It was very brisk out and I believe the weather was clear. Not sure about the lighting. As I was walking her  I could hear coyotes howling for a good few minutes from a distance and didn  t think much of it. Then a few minutes later after it had stopped  I was about to walk inside and heard this loud wailing coming from the woods. It literally sent a chill down my spine. It definitely was not human and not anything else I would recognize. We don  t have much wildlife bigger than deer and coyote. This went on till about 5 30 AM and kept me up. The wailing to me almost sounded depressing like it was upset or something. I told my friend  s father a few weeks later and he told me that he was out walking his dog a few years earlier and said that he clearly saw something in the woods watching him. He never told anyone because he thought no one would be lieve him. This happened across the major road by the resevoir early evening. ,Between 3A and Old Oaken Bucket Road in the woods that separates them. ,Plymouth,5,Massachusetts ,MA,Fall ,25023,yes
2046,It was a mild day and I decided to take a walk in the woods. After traveling about 5 or 10 minutes down a woods road I heard 3 deliberate and distinct knocks which emanated about 50 yards away from inside the brush off to my left  it stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read many of the incidents on BFRO and I could not believe what I was hearing. I composed my self and found what I considered a sturdy stick and struck a large pine tree close by in the same manner as I had just heard. It took about 5 seconds and a reply came back but only 2 deliberate knocks this time. A couple of seconds later  another sound came from a direction parallel  to the first but about 50 yards apart. This sound was like a tree being struck but with the stick breaking on impact. When the stick broke it sounded like it had a girth of a couple of inches. I struck my tree 3 more times but nothing more happened. Let me add that as I was strolling down this trail I was smoking a cigar and the wind was blowing into the direction that the knocks came from.  I continued down the trail which takes you to the edge of a pond. While exploring there I found an interesting thing. Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be  it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture. There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree  the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole. I believe that this club dug both holes because of the way the end was all rounded and imbedded with dirt. But I do not understand why. I decided to go back the next day for photographs and I brought a yard stick with me to get these measurements. When returning  the next day I discovered a good size pile of feces on the trail about 15 feet away from the tree I had knocked on. Nothing unusual took place this day but I did take a few pictures of various other things as well which may or may not be relevant. What or who  made those knocks I will probably never know but be clear on this they were distinct  clear  timed and deliberate  of this I am sure. ,The closest intersection would be Walnut Street and Marion Road.

2047,I was driving near the town dump about 1 00 in the afternoon around the end of June last year  it was raining very hard  a large figure came out of nowhere  I hit my brakes but was far enough back that I would not have hit it  there was a car coming at me the other way  it almost ran into the back end of that car  it turned a little sideways to avoid the car  that  s when I knew it was not a person or a bear  when it turned it flung its arm up and back a little to miss the car  it was a little hunched over  its shoulders were extremely wide  I couldn  t make out any facial features  it was covered in dark brown hair and appeared to have hardly any neck  it was about 6  taller than the mini van it almost ran into  if it was standing straight up I would guess it was about 6 to 6 and a half feet tall. The whole thing only took about 2 or 3 seconds but it really shook me up. I have always hiked in the woods around here and done a lot of tracking animals of all kinds  I have never seen anything that would resemble a bigfoot track  I have always had doubts about people seeing these  but now I will never doubt it again. It won  t keep me from the woods but I  ll keep an eye peeled from now on. ,I haven  t even told anyone about this because I didn  t want this guy harassed or bothered.

2048,On April 2015 I was clicking on some YouTube videos when I came across one from my own town. It was a small town radio interview with a mother and daughter that were coon hunting at night in an area that I know well and they had a class A encounter. I told my son about it and he took a walk in the area a couple of days later. He called me and told me that he came across a structure that must have been built by boy scouts or something. I went in to check it a couple of days later and took some very good photos of it and some of the surrounding area. I returned to the area again today 08/13/2015 to check the structure and took more photos which I can send. ,(this should not be posted) ,Plymouth,5,Massachusetts ,MA,Spring ,25023,no
3231,My two children and I were returning from Altus   Oklahoma to Burns Flat  Oklahoma in the fall of 1973 when a very large black man-like creature crossed the highway moving from west to east. I was driving and my son (age 11) was sitting in the front seat beside me and my daughter (age 12) was sitting in the back seat leaning forward between the driver and passenger seat. It was a clear sunny day about 3 PM and there was a lull in the conversation. It was quiet in the car  we did not have the radio on and all three of us were happened to be looking straight ahead. I noticed a movement on the left side of the road and was amazed to see a what I percieved to be a very large black man-like creature rise from a squatting position and run across the two lane highway about 30 yards ahead. It ran across the highway  covering the distance in only three steps  I estimate the creature to have been at least 8 feet tall  it glanced briefly in the direction of the car and I instictively applied the brake so as not to hit it. It ran into the bar ditch on the east side of the road and ducked into some brush and large bushes between the ditch and the barbed wire fence. It had hair that looked rather silky as it ran  I remember seeing the hair move as it ran. The hair did not appear to be stiff like an animals hair but more soft and shiny. Both children saw it too and said  What was that  mama?  I said I didn  t know  they wanted me to stop the car  but I was frightened that my children and I could be harmed by something I had never seen before in my life. I didn  t tell anyone what I had seen and cautioned the children not to say anything either. ,The creature crossed from one cattle pasture to another  it may have been leaving a pond on the east side of the highway. ,Washita,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40149,yes
3232,I had 2 girlfriends spending the night. It was a hot summer evening and we were laying across the bed  instead of with our heads by the headboard  with the window open to catch the breeze. We were talking and laughing  as young girls do  looking out the window occasionally. Approximately midnight  we had settled down some and were just quietly talking about what we had done that day. My mother and sister were sleeping in an adjacent bedroom and we were trying not to wake them. We heard something outside and the three of us raised up to see if we could determine what it was. First it was just footsteps we heard  then the bushes in front of the window moved  shook  and then a large hair covered face rose in the window. The head was huge and my first thought was that it was an ape but realized it wasn  t. My two friends rolled away from the window and began crying. I was so completely frozen with fear that I could not move. There was only a screen and a few inches separating me from this creature and I live to this day with that face etched in my memory. The eyes especially  staring directly at me and the smell of something musky. I slowly was able to move and turned and began screaming hysterically. My mother ran to the room turned the light on  we ran out to the living room. We began describing the creature to her and she called the police.  They came to our house  searched the area and never found a thing. The experience changed me forever. I tell all of my grandchildren this story and one of my grandsons encouraged me to put this on the web. So here it is. The description of bigfoot  that I have heard over the last few years  fit the creature I saw face to face and I will never forget it. ,On the edge of town  new housing.

3233,It was 1987  I was 17. Me and my friend were going to the airport in Frederick  Oklahoma (Tillman county). My friend  s dad owned a helicopter manufacturing plant that was located at the airport a few miles south of town.  We were going to get some paperwork for a trip we were taking during spring break. It was about 9 pm or later. It was dark. There is an access road that leads to the hanger which is at the south end of the airport. I believe the field on the passenger side of the van (my side) was a plowed field. Me and my friend were talking and I saw something out of my peripheral vision in my window.  There are various lights scattered out there on buildings and such but mostly very dark. At first I thought it was a reflection from the inside of the van when I glanced. Then I turned my head to look and there it was. I would say approximately 15 to 20 yards directly to my right striding our speed it seemed easily. I would guess it was 20 mph . It has been a long time so forgive my accuracy.  I would say maybe it was a bear or something else if it wasn  t so clear to me what I was looking at. It looked just like the majority of the pictures and clips I  ve seen over the years. Almost identical to the really popular ones  like the one that gets all the press where it is striding across the open area in kind of rocky terrain. And almost just like that clip as I was looking trying to come to terms with what I  m looking at  while it is running it turns its head and is looking at me.  Dark black hair  it seems to me the face was dark like the hair. but being dark it is hard to say for sure. The whole face wasn  t covered  I could make out some features because I remember a kind of indifferent expression on its face as we were staring at each other.  It had the same kind of gait as the video of one on the beach and seemed not to be laboring to run as fast as he was.  I could not even talk. My friend did not see it. We got to the hanger which was about 1/4 mile down the access road in the same direction it was going  that is when my friend knew I was serious. I would not get out of the van to go in to get the paperwork and told him that I  m going to leave him if I see the thing. We decided to come back the next day. The airport is very secluded. Mostly flat fields  a couple of creeks with treelines but overall flat and open. But the Red River is only 4 or 5 miles and I could see him there but I dont know why it would venture to where he was. I don  t know if this will help but I just saw a show on bigfoot and thought what the heck. I have only told 5 or 6 people in 25 years. I think I would rather of seen a UFO though  the looks you get when you say  I saw a bigfoot . ,It  s been a long time  if you need specifics I can find out.

3235,In the fall of 1974  my father and I were driving the backroads on a rainy  wet and cold day  looking for deer.  We stopped at an intersection and my Father made the comment  What in the world.   We carried a deer rifle with a high-powered scope and my Father placed the rifle on a sand bag over the drivers side mirror and looked through the scpoe with his mouth open and told me  you have got to see this. I took the rifle placed on the passenger side mirror and watched in amazement as a creature stood in the distance pulling leaves off a tree that hung over the dirt road on which it was standing.   My father asked what I thought and my first thought was It  s a bear but  as I watched I realized a bear did not have long arms that could reach 3 feet over it  s head.  To our amazement 2 smaller creatures joined the other creature  playing in the water that had collected in puddles on the dirt road.  The smaller creatures were waist high to the larger and ran and played as the larger creature pulled the leaves from the branch above it. To this day I  m not certain how long we watched but  I remember I slept with my light on the the next several days.  At the time we did not get any closer than maybe 1/4 of a mile.  We were in agreement that the rifle we had did not appear to be adequate protection if we were closer to this creature.  A week later we found enough courage to to drive to the exact spot where we had seen the creature.  The branch that the creature had been pulling leaves from was over 11 feet in the air.  (That ensures it was no bear.)    We have told 1 or 2 people that we know and they think we are - well  full of it. ,The area had very few homes at the time and the road was lightly traveled. ,Seminole,5,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40133,yes
3236,My sighting happened on November 21  2002  on or about 7 30am in Catoosa  Rogers County  Oklahoma. I work in a dental office  and happened to look out of the window and saw what I automatically knew was a bigfoot/sasquatch  walking beside an abandoned house. It was very dark brown or nearly black  thick neck with broad shoulders and had a wide skull  it was at least 7ft.tall. I only saw the backside of the animal. I can best describe it as primate looking animal that stood more upright than a gorilla but somewhat stooped  it slowly swung its arms  and had a slight knee bend. ,1755 NORTH HIGHWAY 66  CATOOSA  OKLAHOMA ,Rogers,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40131,yes
3237,Date  Friday  September 30  1983 The night before opening day of bow season  I arrived in the camp at approximately 4 30 pm. I began clearing an area to set up base camp for a total of three hunters who were joining me. I had been clearing out the area of Johnson grass for about 15 minutes when I heard large impact sounds approximately 25 feet to the north of me. It was way too heavy to be a deer. I stood there and heard three large impacts with a second or so in-between sounds. The grass and trees were too thick to see any movement. I continued to work on base camp. I had forgotten my ax and had begun breaking wood over wood for the campfire  when I started hearing rustling in the brush  again to the north of me. I also noticed movement south of me. This movement was different  and I thought it was possibly deer. Three to five minutes later I began having the feeling of being watched  and it was starting to get dark. I made a fire and waited for the other two men to arrive. My friend  Iâ€™ll call him RL  arrived around 8 00pm. We were sitting around the fire and I noticed RL kept looking behind him  and seemed uneasy. I asked him what was wrong. He said he had a feeling we are being watched. I had not said anything to him about the events of the evening. I told him that I had had a creepy feeling of being watched for over three hours. I was glad to have him validate what I had been feeling. The other hunter  MR  arrived around 8 30pm. While we were sitting around the campfire we smelled a dirty  sweaty  skunk-ish smell  that came and went. It seemed to emanate from the south. We called it a night. MR  and I went in my camper. RL relieved himself in the woods and when he came back into the camper he was white as a sheet  and had a shocked look on his face. I asked him what was the matter and he said heâ€™d seen eye shine.  I didnâ€™t understand what the problem was  and replied that it was probably deer. He said  â€œNo you donâ€™t understand. Itâ€™s not deer eye shine I saw. It was large  red  and taller than me!â€ I asked him about the possibility that it could have been a deer standing on a berm and he said no it was all flat river bottom. Saturday  October 1  1983 The next morning while I was in my tree stand I heard three wood knocks to my west  about 5 minutes later I heard a really loud  like a small caliber rifle going off  tree snap and then the sound of splintering wood  like a branch was being ripped off. We met at base camp after the morning hunt  and RL was upset because he heard people talking down his deer trail  he couldnâ€™t understand what they were saying. He also heard a whistle. Late morning the three of us were stalk hunting and I noticed something odd. I observed three red cedars that were bent over at the 8 to 10 foot level  all pointing to the northwest. No other cedars in the area looked like these. The next thing I ran across was something that looked like a nest made of small tree branches. 9 feet long and 6 or 7 feet wide  piled knee high on me. This nest like thing was underneath a hardwood tree. Beside the nest were two little shelters that were â€˜pup tentâ€™ shaped. One was 3ft long the other was 5ft long  and they were about two and a half feet tall. The grass had grown back through the bottom of them  and the leaves were dried out. It looked like whatever made these things had not used them for 6 or 7 months. I thought maybe some Boy Scouts might have made them  but there were no strings  or twine to hold them together and all the branches had been snapped off and not cut with a saw. (I did ask the local scoutmaster if they take scouts into the area and they said no  they do not.) I continued to hunt  and 150 feet away from the nests I discovered a tree  12 to 14 inches in diameter  was broken at the 5 foot tall level  and leaned over against another tree. It looked level like it was at a 90 angle  and smaller trees were placed against it. At first I thought it was a wind break for cattle  but it was too small and the wind would go right through it. I looked for tracks of equipment  because two of the trees were too large for human to move  but found none. I had no idea what this could be. Later that evening we were stalk hunting again  the sun was going down  I was northwest of camp  I heard what sounded like a guy calling cattle. This guy had massive lungs  possibly a quarter mile away. But at the end of this extended vocal  was a loud whoop. The hair on the back of my neck stood up because it sounded ape-ish. It repeated this vocalization another time. When I arrived back at base camp I asked my friends if they had heard the sounds and they both had  and wondered what it was. About 3 00 am that night  I heard something being moved around  and knocked over  but I didnâ€™t investigate  as I was thinking it was raccoons. Sunday  October 2  1983 In my tree stand the next morning I heard mumbling south of me  it sounded like Asian foreigners talking. I also heard two whistles south of me  down a deer trail. At 3 00AM that night  I was jolted awake by a loud human sounding roar. It sounded like a combination of an African Lion  the T-Rex from Jurassic park  and a really pissed off human. It was a deep guttural sound. It was very angry. I could feel this sound vibrate in my chest. I think it came from the edge of camp. It roared again  same attitude. I could not believe my hunter friends did not wake up. Then suddenly from 50 to 100 yards away came another sound. This was totally unlike the roar. It sounded like a female being murdered  but also incredibly angry. At this point I woke up my friends  and we waited but there were no more sounds.  I have heard mountain lions since I was 6 years old. This sound nothing like what I heard that night. It took me an hour to go back to sleep  as thoughts came into my head of the possibility that these things could rip the pop-up camper apart.   Monday  October 3rd  1983 The next morning we went about looking for tracks. There was too much leaf litter though. We came upon a huge plum thicket  as I came around to the southwest side  I smelled a dirty  sweaty  skunk smell like we encountered on Friday night. I felt we needed to leave right then  as I felt whatever made that roar the night before was in there  and we would be in danger if we stayed or pressed into the thicket. We packed up and headed home. I was uncomfortable and ready to get out of there. At the time I had no experience with Bigfoot  and only came to realize these events were Bigfoot related when I heard the extended â€˜whoopâ€™ vocalization. I had heard Paul Harvey speak about such encounters on the radio  years ago  telling about stories from the three country area of Dewey  Roger Mills and Ellis Counties. I didnâ€™t talk about this weekend with anybody for almost thirty years.   ,7.5 miles north of Reydon  OK ,Roger Mills,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40129,no
3238,I was eight years old and we just moved to the country  that had lots of wood all around the house. We had a little camper I played in. I had several chihuahuas and a rottwieller. Well one day I was playing in the camper and the dogs were barking running just a little ways from were I was. I decided to follow them. What came after was cute. It was a little fawn. I was going to chase it but [I saw] this huge  smelly  8  foot tall  red mud clay color thing (as little as I was I thought it was a tall man until I hollered hey who are you. He looked at me and his face was so ugly and scary I knew then he wasnt a man. He stepped right over a 5  5 fence. The little fawn ran right under it. He didnt catch fawn. I was in shock and I couldnt speak so my dad told me to draw what I saw. He said it look similar to a Sasquatch. That deer season my dad was deer hunting. He had a deer right next to him. He was about to shoot him and he heard something coming toward him the buck ran off. Dad stood up and yelled you scared my deer off your on my land. He heard a high pitched sound like a lion and a bull mixed together and heard branches breaking over his head. He ran to the house and got both my brothers  they each got a gun. My mom called the sheriff and he thought it was a prank but they sent a deputy anyway when he heard those sounds he said call me if you kill it and left. Now it was dark the sun had set so they gave up. The rest of the night it paced back and forth making that high pitch sound. ,One Half mile east of S.Canadian River heavily wooded area  a lot of deer and other game.

3239,My family and I were driving home early in the morning between 2 and 3 A.M. We took a shortcut down HW 63 which runs between Haleyville Ok and Kiowa  Ok. The Highway now is paved  but at the time of our encounter it was a well maintained dirt road. The road had many curves and hills. We were traveling around 40-50 mph. We crossed over a hill and right below the hill was a small bridge. On this bridge was a creature that was standing to the right of our pickup as we passed by. The creature was between 6-7 ft. tall and had brown shaggy hair all over it similar to an irish setter dog. As we passed  I looked at the creature right in the face. His face resembled that of an old man  s. More human than apelike. I could see that the creature  s face had wrinkles and very little hair around it  s eyes and nose. The creature had no neck and it looked as if his head was just plopped up on his shoulders. I felt like we surprised the creature and once he finally saw us  he had nowhere to go. I remember seeing him stand real stiff against the bridge  s railing as we passed. I asked my mother to turn around and see if we could get a better look at this mysterious creature. She replied No way!!  I asked her what she thought we saw  she replied I guess it was a bear.  I felt that it looked more like a man. She said that it was way to big to be a man. At the time of this incident  I had never heard of such thing as a bigfoot or sasquatch. Although we only got a quick glimpse of this creature  it couldn  t have been an illusion. We all felt that we saw the same thing. , ,Pittsburg,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40121,yes

3241,I was 16 years old. I am 33 now. Me an my three younger sisters was coming back from visiting our baby cousin was recently born. It was about 10 pm driving down the road headed back home. We see a figure walking down the side of the road just like causal. I mention to my sister in the front seat it  s awful late to be walking down a dark road without any type of lights. I slow down as i come up behind him. He stood about 9 to 10 feet tall with almost like a dark fur coat. He slowly turns his head and he had the evilest yellow eyes I have ever seen. By this time my younger sisters are in the back seat screaming an crying saying don  t stop Ernie. I proceed to lock the doors and speed off. To this day we all have the same story. My sister  s ages at the time is 15 8 6. ,The location is Ottawa county Oklahoma. About 5 miles from the Devils Promenade Bridge heading west.

3242,Alright me and some friends were camping out about 10 miles south of Barnsdall  Oklahoma and we had to run some girls to wooloroc to meet their ride. After we dropped them off we headed back south to Barnsdall  we were driving and something caught my eye on the side of the road.  I looked over and my friend was seeing the same thing. It was bent over in a ditch by a guardrail and was about 5 feet tall squatted down.  It was probably about 3 to 4 foot wide. As we passed it just kinda glanced over at us. This was happening around 1 00 a.m. that night. We were just blank minded and then finally decided to turn around and go back to see if we could still see it. But when we got back there we couldn  t find the creature. We back the next day and could only find flattened grass. ,about 1 mile south of wooloroc on highway 123 ,Osage,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40113,yes
3243,Winter  1982  On this occasion  there had been a big snowstorm  and nothing was moving on the streets.  There weren  t even any tire tracks.  I was about fifteen years old  and worked at a fast-food restaurant about a mile north of this location  and was forced to walk home because my father had called and told me that conditions were so bad he couldn  t get the car out of the drive.  The heavy blanket of snow made visibility good  reflecting light as it does.  As I cleared some trees to the east  I observed movement to my left through peripheral vision  and looked to my left into the ravine  and saw a figure apparently playing in the snow. For an instant  I thought that it was a child wearing a dark colored snow suit  but as the moment passed  I became very aware that this was no child.  I had a very clear view of it  and could see that it was black  or very close to black  and covered with long hair or fur from head to toe.  It was probably around five feet tall  and weighed about 160lbs. The creature continued playing in the snow  bending over at the waist  and throwing snow up into the air with both hands in a wide scooping motion  throwing it up so that it came back down on its head.  It also began rolling in the snow. I felt stark terror at the sight of the thing.  I was also very unnerved knowing that I was very far from any residential area  in the early morning  and that there was absolutely no traffic on the road. The creature was only about thirty to thirty-five yards from me  and I had about an eighth of a mile to clear until I was out of sight of the creature.  I thought about running  but I feared that my footfall and rapid motion would catch the thing  s attention and that it would then begin chasing me as is instinctive for a lot of animals. The point is  I had quite a bit of time to view this thing  and the longer I looked at it  the more I realized that what I was looking at did not fit any rational explanation.  Once I was out of sight  and I thought I was out of earshot  I ran as fast and as far as I could. This area is now a park  Hafer Park  but at the time  nothing was there but a wooded area and the ravine  which is a drainage ditch.  Even now  with the park  there is still a good deal of wooded area there. David A. Farris  author of  Mysterious Oklahoma   says that locals have dubbed this creature the  skunkape   reportedly because of its terrible odor.  I did not smell anything in this incident  but I have a very poor sense of smell and serious sinus and allergy problems which are routinely exasperated by the cold weather. ,Ravine at entrance to Hafer Park  at 9th and Bryant.

3244,This is a story I have been reluctant to even think about.  One night me and three other friends were in a storage shed located on the back of my friends property fetching things we needed.  We decided to head back to the house after we got what we came for and I was left behind attempting to latch the door because it was very old and hard to get it to fasten properly.  My three buddys had walked off at this time leaving me headed towards the house.  I was walking the exact same path they were taking actually more of a faster trot when I heard a noise like disturbed leaves to the left of me.  Curiously startled I stopped and looked in the direction of the noise and there it was.  Now at this location it happens to be at the back of the house and there is a chain link fence and about fifteen feet seperating me and this creature.  The thing I most remember is the size of this thing and the silouette of the creatures head to neck and shoulders.  Where a human has a visible neck line what I witnessed had not   but I did notice huge shoulder mucles too supernatural to be of anyone I  ve seen.  I didn  t notice how dense the hair on the body of this creature was so it could of added to the size of what I saw.  I didn  t mention this but there was only moonlight for me to see this by. Also this things abdomen was also tremendous and in a well defined v shape atop curvy big legs.  I have read some of the other reports and alot noticed a pungent odor but I did not and I believe that there was only fifteen feet at the most between me and this creature.  But what I did notice was a deep deep breathing sound and then a deep growl rumble like a cougar kind of intermitent if that makes sense and after that it promted me to slowly walk off out of fear.  This occurance only took about thirty to fortyfive seconds but I remember what I saw.  I never mentioned this to anyone until about a year later when my friend had told me about something strange that happend in the woods near the property. , ,Oklahoma,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40109,yes
3245,This evening  I decided to venture pass the communication building as the foliage was still at ease. I continued another Â½ mile up the path to where the powerlines cross the river  from here the river bank drops 15ft  giving a nice view of the river below. As I approached this area  my eyes were immediately caught by someone down below at the river edge. What I saw was an all-black figure down at the river edge about 250ft away. I thought it was strange because not many people hike off trail into the preserve during the summers nor late in the evening or even pass the communication building. As I watched this â€œmanâ€ down at the river bank  I started to notice settle detail like golden-red hair in the sunset. I also didnâ€™t notice any distinct clothing but hair alone. At this moment I remember being very confuse to what I was seeing. Whoever was down at the river  began to walk inland using itâ€™s arms to move the reed bushes. That I saw itâ€™s long hair dangling from its arm  shoulder to hand. â€œOmg  itâ€™s bigfootâ€ I thought. I immediately began to reach for my phone without taking my eyes off the creature  that is when it noticed me. What terrified me the most was not able to make out any details in the face as we made eye contact. That is when I ran. I continued to ran until I met a couple with their dog back at the communication building. I will never forget the look of confusion on their faces when I came sprinting around the corner. I wanted to tell them about my experience but I continued to run as I thought they would not believe me. The following day I returned to look for footprints but was unable to venture into the overgrown foliage. The experience was not enough to scary me away completely  instead I was more cautious of the time of day and surroundings. I continued to exercise at Stinchcomb until I moved to AZ in July 2019. ,When I lived in NW Oklahoma City  I would frequently take evening walks at Stinchcomb Wildlife Refuge. The preserve is roughly 1000-acres located on the suburbs of Oklahoma City and Yukon adjacent to the Wiley Post Airport. Beginning from the parking lot at end of NW 50th street  the maintenance road will take you 2.5 miles upriver to the Kilpatrick bridge  where the N. Canadian river enters the reserve. However  the city only maintains the trail to the remote communication building  from there the trail becomes overgrown in the summers. The park is typically visited by local neighbors  bicyclists  horseback riders  and dog lovers. ,Oklahoma,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40109,yes
3246,On 9/29/15  at 3- 4 am  I and several family members heard a series of  whooping  sounds followed by the sound of a cow in distress.  The sounds were very clear...we had never heard this  whooping  sound before.  My Dad  who is 75 years old grew up in this area and has never heard these sounds.  He has hunted in this area his whole life and is very familiar with the local wildlife. ,East of Ponca City on highway 60.  South of the highway. ,Osage,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40113,no
3247,My family and I arrived home after sundown and I left my car headlights on to open the door to my house.  We could hear my dog barking and coming toward us when he chased what I at first thought was a man.  When it came around the trees we could see it was dark brown  covered with fur  and running towards the car (which we were still in).  It then veered and ran back into the woods  still followed by our dog. It looked to me to be more of a youth than full grown. ,6 miles west on highway 33  1 mile north  northeast corner. ,Payne,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40119,yes
3248,My teenage son is a night owl and was awake in his bedroom late one night/early one morning.  Approximately 2 or 3 am  he heard what he described as a  metal scraping on wood  sound outside his bedroom window.  He then heard several inhalations/exhalations as if something was sniffing at the window followed by a loud grunt.  He described this sound as  buck snort  or someone clearing their throat.  We have 3 little dogs in a pen right by his window and he reported that the dogs were not barking which is odd because they usually bark at everything!!  He immediately got out of bed and spent the rest of the night on the couch.  He wouldn  t sleep for several nights following this incident.  He told me about it the next morning.  When I got home from work that afternoon  I went around to his window to investigate.  The window was open approximately 1-2 inches.  We have casement type windows and he had rolled them in but not latched them so they could have been opened from the outside but it would have taken some effort.  We live near a major highway so I immediately thought that it might be a vagrant trying to break in.  2 days later  I returned home from shopping around dusk and found the door on a camping trailer we had on the property had been opened.  No one was in the trailer and nothing appeared to have been tampered with.  The metal that my husband had wedged in the door to latch it was on the ground right by the steps.  The wind wasn  t blowing that day so we know it didn  t blow open. ,Specific instructions omitted ,Payne,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40119,yes
3249,It was Thursday 11/25/11 at approximatly 8 20 just outside of Albion Oklahoma. I have 50-acres of mountain hunting land on K-trail mountain road. It was lightly raining and around 50 deg. I was by myself setting up a second feeder for the morning hunt. I walked approximatly 30 yards off the road to move some brush and I heard a very strange howl/growl. It was just on the other side of the road by my truck. I started heading back to my truck and it howled again. I had never heard anything like this before. I yelled back at it  and it responded with a more aggressive howl. Shortly after that a large rock came up through the brush and landed in the road. This exchange of howls/growls went on for 20-minutes. I never saw anything but I can tell you it wasn  t a bear or deer. I guess there is something to the sign I saw on Indian highway   Indian HWY Home of Bigfoot . , ,Pushmataha,2,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40127,yes
3250,Driving down the road headed towards Honobia  I topped a hill. I was on a long downhill then a long uphill into a left hand turn. As I came over the hill  in the distance at the top of the next hill  something reddish brown crossed the road. It didnâ€™t appear to go straight across  more at a diagonal from right to left with right being the farthest point left being the closest. When I first picked it up in my sight  because of the coloration  my brain said dog. By the time it was out of sight  I realized it was on two feet. It happened in a few seconds. It went across the highway very fast. I was late to my destination so I just slowed down in the area to look. Once I got to where I was going and unloaded my gear I went back and spent about an hour walking up and down both sides of the highway to see if there were any tracks to indicate what I had seen. While doing this a person stopped to see if I was having trouble and needed assistance. When I told him what I was doing his response was â€œyeah you get a lot of that here.â€ ,[Investigator Notes  3/4 mile east of intersection of Hwy 144 and Nokia Loop Road.

3251,While driving to work some thing large ran behind my mini van as I slowed and made a left hand turn. It looked like a silhouette of a very large man. I was shocked but didn  t stop until I was about 1/2 Mile away. The sun was just about to come up. It was about 6 00 am. Kind of rattled all day thinking back on it frequently because it made no sense. It was cool  drizzling  dark and in a very rural area.

3252,Last night my friend  his girlfriend  and I went kayaking around Keystone Lake  in Oklahoma. The lake levels have been about 15 ft above normal  and we decided to go kayaking and camping. There is a penninsula that is open during the day to people to use four wheelers and dirt bikes on  but since the water has been so high for about a month it has been inaccessable to them due to the path going out there  is under water. We got out there about 8 00 p.m. and kayaked the mile or so to a nice sandy beach  and set up the tent and started a fire. We cooked hot dogs and fished a bit but caught nothing. Midnight rolled around and my friends girlfriend had to be at work early the next morning so he was going to escort her back to her car. Just as they were getting their gear together  we heard some grunting and repeating howling noise with the same tone pattern about five times. I am an Eagle Scout and a seasoned camper in these parts  so hearing this noise frightened me a bit and made me not want to tend the fire alone on the island. I then kayaked with the two of them back to the cars. My friend and I returned to the camp site about 1 30 or so  we got the fire started again and decided to fish a small wooded area that was under water 50 or so feet from our beach. We did that with no success for 30 minutes or so  and headed back to the beach. My friend was about 20 feet the shore and I was about 30 feet and we passed a lower area with willow trees on our way back to our camp and a very large rock  much too large for a human to pick up and throw landed within feet of his kayak. We stopped and shined our flash lights at the shore to see what threw that at us. We could only see just beyond the trees due to the low hanging willow trees. We sat and talked a minute about what just happend and another slightly larger rock landed in the same area making a huge splash. We both got really scared and back paddled a good distance from the shore. I told him what I thought had just happend and watching a show on Bigfoot one time  I remembered that they throw rocks and make similar noises to the ones we had heard earlier. We made the decision to pack up and head out. We heard or saw nothing else while packing up the tent and gear. We took turns shining a light in the forest while the other packed his gear  because we were both pretty scared. I have camped hundreds of nights and have never left in the night  like we did last night. We kayaked around the island before we left to see if any boats were anchored  but we were definitly the only humans on the island. ,It is the  four wheeling  penninsula right next to the Appalacia Bay boat ramp. It is closed right now due to the lake level being up 15+ feet  so it is an island now  so whatever we saw will still be there unless it can swim. ,Tulsa,4,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40143,no
3253,This is the third encounter I believe I have had at this same location. I was out fishing in my kayak and I was about to turn back to go to my truck. I was coasting enjoying the evening then there was a large splash about 15 feet toward the shore beside me. I had one headphone in on the same side so I couldn  t hear well but I did not hear any movement. There is no way this could have been a fish because the pond does not have any fish large enough. I believe it was a rock because it did not float back to the top. It had been raining a lot that week so it would have taken almost a monster truck to get to that side of the pond. I have had a similar incident at the same location hearing what sounds like wood knocks at night and I have had another incident where a rock was thrown into the pond while I was on it as well. It is very tough to get to that area so I firmly believe that it couldn  t have been anything else. I have also had an incident where I was further back in the woods and heard something running at me to which I took off in my truck. I am very confident that this could have been a bigfoot encounter and it may be worth looking into. ,I was fishing in an old strip mining pit. There is a trail that leads back to the area but you must be in a 4x4 vehicle to get all the way back to the pond. ,Tulsa,4,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40143,yes
3254,Date of Experience   10/16/2020 Time of Experience    6 15 am Location of Experience   Collinsville Oklahoma Personal Property. I went archery hunting on my 11 acres on 10/16/2020 and as I approached my tree stand around 6 00am I noticed a tree that was by my shooting lane had been pushed over.  The tree was approximately  2 or 3 inches in diameter and absolutely no strong winds to push it over the whole week while I was hunting.  I do know that it was standing and not pushed over the day before. Seemed strange but continued to harness up and climb into my deer stand.  Still being very dark that morning I nocked an arrow and settled in to my stand.  Approximately 15 minutes after I shut my headlamp off   I heard a distinct knock on a tree about 100 yards or so from my tree stand deep in the woods.  It sounded like someone hitting a large stick or baseball bat against a tree.   It knocked about 4 times then stopped and a few minutes later it knocked two times.  It was the strangest thing I have ever heard and the first time I have ever experienced it.  I know that nothing could have made that sound other than a person.  Iâ€™ve been an avid hunter all my life and have been in the woods many times  but never before have I heard anything like it  and hope I never do again. ,I wish to not share my exact location.  However  it was around hi-way 169 and 156th St North. ,Tulsa,4,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40143,no
3255,Hello I drive a delivery truck to Kansas 3 times a week.On the day of this sighting I had taken my 12 year old son with me on my route.As we turned onto Highway 10 from Highway 75 I told him to watch for deer on his side of the truck and I  d watch on mine. This road has had several deer killed from vehicles and I didn  t want to hit one.As I drove we watched and seen no deer along the 6 miles stretch to Wann.As we rounded the curve on the east side of Wann it turns back into wheat fields  so we resumed watching for deer.As I started to watch on my side of the road I looked out across a winter wheat field (which is green this time of year)and noticed about 200-300 yards away a HUGE black figure bent over. I slowed the truck down to get a better look when my son turned to look at what I was looking at and he said  Dad is that a Bigfoot? and about that time it stood upright and looked at the truck.I replied  I think so. I would have to say it was about 7-8 feet tall and about 300-500 pounds with jet black hair and a cone shaped head and very well proportioned. As we watched it for about 2 minutes it just stood there and watched us while it ate something it was picking off of a small branch it held in its right hand. (berries perhaps)The wierd thing about it it never ran or walked away.As we drove on it turned its whole body to watch us drive off not just its head. Now when I drive that road I carry a digital camera with me to get a picture if I happen to see it again. ,Directions are From Highway 75 North of Bartlesville  Oklahoma take Highway 10 East about 6 miles to Wann Oklahoma.Once you pass the convenience store in Wann the field is just outside of the city limits on the North side of the road. ,Nowata,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40105,yes
3256,I and one other person were in the area measuring and sampling rocks exposed near Cane Creek (we are geologists); throughout that morning  farmers had been hunting on their lands. As a result we could hear sporadic gunfire all around us; after about thirty minutes to an hour  most of the gunfire had ceased. Some time later as I worked  I heard a rustling sound   behind me. Believing it to be some kind of animal coming towards us  I turned my head to see behind me. Immediately  I observed something  hanging from a low branch over the bridge on the opposite bank of the creek from me. The first feature I noticed was the unusually long arms of the thing.  Secondly  I noticed that it was covered by reddish-brown long hair. The creature has hanging from the lower branch with its arms much like an orangutan does; in fact  the hair and the way it hanging from the tree made me think of it as an orangutan. Also  for some reason  I seem to remember that the arms had less hair than the rest of the body. The entity that I saw was about four to five feet long with about half of that being arm. The body was round and squat. I did not notice the legs or head of the thing. The window of observation was about ten to fifteen seconds although I cannot be positive.  Anyway  as soon as I noticed the thing  it dropped from the tree onto the ground.  However  the presence of the bridge prevented me from seeing it hit the ground  but I do believe I heard further rustling sounds although that was probably just imagination. Afterwards  I asked my companion if he saw or heard anything; although he indicated that he may have heard something  he said he did not see anything extraordinary.  That meant I was the only witness. We did not really search the area afterwards for traces or the creature itself. Since no other unusual sounds or sights occurred after this  we felt that nothing would probably be revealed. However  I did have a vague temporary feeling that this thing was advancing towards us.  Of course  considering the brief span of observation time  the distance (about 200 to 300 feet from me)  and the lack of additional evidence  I still cannot be positive that what I saw was genuine. ,Incident occurred in the Northeast corner of NE 1/4 SE 1/4 Sec. 14 T14N R15E in western Muskogee County  Oklahoma. The area was about 4.5 miles south of the junction of Highways 16 and 72 west of Muskogee and 2 miles west of Highway 72. The creature  or whatever it was  was observed near a bridge above Cane Creek. ,Muskogee,2,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40101,yes
3257,It was on Halloween night in 1996.  I had taken my younger brother  a high school senior at the time  to Veteran  s Lake inside the Chickisaw National Recreation Area in Sulphur  Oklahoma because some of his friends from the high school band were going to meet that night to try and see the  Lady of the Lake  (a local myth).  As we went to the lake I was rather preoccupied with the conversation I was having with my brother so I did not pay close attention to the events going on around us  if any. After dropping him off to hang out with his friends I left to return home. As I drove back down toward the 12th street entrance to the park I drove over the Rock Creek Bridge which crosses Rock Creek just a few yards south of the Rock Creek camp grounds.  As I drove over the low water bridge I saw a figure squatted at the edge of the creek about 20 yards east  down river from the bridge.  It was quite large  at least 4.5 to 5 feet tall in the squatted position.  I drove on down a little ways and turned the car around.  I went back to the bridge and pulled to where my head lights would shine down creek as well as possible.  It was still there.  It was on the balls of its feet with its hands in the water.  The creature was huge and hairy.  The dark hair was shiny in the car light but it was hard to make out the exact color.  For what was only a few seconds I am sure ( but seemed like at least 15 minutes) I watched the creature.  It did not even glorify my presence with a glance.  It merely rose up  walked accross the creek  up the bank and off into the trees.  What amazed me the most was that there are street lights along that park road and the city of Sulphur is only about a half a mile away. ,The Chickasaw National Recreation Area is quite easy to find as it is the only National Park in Oklahoma.  It is located in the city of Sulphur off of Highway 7. ,Murray,4,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40099,yes
3258,It was a summer  moonlit night  my then boyfriend and myself were standing outside after a date saying our goodbye  s and both leaning with our back towards his pickup truck. We were facing our pasture behind the house that I grew up in. We were talking quietly and not moving much. My parents have a propane tank which is silver in color and approx. 20 to 25 feet long that sits approx 50 yards behind their house.  As we were both looking towards the pasture we noticed something approximately 7 to 8 ft tall running across the pasture. It became more visible as it ran in front of the propane tank and was running in an upright position. It was dark in color. It ran southwestward towards the tree line of the pasture  but distinctly we could see it turn and look at us as it ran. Simultaneously my boyfriend and myself asked each other if we saw that  and ran into the house telling my mother.  She grabbed a flashlight and shown it towards the pasture and saw nothing. ,Located below a hill or ridgeline  approx. 2 or so miles from a lake.

3259,Date   Mid October  1987 Weather   No wind  very still  partly cloudy Time   About (15) minutes after sunrise  around 0645 hours. Temperature   40  s farenheit Nearest town   Murphy  Oklahoma.  Murphy has about (100) residents and is a very small town.  The town is in a remote location and has very little vehicle or pedestrian traffic.  Murphy is about (3) miles East of the incident location. Incident location description   The area contains large sporadic open hay meadows.  The meadows are surrounded by densly forested small rolling hills. Numerous size creeks run through the location.  The Grand River is also located in the area. All types of wild game are in abundance. Tree stand description  I was bowhunting for deer.  The stand was on one of the above forested rolling hills.  I had located my stand in a tree that overlooked a very small creek.   A hilltop was directly behind me. The tree was abnormal in its shape because it grew almost sideways from the stump.  I was able to literally walk forward on the tree and get on my stand.  Very little climbing was involved.  The stand was about (8) feet off the ground and about half way down from the top of the hill.  The hill was about (5) stories high. Person reporting description   I was (18) years old at the time of the incident.  I was wearing full fall camo clothing and had my face painted with camo paint.  I was wearing pure skunk scent to mask my scent. Person reporting summary    I drove to the above location about (1) hour before daybreak.  I parked in a hay meadow and walked about a 1/2 mile towards my tree stand.   I walked quietly but I used a flashlight to navigate through the dense forest.  I climbed into my tree stand before sunrise.  I remained very still and waited silently.  As the sun rose  the woods soon became very active with squirrels running around my stand and birds singing in the trees.  I had been in my stand for about (20) minutes when the woods suddenly became still.  The birds stopped singing and the above squirrels had disappeared.  I found this very odd but I remained perfectly still in my stand.  About (5) minutes later  (3-4) small rocks were thrown in my direction.   The rocks were thrown from behind me. One struck the branches over my head and the other rocks landed on the ground within (10) yards in front of me.  I continued to remain perfectly still.  I then heard the sound of breaking branches behind me.  The sound came from the top of the hill and continued down towards my direction.  Something heavy footed was walking towards me from behind.  I continued to hear breaking branches but the sound now sounded like branches were being stepped on as well.  I also clearly heard the sound of footsteps in the leaves as the branches were being broken.  The creature definitely was not afraid of being heard and was approaching me in a bold manner. I continued to remain perfectly still.  The creature was breathing very heavy.  The creature  s breathing was unique in that I did not hear him inhale.  The creature distinctly made his exhale breaths louder that his inhale breaths. The creature sounded like he was within (5) yards directly behind me.   I also smelled a  musky  odor when the creature approached me.  I continued to remain perfectly still.   The creature stood behind me for about (2-3) minutes and did not move.   The creature continued his distinct breathing.  The creature then gave a short snarling growl sound.  The creature then walked away stepping on branches as he left the area.  The creature sounded like he walked back towards the top of the hill directly behind me.  I no longer heard him after a few minutes.  About (5) minutes later  the woods became active again with the sound of birds singing and squirrels playing.  I remained still for about another (5) minutes.  I then quickly got down from my stand and ran towards the above open meadow.  I then got in my vehicle and left the area. Witnesses   None.  I was alone. Physical evidence   None.  I did not check due to fear. Damage/injuries   None. Person reporting hypothesis of the incident   I believe the creature was on the above hilltop and saw me arrive.  I believe he saw me walk to my stand and tried to make me leave by throwing rocks at me.  I believe the creature approached when I did not leave and tried to intimidate me with his branch breaking  deep breathing and growl. Credentials   I retired in 2015 as a detective from the Tulsa Police Department after (18) years of service. Note   I have experienced a lot of fearful moments in my life but this incident was definitely one of my worst encounters and will not be forgotten. ,See report. ,Mayes,2,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40097,yes
3260,I was down on the lake target practicing with my rifle. My mother had come along to get out of the house. I was shooting into a mud bank at the edge of a small clearing that has a deep gully running down beside it. I had been there about a week before and had left early because I had been overcome with a sudden dread bordering on terror. I had been unable to explain this at the time  but the events that transpired next seemed to have justified my fear. I had fired several shots to set in my scope while my mother walked down to the lake. I soon had my scope set and followed my mother down to the lake taking my rifle with me. We then decided to walk up to an area  were I wanted to check for deer sign  which is directly across the gully from the car. At this time the sun was just going down on the horizon. We had just reached the area and I was busy looking at the ground for sign when I heard a series of peculiar whistles  at first I thought it might have been a cow but they were to high pitched and had an strange quality to them. As I was listening to this my mother walked over and told me that someone was standing by the car I couldn  t see the car for trees from where I was at so I walked over to where she had been standing. I could see the car but couldn  t see anyone . I then asked her if she could still see them  thinking she might have mistaken a tree for something else. she told me it was gone. As I said earlier the sun was going down and it was getting dark so we started back down the hill around where the gully terminated and up the dirt road that ran past the clearing where the car was parked. By the time we reached the road it was getting dark enough to be hard to see. There is a lot of brush on the side of the road and we couldn  t see very far. As we were going up the hill about 20 yards from the car  the only way I can think of to describe what happened next is to say we hit a wall of smell. It smelled just like an outhouse and was very powerful. About that point I took what my mother had described to me to heart and decided that there was something in the brush in front of us and at the same time began to get extremely scared. I still had my rifle so I fired a couple of shots in the air. No sooner than the echo died away I heard heavy footsteps like the sound of a man running  going away from us towards the car and the gully   these sounds ended with a heavy thud like something jumped off the edge of the gully and landed on the steep bank. We then cautiously made our way to the car. I held my rifle at the ready while my mom got in the car. While this was happening I heard a sound coming from the edge of gully about 15 yards in front of me  it sounded like a cross between a rhythmic grating sound and a human voice. I then got in the car and we drove away. After we drove home my mother described to what she saw in more detail  what she saw is as follows  a tall manlike shape with light from the setting sun ! behind it  she was unable to make out a face because of the light behind it  but she could tell that it was very broad shouldered and from the light surrounding it that it was covered in hair about 6 inches long and reddish brown in color. Also by using my own height as a scale which is 5  11  and the car as a reference we were able to determined that it was approximately 7 feet tall. After considering all these things we decided that we had encountered at least one sasquatch. , ,Marshall,8,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40095,yes
3261,Something very unusual  just happened to me this Thanksgiving. I went with my wife to see her father.  The area is western  Oklahoma. It is wheat country.  The land is flat and laid off into square sections of land. Occasionally a stream interrupting the square sections of land. The streams are the only place you will find trees with the exception around the houses and machine sheds. There are wheat fields after wheat fields.  Other crops grown there such as sunflowers. I have tried counting wild turkeys. There would be as many as 200 in a flock feeding in the stubbed fields.  There are plenty of deer  some pheasant  rabbits  coon  lots of small rodents. I donâ€™t believe there are caves there. It was getting about 9 30pm Thursday evening the 26th of November 2009.   I was bored so I went out of the house away from the rest of the family  found a solid piece of wood out of my father-in-lawâ€™s shop and gave a couple of wood knocks then walked over to the corral fence and gave a holler.  I didnâ€™t expect anything at all. Then to my surprise I got a wood knock back.   The knock came from the creek where all the trees grow.   At this point I went to the house and had my wife come out and listen with me.   I gave a couple of hollers right away a coyote howled back and started coming our way. Wasnâ€™t long before he was about 100â€™ to 120â€™ away in the shadows and started yipping and howling at us  which was very strange. I also smelled a terrible odor and I have a very keen sense of smell. It smelled like human sewage mixed with rotten meat. It was really bad. Also my wife heard a low moan or growl. She said it lasted a long time and it was a ways off. She does not know what to think about the sounds she heard. So the next night I had my son-in- law come out of the house with me. I gave the same wood knocks then went over to the corral gave a holler.   And again a little to my surprise I got an answer. This time my son-in-law was there to hear and witness.    The knock came from spot as same as the night before.  , ,Major,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40093,no
3262,I was in the Love Valley Wildlife Management Area hunting feral hogs. I had been sitting on my stand for about two hours when I began to smell something akin to cat urine or skunk musk  and I thought that with the prevailing winds a large boar must have just crossed the ridge above me. So after a little while when the odor did not decrease I decided to see if I could circle around the top of the ridge and get a shot at the boar. I left my stand and moved about 60 yards down the base of the ridge (away from my hunting buddies who were in two different stands further down the base of the ridge) to a well used game trail and began my ascent. I got about halfway up the slope and something came flying through the air to my right and then after another step or two something came thought the air to my left this time by the sound of its landing and crashing through the brush  something much heavier than the first object. At this time I froze and began to scan the ridge line first with my eyes and then with my rifle scope  and I began to think that one of the guys I was hunting with was playing a prank on me. So I continued to climb the hill until a large piece of rock (it looked like a piece of ruined tombstone from the abandoned cemetery on the hill top but I am not sure) landed just at my feet and rolled down the hill with some force and momentum behind it. At almost that same moment I caught just the faintest glimmer of movement and from that was able to make out the shape of what looked like a huge man. I am 6   2  and 260 lbs but this thing was at least 9-10   tall and three or four times as broad as I am. I slowly brought my rifle and scope up to get a better look at it. Most of it was covered by brush and under growth but its head down to its upper chest were clearly visible. It had a shaggy coat (the breeze did a fair job of breaking up its silhouette) that was dark colored even with the aid of my scope all I could tell was that the beast was covered in fur and that it was of dark coloration. Its eyes seemed impossibly small for the size of its oblong head. I watched it with my scope for perhaps a minute or it could have been ten  I honestly could not tell you as I was not sure whether to be fascinated or terrified (from its size and mass I was not sure the 30-06 I had in my hands would be sufficient if I needed to be terrified). After a period of time I took one slow step back and then another after about my third slow step back down the hill the beast slowly turned as if to disregard me and my rifle and walked away in the other direction. After it was gone I found the piece of stone that had landed on the path in front of me and tumbled past and as I said before it could have been a piece of one of the crumbling tombstones from on top of the ridge or it could have been rock from some other source but I can tell you that I could not have thrown it at least not as far or with the same force as this rock had been thrown. I would estimate it to have weighed around 45-55 lbs.  After that I proceeded to go back down the base of the ridge to where both of my friends were still sitting in their stands one about 80 yards down from where I was set up and the other about 90 yards from the first. I have not shared this with them or anyone but my wife for fear of ridicule  but that is my story and it is what happened to me. ,We were hunting in the Hog pen area of the WMA. ,Love,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40085,yes
3263,I saw a hairy medium build creature about six foot tall with long arms crossing a dirt road. At first it was walking then began a fast gate after seeing me coming in my truck.

3264,In 2002  in early fall (it was still nice outside) I was driving to work.  Ahead of me  on the crest of a hill  I saw a creature crossing the road.  It did not remind me of a monkey.  The legs and torso were too long.  It was on all fours at first; the limbs were substantial.  It was covered with dark brown longish hair.  It started across the road on all fours; the back limbs looked about the same length as the front limbs.  It was not great big and bulky; however it was of considerable size.  There was quite a bit of room between the stomach area and the ground.  Very tall in that way.  After a few steps  it stood up and took a couple of huge running steps  as if trying to hurry up.  Then it leaped up over about a 6    embankment and a fence.  I went back later on after work to the site  and there were numerous footprints of all kinds of game; obviously it was a frequently used crossing for all sorts of animals. ,From the city of Tryon; approx. 1 to 2 miles west on Highway 105 at the peak of a hill. ,Lincoln,16,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40081,yes
3265,In 1977 I went with my church Bethel Baptist on a retreat to Robbers Cave State Park. We had arrived on Friday evening and would be leaving on Sunday afternoon. Well  on Saturday I couldn  t shake the feeling that we  the campers  were being watched. Later that afternoon a storm rolled in and it was going pretty strong by the time lights out came. The girls cabin was located at the far end of the camp ground and was in the shape of a horseshoe. I was sleeping on the top bunk bed on the right arm  if you were standing at the door  in the middle of the three bunk beds for that side. Everyone was really nervous because of the storm so it took a while for us girls to go to sleep. Well  I couldn  t go to sleep because I  m really sacred of storms so I was just laying in my sleeping bag when I heard the sound of the screen door to the cabin open. I thought I was hearing things until I heard it bang shut. I told myself it was one of the girls or maybe a counselor going to the bathroom  but then I smelled something foul. At that point I became very still  hardly breathing  and I could hear heavy shuffling foot steps walking around the cabin on the others side. Then the shuffling started coming my way and the smell increased. I became like a board. Then next thing I know I can feel something standing above and behind me and I hear this deep breathing and sort of a soft growl coming from above my head  which I couldn  t understand because I was on the top bunk bed. I wanted to scream but I was too scared. I continued to listen and what ever it was walked to the window at the foot of the bunk bed and then returned to the head of the bed  standing behind me. What happened next froze the blood in my veins. Something large  and furry  touched my face. It traced my face  and along the headgear I was wearing for my braces. The next thing I remember was waking up in the morning  on the floor beside the bunk bed  in my sleeping bag  with my pillow under my head. ! I have no idea how I got there and it really freaked me out. I thought I had had a really bad dream until the girl who had been sleeping in the bunk bed beside me  on the bottom  grabbed me the next morning and told me she had seen it. I asked her what she had seen and she said that it was a big black hairy creature standing behind me and she couldn  t scream because she thought that if she did  it would kill me. She and I made a promise never to tell anyone about what happened  and I haven  t until this day. , ,Latimer,2,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40077,yes
3266,In January of 2003 two friends and I were bobcat hunting in western Johnston County.  It was a cloudy day  which increased our chances of seeing some cats.  I enjoy hunting but was a little green behind the ears as far as hunting bobcats.  However  two of us were able to harvest our 1st cats at two different stands.  The other guy was not an experienced hunter and just enjoyed being out seeing some country he had never seen.  He and I were driving together with the other friend following us.  We crossed a cattle guard going into a heavily wooded pasture and we  re driving somewhat slowly.  Then out of the woods came something.  It was about 30 ft in front of us  and walking on all fours.  It was very muscular with a heavy coat of grey fur.  I was amazed and the definition of the back muscles.  After about three seconds I asked   What is that?   In a long drawn out reply he says  I...don  t.... know?   I then said   Why won  t it look at us?   I never accelerated and just continued to creep down the road.  It was odd how the front appendages really didn  t support this creature.  It  s back legs kind of kicked out as it scurried across the road.  We were able to view him for probably 6-7 full seconds.  It  s hard to tell how tall this thing was because it stayed bent over as it walked (like a monkey).  From what I saw  it stayed at around 3 and half ft above the ground.  But its butt was never more than 6 inches off the ground as it walked.  Within seconds it vanished.  We both thought it looked and walked like a gorilla.  I said it has to be a large bobcat if anything.  And that  s what we kind of agreed upon for years.  Until recently I saw a close-up photo on Monster Quest of a creature in Florida that appeared like a gorilla.  Last month I called the friend and asked him what it was he thought we saw five years ago.  We agreed this thing looked to be about 150 to 175 lbs in weight and could no way be a bobcat.   I told him that in 1999 in that same area I did hear a scream one night about a half mile south of the sighting.  He asked why I never told him that story.  I guess I never linked the two occurrences till recently. ,The sighting was north of Mannsville OK. ,Johnston,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40069,yes
3267,We were walking down the road enjoying our summer vacation.  When one of us noticed that there was something walking in the pasture North of where we were standing.  It was close to 7 feet tall  had long white hair (at least a foot)  was walking on two legs.  It stopped when it noticed us standing there watching it.  Actually we were almost too scared to run.  Anyway it acted like it was going to come our way so we took off for a little ways then stopped to look again.  Everyone knows that a fence with 6 strands of barbed wire is at least 5 feet tall right.  Well  it stepped over that like it wasn  t there and kept on going to the East taking long strides and swinging its arms back and forth while it walked.  A few days later we were in the same general area and noticed some long white hair hooked on the top wire of the fence.  We took it home to prove our story we told the day before.  We called it a Honka.  Have to say that we were more careful about how late we stayed out from that day on.  Always made sure we were home before dark.  Until the moment we saw it we had heard lots of stories but never believed them.  Seeing is believing.  If you can talk to anyone in the Dustin area you will be told of several sightings of this nature and also will be told about what everyone called  The Light  ,it was about 3 miles east of hwy 84.  not too far from the mountain.  There was creek that ran through the pasture. ,Hughes,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40063,yes
3268,My mother and her sister were going to get the cows from the pasture to bring them to the barn. They had just gone through a shelter belt of trees into a clearing when they heard rustling like something moving in the trees. Thinking it was one of the cows they turned around and saw a very tall  hairy creature running away from them. It was standing completely upright running on two legs. Needless to say they ran the other direction. ,The sighting occurred 5 miles north and 2 miles west of Gould  Harmon County  Oklahoma. ,Harmon,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40057,yes
3269,Several of us old hippies meet once a year in October at Tishomingo  Ok to camp and enjoy each other.  This October (the first week-end) we met as usual at the Tishomingo state park.  There were 15 of us at the campsite on Saturday night.  It was around 9 30 pm when I was leaving the burning embers and people behind me to walk to my tent alone.  When I got about halfway to the tent  someone ran across in front of me in front (close to) the tent.  I knew all of the campers were at the site and most of them cannot run.  I don  t drink or do drugs and so I stopped for a moment and thought about who it could have been.  My tent was facing the Blue River.  I stopped  turned around and decided to try to get back to all of the people.  When I reached them  I asked for someone to walk me back to the tent with a flashlight.  Two of my friends  males  made fun of the sighting I informed them about and told me it was probably a deer.  Deer run on four legs!  Then they told me it was probably one of the brown bears.  Brown bears can  t run with the stride of a man and they aren  t that tall (around 6   or more).  I got in my tent and loaded my gun and slept with it under my pillow (my hands making sure the steel was touching the gun all night long).  I had two small dogs with me that I felt would alert me to any other encounters with something outside of the tent.  I know I saw  the stride of a man as he ran from West to East.  There is a large light towards the South end of the camping area that allowed me to see the creature.  I am positive everyone was at the campsite when the  Thing  was seen running.  When I told my girlfriend in Florida about the sighting she said I ought to tell someone and therefore I am telling you (whoever you are. ,Camping area 2 in Tishomingo State Park.

3270,It was dark  about 8pm. My two sons and I were watching television while eating popcorn. The eldest  age 16 was sitting accross the room  on the loveseat. The youngest  age 8 was sitting next to me on the sofa  we were sharing a bowl of popcorn placed between us. I smelled this horrific stench coming from the window directly behind us.(My family has teased me about having the nose of a hound)so the my 16 yr.old says  Oh Mom your always smelling something.  Well  I look around and the smell dissipates we continue watching television; a few minutes pass  and the stench blows in again. I got up while telling my oldest son to help me pull out the sofa that there is something horrible under it.As he appooached he smells the stench and says It  ts a snake   the youngest moved back  we pulled the couch out and looked all over the entire room and came up with nothing.We notice the breeze blowing the curtain and deside that whatever the source it  s outside  and we  ll check it out in daylight. The 16 yr old went outside about an hour later. He came back inside for the shotgun.(His Dad has taken him hunting since he was 6 years old  he knows guns and the woods.)He said someone was standing in back  about 6 yards (north )of the house by a railroad tie post  watching the house  and it was one darn big guy. He took the gun and went toward our chicken pen. I heard him yell from about 50 yards or so from our chicken pen to  call the law.  I was scared beyond measure for my son not knowing what was happening. I called the sheriff  after about 10 min. my son came back to the house he said the guy stepped over a bobbed wire fence  and jumped over a brush pile while leaving. He  d not had to use the gun. Two sheriff deputies arrived.They shined lights up and down the yard and property and found nothing. My son went to his Grandmothers house to inform her that we had a prowler. She lived about 40 yards northeast of us.He  d been gone about 20 min.when I heard the metal latch of an outside storage building.Someone had gone into the building.Now my youngest son and I were in the house  the eldest knowing I was already spooked would not be lurking about. His Dad was out of town working putting up a gas rig. The question being who had opened the latch?The building is my laundry room and contained my washer  dryer  and deepfreeze. I phoned my mother-in-law  and asked to speak to my son. When he answered the phone I asked if he  d been there the whole time. The answer being yes  I told him someone had entered the laundry building  and to my knowledge hadn  t left.He said he would be home after telling him to be careful  I waiting and watched. He was home in two minutes. While we were discussing what to do he yelled what in the **** is that? My 8 yr.old ran into the kitchen  they both had seen a face in the picture window behind the sofa.The eldest said it was hairy and dirty. I called the sheriff again  my son got the shotgun  my youngest son and myself waited behind him sitting on the floor with the lights out. I fully expected some deranged vagabond to jump through the window.While waiting we smelled the stench again as we were only 3 or 4 ft. from the window.Then I knew the scent was coming from this person.Knowing this sent chills up my spine. The deputies arrived and again found nothing  and left.I never associated this event with the bigfoot until reading about other icidents.The stench is what ties it in for me  and the discription my son gave of the face in the window  the way this character acted just wasn  t in keeping with anything I  ve ever known. But the deciding factor for me was about 8 months ago I repeated this story to a friend of ours  retired Oklahoma Highway Patrolman  who hunts with my husband.He said this was out of character for any perp he  d ever seen.As close as I can describe it the scent was a mix between dirty wet steamy blue jeans soiled diapers and wet  filthy dog. Thats why for years I thought we  d had a deranged  or drugged tramp lurking about  as my husband had found the signs of someone being in the woods round about. , ,Latimer,2,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40077,yes
3271,This story is as best as I can remember it  I will only use initials of persons involved  but there were several person involved at the time. You can take this story/report however you feel. In the fall of 1971 while i was in High School  it was close to the High School football Homecoming  because several of the students were at Dressers Ranch Barn preparing a Homecoming float  when several menbers of the Talihina  Oklahoma High School football team  drove up to the Barn yelling and Screaming that they had seen something in the woods on Green Hill Road. They even said that what ever it was was bigger than E.S. and had grabbed him while he was in the woods useing the Bathroom. E.S. was a Football player and was well over 6 foot 3 inches tall and weighted approx. 245 lbs. E.S. would not get out of the truck  when they got to Dressers Barn. He was white as a sheet and seem to be in some sore of shock. Another football player E.N. was shacking so bad he couldn  t even zip his own pants. Several of the other football players said they were there when it happened  but didn  t see anything  except E.S. running back to where the fire was  passing them and locking himself in his truck. E.N. jokeingly got his spot light out of his truck to shine it where E.S. had Come from  E.N. was holding the spot light in one hand and trying to take a wiz (leak) at the same time. E.N. said he seen it ( a large Hairy animal) standing about 20 feet from him. E.S. and E.N. were the only ones to actually see whatever it was. But they were convencing enough that the others that were there  jumped in their vehicles and drove to town which was about five miles away. Since we had One of our teachers at dressers barn with us  they came there first. After they told us what had happened  we thought they were pulling our leg (joking). But once we seen the faces of E.S. and E.N.  we thought there had to be something to it. So all of us jumped into our car/trucks and headed out to Green Hill Road to see if we could See anything. Since there was a whole line of cars and trucks going out of town at the same time  the local Police seen us  and Called the highway Patrol and County deputy. they thought we were up to no good. Once we got to Green Hill Road  several of us had spot lights and were shinning out into the woods  where E.S. had been grabbed. We didn  t see anything out of place. Then the Highway Patrol trooper A.T. and the County Deputy H.B. arrived to try to run us off. They did ask  what was going on  so E.S. and E.N. told them what they had seen. After that the Highway patrol trooper A.T. and The Deputy Sheriff H.B. went out into the woods to look around. Just a few minutes later Both came back to the waiting group of High School Students   and told us  If we knew what was good for us We would get out of there. They neither confirmed or denied seeing anything. We all left to go back to town. At School the next day the topic of most conversations was the Green Hill Monster. After School C.B  B.T.  F.M.  J.N.  J.C  F.W.  A.W.  O.C.  R.T.  M.T.  E.N.  B.L.  all returned to Green Hill Road to have a look in the Day light. Found was Three Deer  necks broken  and guts ripped out. None of the Deer had any bullet holes and were intact except for the guts being ripped out. ,300 yard from the east end of Green Hill Road  Southeast of Talihaina  Oklahoma in Leflore County ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40079,yes
3272,I was deer hunting with a friend for whom I have known and hunted with for years. I was in my tree stand at about 9 15 am when I noticed a shape emerming from the tree  s to my left  I then realized it was Scott. I notticed that there was something wrong with him because he was pale white  he was comming up the ridge extremly quick and was looking behind him at all time  s. I motioned to him thinking that he might have been starteled by a big buck  but he let me know real quick that it was not so. Scott stoped at a stump to catch his breath and turned to look behind him once again at this time I became concerrd  for I have never seen him this scared. He finlly arived at my stand obviously extreamly distrubed  I climbed down from my stand and aked what was wrong. He explained to me that something which I chuckled at. He told me that something was behind him and got very disturbed with his presence  and started to stalk him in a very aggresive mannor. He then stood up to see what was walking around him  when all of the sudden a horrible and terrifing yell shot through his body that shook him. He gathered his pack and proceeded to my stand. We talked and decided to investagate the situation due to the fact that we were camped 12 of a mile away. What we found was very disturbing trees snaped in half at 9 to 10 feet high  some very deep indindtions that were 12 to 14  long. Normally that would be no big deal except it had not rained for some time. We followed the tracks for two miles until they went into extremly dence follage. I passed this of as the jitters but the next day I was stalked myself. , ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40079,yes
3273,In July of 1983 I worked for the timber company driving a one ton truck pulling a 12 hundred gallon tanker in the Honobia-Pickens area. On a trip back to our facility a very large hairy creature ran across the road in front of me. I came within a few feet of running over it. It did not stop it just kept on running. It was approximately seven feet tall. The upper torso of its body was a brownish color and the lower was a lighter color. One of the things I particulaily noticed was no SHOES. My first thought was someone  s pulling a prank. I soon realized that couldn  t be  not up here in these mountainous forest. No houses for miles. I was told by phone by a relative that three large manlike  hairy creatures were observed on a persons porch and yard. The man got his SKS and has allegedly shot at one. My relative also told me that contractors who plant young pine seedlings are refuseing to go in near Honobia and plant trees. Today Jan 28  2000 we have had a very heavy snow and while I was home listening to the scanner I overheard a conservation between two Oklahoma game wardens talking about the incident. One told the other to be on the lookout for large manlike hairy creatures. They seemed very serious. T They were talking about the same incident that I have mentioned above. This area is called the Honobia Wildlife area and is very very sparsly inhabited. The area of 875.000 acres is owned by a large timber company and as the loggers move in to cut there are sightings. , ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40079,yes
3274,I was fishing the creek that runs through my mother  s property with a lure. I was just downstream of the fork in the creek that goes to your left as you  re going downstream. My wife  children  mother  sister and brother-in-law were swimming and fishing about 500 feet upstream at our swimming hole. I had been noticing that my lure was running funny and was looking at it trying to fix it before making another cast. Downstream from my position  the creek makes a slight curve to the right. I was standing on rocks  as close to the waters edge as I could  fishing in the fast water just below the rapids. After messing with my lure  I looked up  toward downstream  to make another cast. When I did  I distincly saw the legs  from the mid thigh area down  (my vision was impeded of seeing anything higher than that because of tree limbs) of what I thought at the time was a man  another fisherman  about 50 feet away. It was in full stride  in the edge of the water  walking out of the water onto the bank at the right. I saw it take two steps  one from my left to my right  and another diagonally away from me  disappearing into the thicket. I remember thinking   there  s another fisherman down there   and continued to fish while looking to see where they went. The foliage on both sides of the creek is extremely dense in that area. Having grown up visiting my grandparents and later my parents in that area  and being very familiar with the terrain and forestation from hunting it and fishing it my whole life  I was suprised to see anyone there  that far from the bridge for several reasons. One  it was over 1000 feet downstream from the bridge and there was no car parked anywhere near the bridge  two  we had been swimming and fishing for over an hour before I had the encounter and there was noone fishing by while we were there  three  there is no residence or access by road anywhere nearer than the upstream bridge  four  the terrain is extremely rugged  full of underbrush including a thick maze of briars and poison ivy  and from experience  anyone who is there is either fishing up or downstream  five  the treck up or downstream is rugged and time consuming to trevail causing one to wade  cross at fast water areas and walk in the water on slick mossy rocks  there is nothing that would bring one to that remote area unless they were fishing. As a result  I made about three more casts while intently watching to see this  other fisherman  to reappear. He never did. I began to get a little spooked while thinking   What did I just see ? I walked on downstream looking intently for what I saw to reappear either downstream or on the bank area where I saw it disappear. Nothing. I couldn  t hear any sound other than the rapids rushing behind me. It would have been hard to carry on a conversation where I was standing when I saw it. I began to second guess myself when I couldn  t see anybody or anything. Then I realized  if I saw what I that I saw  there will be water on the rocks and bank at the edge. Even though I was spooked  I decided I has to investigate any traces of something leaving the water. I waded down to where I saw it leave the water  and sure enough  there was a wet footprint on a big rock and several sprinkles on others rocks and dirt on the bank. I peered into the thicket and saw nothing but a faint trail to the other fork of the creek  probably only about 30 feet away. I decided I had seen enough  and was sure that whatever it was was there close watching me. I hightailed it back upstream to where my family was still swimming and told them the story. It wasn  t until then that my mother told me about the recent sighting at Honobia  which is only about 9 miles west. I  d like to mention here that I never really believed there was any credibility in the big foot sighting stories  but I was quickly convincing myself that what I saw wasn  t human. When I saw it  and I only saw it for a second  I that it was someone who was wearing dark navy blue overalls. The legs were a consistent diameter from top to bottom and I saw no indication of a human-like foot  like the pants legs extended over a persons shoe. I saw no distinction in color  it looked like a solid dark blue or black. My sister and brother-in-law had a video camera on the bank and the three of us decided to go back to the spot to see if we could get something on tape. All we got was video of the still wet rocks  and some disturbed soil where some rocks had been embedded in the dirt. It appeared that something had been sitting there. You could see indentions of where rock had been in the dirt and in the bottom of the indentions  the dirt was still damp looking  proving it hadn  t been that way long. I also found a length of dung which we videoed that looked something like coyote only bigger in diameter than I had seen before from a coyote. My sister and her husband agreed with me that no human would bust through that thicket just to visit the creek. ,Highway 144 east of Octavia at new Big Eagle Fork bridge; south on Big Eagle Fork 300 meters approximately  but north of bluff. ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40079,yes

3276,I found what was left of a black and tan coonhound after it had been shot in the head and dumped at the Honobia  OK town dump. All the soft tissue (organs/muscles/connective tissue etc.)was gone (with the exception of the entire head  the four paws and the skin and hair). It was apparently eaten by the same animal that had pulled upwards on the hound  s chest wall and stretched out ligaments in an upward motion. The ligaments did not break but were stretched enough to easily remove the contents of the chest cavity. The ribs and the sternum  as I recall  were still held together by this stretched out ligament.The head was totally untouched except for the .22 cal. bullet hole in it  s temple.  The hound  s skin had been pulled apart over the abdomen and chest and peeled back and was laying in the same spot where it fell after being separated (on each side of the body  but still attached to the back of the dog. There were no teeth marks on the bones. The hound  s eyes were still present and untouched.  Only inches away there was a dark and greasy spot that smelled  not surprisingly  like a dead dog...horrible. The dark greasy spot was about three feet in circumference and was on very hard flat ground. There was nothing noticible on the dark spot  just a dark tint to the ground. I believe that it took the use of human-like hands to pull the chest upwards in the manner that it was pulled and stretched out. I suspect a sasquatch. ,The town dump is located on the north side of Boktuklo Mt. just half a mile south of Honobia. From the Girl  s Camp intersection  go half a mile south  turn left on the first road. Cross the river and go about one quarter mile to the dump. There are other entrances to the dump  but this one is the one where I removed boulders that had been placed in the road in an apparent attempt to block it. (This was not a rock slide situation.)And trees broken in a series  not all at the same time  along the road leading to the dump.  This is  also  the location where I found  above a rock outcropping  a large western red cedar that had been used as a lookout tower by something of great weight that came up from the river. There were no trails leading to the tree. It was obstructed by green briars and there were bleached out  undisturbed leaves on the ground everywhere except the stone outcropping that extended about ten feet or so down to the river. There was a heavy wear pattern on one side of the tree as if it had been used as a ladder.  From that vantage point in the tree  traffic on Indian Hwy. and traffic on the road to the city dump could be viewed. (This lookout was not situated over a game trail.) ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40079,yes
3277,The BFRO sponsored an expedition to investigate a series of reports of bigfoot related activity in Le Flore County  Oklahoma. I was part of the BFRO team undertaking the investigation. While walking down a remote access road at about 9 00 PM on Sunday  30 September 2001  all three team members present heard a loud pop against a nearby tree trunk. A rock had been thrown with considerable force and had hit high up on the tree trunk. We heard the rock fall to the ground after hitting the tree. We stood and looked intently with night vision spot lights towards a mountain just north of us  but saw nothing unusual. Although this was the only rock throwing incident I experienced  other similar occurences were experienced by different team members over the next several days. The local land owners had reported repeated incidents like this and recently had to clean a bunch of fist size rocks from the roof of one of their buildings located at the foot of that same mountain. Nothing out of the ordinary occurred at my location during the next nightâ€™s observations. On the third night  however  I had a startling experience. We had been broadcasting bigfoot vocalizations provided by the BFRO  hoping to hear vocal responses. I was stationed about a mile away from the broadcast site  up a major creek in the area. At 7 54 PM and again at 8 20 PM  I heard sounds similar to the ones we had been broadcasting. We had heard numerous owls and coyotes  etc.  and I had studied recordings of common animal vocalizations so as not to mistake them for bigfoot related vocalizations. The two sets of calls that I heard were very distant  but definitely similar to the bigfoot vocalizations the BFRO has recorded near Lake Tahoe  California. At 9 30 PM  we began our sound broadcasting protocol for the evening. Before dark  I had deployed a primate pheromone chip supplied by BFRO curator Dr. Greg Bambenek. I was sitting about 30 or 40 yards away from that chip in an elevated observation platform about 15 feet off the ground. Suddenly  at about 11 30 PM  I heard heavy foot falls in the brush to my east. They startled me because they sounded as if they were only 20 or 30 yards away and I did not hear them approach. The animal moved slowly north and south  pacing back and forth. I strained in my night vision equipment to see something  but all I saw was brush. This behavior went on and on. It was just pacing back and forth  moving very slowly. Occasionally I heard big sticks breaking under the foot falls. My mind began to race. Maybe it was a bear  or was it a sasquatch? I turned off my radio. I did not want a radio check with the creature only yards away. I kept sweeping the area alternately with night vision equipment and then natural vision. I watched for brush movement to indicate the location of the creature  but could see none. This was very puzzling since the animal sounded so close. Occasionally it would walk directly toward me. It sounded so close I leaned out and looked directly under my platform because I thought it might have slipped up to the base of the tree I was in. It did this 3 or 4 times over the next two hours.   As 1 30 AM approached (the time the last series of broadcasts were scheduled to begin)  I made up my mind that I would radio the broadcast team and ask them to walk up and escort me out when the broadcasts were finished. I realized the radios might drive the animal away  but at that point I considered it a safety issue because all I knew was that some large mammal had been intently watching me for hours. I was still not sure if I was dealing with a bear or a bigfoot. The steps had been so slow and deliberate that no cadence could be detected to determine whether it was 2 footed or 4 footed. While I was talking to the broadcast team  the animal moved slowly south and then I did not hear it anymore. I waited through the last set of broadcasts  and after the last one  the team called and said they were on the way up. I had heard nothing for about the last hour  so I figured the animal had moved off  but I was not sure where it was. The team made a couple of radio checks on their way to my location. They were flashing a laser light in the tree tops and kept asking if I could see it. After one of these calls  I heard a loud  Plooorp  sound about 40 yards behind me and slightly to the west. My first thought was that a bear had rolled a large rock near the waterâ€™s edge. After a few seconds  I heard a more  splashy   plooorp  sound followed immediately by foot falls racing down the water in the creek bed about 25 yds to my west. It raced past my location and up the stream about 30 yards  and then I heard nothing. There were about 12 splashing footsteps that sounded DEFINITELY BIPEDAL over a period of about 4 or 5 seconds. Upon later investigation in the daylight with BFRO curator R. N.  we discovered that the creek bed was covered with boulders from 6  to 18  in diameter. The distance from the only pool deep enough to have been the source of the original sound to the place where the standing water ends was a distance of about 70 yds. I can offer no other suitable explanation for this event other than bigfoot. It covered more rough area quicker than anything I can conceive. The area was scouted in the daylight  but no tracks or other evidence was discovered. The next night I climbed the very same tree  but had no unusual occurrences at all except a whinnying noise we had heard before and which we had concluded during the day to be a screech owl. My sense of the situation is that the animal that walked around me may have been drawn to the area by the sound blasting  or that it may have simply happened by. Once in the area  it probably was stopped by the pheromone scent. It may have detected me while looking for the source of the pheromone scent.  I also had the zip lock bag ( that had contained the chip ) on the platform with me. It was still quite pungent.  The creature was obviously able to move stealthily since I did not hear it until it was very close.  Maybe it made noise for so long trying to draw me down from my perch  who knows? Having departed to the south  it took up a position straight downwind of both me and the pheromone chip. I made a serious mistake by picking a tree directly downwind from the chip. Perhaps if I had chosen a position 50 yds cross wind  I would not have been seen or scented. I would do it differently in the future. At any rate  this animal took up a position directly behind me  placing itself in my blind spot behind the tree I was in. It was also in my back track; maybe it hoped I would leave the same way I came. I think it waited there  still watching me  until it heard the team approaching it from behind. Then  having an unknown presence in front of it and behind it  it panicked and ran straight up the rocky creek bed where it would leave no tracks. This behavior indicates an animal that is extremely intelligent  curious  and observant. It apparently had acute night vision. It also was not afraid of me  even after hearing radio communications  a very unnatural sound. I believe it was waiting for me to come by. There is the possibility that two different animals were involved  but that would not be my first guess. Perhaps others will be able to draw more from these events. I submit this record with the hope that it will prove helpful to future efforts. ,Land owners request that no directions be given. ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40079,yes

3279,Having had the benefit of finding a footprint when I was 13  my interest in bigfoot has led me to privately research the subject for many years. Thanks to your website I have been able to concentrate much of my attention on Oklahoma  since it has many more reports than my native Kansas  which has not been updated. On that note  myself and some other interested participants traveled to Leflore County in SE Oklahoma in an attempt to find some evidence  since this area is a hotspot of reported activity. Traveling to Honobia  we met a few of the inhabitants who were more than willing to provide us with information and possible locations where we might have some type of encounter. Please note that this is near the exact location that the Mysterious Encounters team filmed the Oklahoma Wildman episode. We too visited the house where they set up operations and noted how the previous occupants had left so abruptly that most of their possessions remained in the home  including a refrigerator full of spoiled food. Having set up camp we proceeded to stay up until near dawn  occasionally playing the Sierra bigfoot vocalizations  and patroling the area. Nothing was seen or heard throughout the night. The following day  while walking through the area  myself and one other located three full footprints and one potential track on a road leading up the hillside toward the top of the hill. While we did not apply plaster-of -paris to the tracks or accurately measure them  we did take photos. Using dollar bills as gauges to measure the length not only of the footprint  but also the stride between tracks  I would quite accurately estimate that the prints themselves were over sixteen inches long and the stride nearly five and a half feet. These tracks were located on a sloping road traveling upwards at nearly 40 degrees. Also of note  I understand that many people will disregard such tracks as those of bears or other large animals  but we also took photos of bear tracks we found near the Little River located nearby. Anyone who has any idea of what animal tracks look like can tell the difference. They are not even close. These tracks were huge. ,Just off of State Highway 144 one mile east of Honobia.

3280,On April the 17th 2004 I was Turkey hunting in the Ouachita National Forest with my girl friend and my brother. I had crossed the creek that ran along side an old log road that headed up the mountain to the west  when I decided to hunt the creek bottom that afternoon. As I set up my Turkey blind and got settled in to do some hunting I blew one of my locater calls it was a screaming hawk. After sitting there for about 15 minutes I turned my head and noticed a burnt looking tree about 50 yards to my left. I raised my shotgun and looked at it with my scope when I realized what I was seeing was not a tree but a large creature like I have never seen before  it stood about eight feet tall  had charcoal dark color hair covering its entire body. [The hair] was about three inches long and coarse in appearance. It was watching me as well as I was watching it. Its eyes were reddish-brown in color  it had long arms and walked up right never taking its eyes off me  and I never took my eyes off of it. This thing was just looking at me as if it had been watching me for some time. This thing scared me pretty bad if you can give me a call I will give you more details. This thing is out there this is not a joke what I saw was Real! I have never been scared of anything in the woods but this thing was massive in size and I can say this thing scared me  and I have not been back in the woods before daylight since. , ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40079,yes
3281,This was our third trip to the LeFlore county area.  We were aware of the BFRO reports from this area and decided to camp explore and just enjoy some time outside.  To become more familiar with the area we wanted to spend time in the Honobia Wildlife Area and the Ouchita Nat  l Forest.  We arrived late on October 22nd and just picked an easy place to access.  We set up camp in the Billy Creek campground.  At approximately 2330 hours Ann and I both heard an unusual sound.  Ann described the sound as being a cross between an elk and an elephant.  She heard the sound twice and thought it came from west of us on a slight ridge.  I heard the sound four times and thought it came from the creek bottom.  I would describe the sound as having a hollow quality with two distinct pitches.  The sound lasted about three seconds with the first half being the higher pitch.  Our dog was acting rather nervous for a short time before and during the sounds.  After the sounds he settled down and went to sleep.  We didn  t hear anything else.  We were the only ones in the campground that night.  The next night there were three other tents.  We heard nothing that night.  We  re not saying that this was a bigfoot  but we  ve spent quite a bit of time outdoors and haven  t heard anything like this previously. Being rural people we  re aware of the different wildlife sounds but  this was a new one to us. ,Billy Creek campground ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40079,no
3282,As reported to Roger Roberts. The witness  age 18  observed one bigfoot  slowly jogging  across Holson Valley Road; which is two lane blacktop  west of Cedar Lake. He described the creature as  military brown  in color  with long matted hair  heavy set  over 6 ft tall   fat head  and whiskers. The witness  s total time of observation was approximately 10 seconds. The area is devoid of houses and is somewhat remote. The creature never looked in his direction  and continued to  jog  up hill on two legs after crossing the road. ,West on Holson Valley Road  west of Cedar Lake. ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40079,yes
3283,I was reading some of your sighting reports of other people who have had an encounter with one of these creatures. I also have seen one back in 1986 in Bowie County  Texas while deer hunting with my Nephew late one November afternoon. Since that time I live in LeFlore County  Oklahoma.Last Spring while Turkey Hunting with my brother at Big Cedar OK he had an encounter with one that was about 8  -9   tall this thing shook him up pretty bad. I got a call from a guy at Big Cedar Thursday Jan. 26th last week saying a Road Crew that was working on a bridge on highway 63 East of Big Cedar had found some large tracks of some kind of man or Something. My Nephew and I went there yesterday and seen the tracks they look real my nephew took some pictures  and I contacted Jerry Heston and told him about this. The last two or three years there has been a number of sightings around this area. Myself being an avid hunter and outdoorsman I have desided to hunt for one of these creatures  not to shoot or kill one  but to prove they do exist. If I can be of any help please let me know. Alot of the people that are doing research on these things are good people  but some of them don  t know the first thing about the outdoors or this creature. A few of us have started our on investigation due to it taking so long to get someone down here like when these tracks were found. , ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40079,yes
3284,Me and a long time friend were camping in the woods near Heavener  Okla by Tram Ridge Road.  About 5 15pm we heard what sounded like an ape at the zoo. We sat and listened to this for about two minutes and then there were knocks coming from the area of the creek below us. We thought it was a woodpecker at first but the knocks were to slow and too loud for it to be that. We had read where that is the way they communicate so we decided to try for ourselves. I really don  t think this was a good thing. When started to bang two logs together. The knocks got closer to us and we heard more knocks start so we stopped. About one to two minutes after that some rocks came flying into camp and these were not small stones that you could throw a long ways. These were about 4 to 5 inches in diameter. As soon as it stopped we were on guard for the rest of the day and that night just got worse. We went to bed about 10 30pm and all sounded good until there were walking sounds outside our tent and the sounds of what we thought was something smelling along the seam of the tent and around the windows of the tent. After that night we heard nothing the next day. , ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40079,no
3285,We started a trip into the Horse thief Springs Trail from Cedar Lake on Saturday afternoon at 1730. We had a late start due to drive from Texas and waking up two teenagers on a Saturday.  We were in a hurry to make the springs before dark  so we pressed pretty hard on the trail...we had 7 miles to cover quickly. We had planned on hiking The Old Military Road Trail several miles to the west  but audibled to this one due to available water sources.  I made camp on the other side of the Ouachita National Recreation Trail where it intersects with the shorter HST...this was about 200 yards past where a small water flow crosses the ONRT.  About 2100  my son  s friend stated   What was that?   My son looked at me and asked if I heard the noise.  I wasn  t paying attention because I was making our dinner.  Another call immediately came...it was a series (3-4) of high-pitched whoops.  They were very clear and distinct.  My best guess would be within 1/2 mile to our north. At one point my son said   It sounds like a monkey!  This continued for a while and eventually we heard the  whoops  start coming from our south.  The ones from the south sounded like they were coming from past Hwy 1 because we could hear an occasional car pass and it sounded much closer.  The calls seemed to go on into the night intermittently.  I finally fell asleep around 0230 in the morning and was up around 0600.  No other vocalizations were noted during the morning or hike out. ,Horesthief Springs Trail near Hwy 1. ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40079,no
3286,We were hiking up a ridge above a friends cabin. We had stopped to catch our breath and check out some stone formations. After about 10 minutes waiting for one of my friends to come back from a possible stone formation  I was looking uphill and saw a head peaking around a hickory tree and brush. It was moving back and forth from around the tree. There was a lot of dead tree fall and vegetation between us but it appeared to be sitting on the ground. I could see a face  head and shoulder of what appeared to be of a primate. I asked the friend closest to me to come behind me slowly and look over my right shoulder. I pointed in the direction of the animal and he about fell over. The eyes were dark and the face appeared to be covered in hair/fur. The head was crested and covered in fuzzy hair. The hair came down the head and became longer as it transitioned into the shoulder area. The hair was an Irish Setter red. There was a very short neck area. It was100 to 125 feet away from me.  It appeared to be smaller than me. I am 6 feet tall 280 pounds. After watching it for about 5 minutes (as it watched me)  my other friend started to return and it started walking back away from us. I lost sight of it  but it reappeared a short distance to the left of the previous position and began peaking at us from over the top of the vegetation it was hiding behind. This time the peeking was very quick with a minute between appearances. We watched this for about 15 more minutes and then did not see it again. ,Near Highway 144  outside the Kiamichi Mountain town of Honobia ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40079,yes
3287,We were on our way to a rental cabin (Cloud 9 cabins)  in Smithville Oklahoma on Oct 1  2009 on Beechton Road (dirt road) at about 4 30pm. The weather conditions were overcast  temp around 60  no rain  daylight  we were driving about 30 mph. No cars  houses  people for miles around. As we were heading to the west from Mena  Ak about a 1 Â½ miles or so from the turnoff to the cabins  my wife Debbie smelled something sweet but dead smelling at the same time. About a minute after that  we went around a turn in the road  and saw an animal move across the road from the left to the right  into the brush and trees.  This animal moved in a very fluid motion on all fours. It was dark grey or black  short hair  about 36â€ long and about 24â€ high. It had no tail  no collar on its neck. The head was completely round about the size of a large grapefruit. There were also no ears or snout visible. It ran by moving its legs back and forth  not together as in how a cat would run fast. We could not identify it. We thought we might have seen a baby Sasquatch  going to its mother in the woods. We felt the mother might have crossed first  before we came to the curve. We do know what it was not. It was not a dog  cat  bear  bobcat  skunk  wolverine  rat  rabbit  skunk  or anything else that we have ever seen  and we do spend a lot of time in the woods  hunting and camping. The total time we saw the animal was about 3 seconds  and we stopped to look were it had entered into the woods  but saw nothing. What was more striking in my mind was  if it were to stand up. It would have looked like a small dark person. (keep in mind we didnâ€™t see the face) We still think to this day that is/was a baby Sasquatch. When we got back home in Missouri  we looked on the internet for baby gorillas  to compare what they looked like to this animal  and there was a close match. , ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40079,yes
3288,On the evening of January 4  2012  my fiance  her grandmother  and I were driving back to Broken Bow from my fiance  s baby appointment in Talihina  Ok. I had just awakened from a nap-i was riding in the back seat-and I looked out the window to see about where we were. I had noticed that there was a power line trail on a hill that was near the hwy we were driving on. Next to a power line pole was the silhouette of something large. I say silhouette because the sun was on it  s way to setting  causing the side that was facing me of whatever was standing there to be shadowed. Within a second of me spotting it  it ducked to it  s left into the wood line. This was not a bear-the shoulders were clearly defined and it looked to large to be a person.  Now a short background of myself  I am prior military  have never done drugs  and have been around woods all my life. My attention to detail is immaculate and I know when something is out of place. I know what I saw and will stand by my story. Also as an avid bigfoot follower/believer I have a habit of checking power line trails when passing by. To me  there is no other explanation-i have no doubt that was sasquatch. ,I had just woken up from a nap but I believe it was 5-10 miles from the  three sticks  monument going toward Octavia ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40079,yes
3289,My wife and I were in Broken Bow  OK on Sun. the 18th of March 2012. We live in Arkansas about 20 miles west  but on a whim decided to take a 2 hr detour north on HWY 259 and cut across Rich Mt. Rich Mt is the highest point in the Ouachita Mts. I had commented about how squatchy the area looked and my wife replied that we would not see one in the day time. Well  about 45 minutes later she saw one. We were about a mile south of Talimena Scenic By-Way on 259  right on the west end of Rich Mt. She said it was about 35-40 ft off the road walking behind a tree. She described it as being 9-10 ft tall with stringy hair of varying shades of brown. She noticed it was bipedal with long arms swinging in the usual   squatchy   way. She was very firm when I asked if perhaps it was a bear and said that she knew what she saw. As my luck goes  we were at a point where the road was hairpin curves with no shoulders and no way to turn around. I guess I  ll have to wait for my first sighting. One thing she mentioned was noticing the muscles in the arms and legs. If this was a man in a suit they went to some trouble to pull it off. ,It was approximately 1 mile south of the 259 and 88 intersection in the curviest part of the road.

3290,I was driving down highway 59 from Heavener to Poteau. I turned right on co road 133 and about 100 ft onto the street on the right side of the road was a huge figure standing bout 7ft+ on the side of the road kind of hunched over and I guess when it saw my lights it spooked em cause it ran off into the trees I slowed down to see what it was don  t know where it went after that cause it spooked me. , ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40079,yes
3291,We went to LeFlore County to trail ride and during the trip there my husband and I joked about the possibility of seeing one. I even went to Honobia  OK with my daughter to the Bigfoot Festival in 2011 and learned a great deal.  I also want to say that I have nothing to gain by fabricating a tall tale about Bigfoot.  I have hesitated about reporting this encounter because my best friend of 40 years doesnâ€™t believe me.  But I assure you  this really happened.  I am so excited about the encounter that we are returning to the area with our horses in a few weeks to do some investigating of our own and to trail ride some more since it rained on us all weekend this last time. We went to the Cedar Lake  Ouachita National Forest in OK.  The forecast called for rain most of the weekend but we had high hopes of doing a lot of trail riding on our horses.  My parents pulled their RV and we hauled my Dadâ€™s horse along with ours in our stock trailer. And our camp sites were on the edge of the campgrounds  right next to the forest.  Saturday morning we went trail riding  and kept noticing a strange smell. (no one else from the camp was riding at this time  the 3 of us were alone in the woods) Smelled like musky skunk.  And a few times our horses refused to travel up certain trails. After some encouragement they finally went on.  Later that evening about 7 00pm my husband and I went to feed the horses at the camp site where our trailer was parked and saw a herd of deer passing through our camp site.  They stepped just inside the tree line and stopped.  We watched them for about 2-3 minutes then they ran off.  I took some hay down to the woods and put it on the trail hoping they would come back.  Thatâ€™s when I noticed the skeletal remains of what I thought may have been a deer.  After that  my husband and I went for a walk in the woods to gather firewood before it got too dark. We didnâ€™t get very far when my husband asked me if I had seen that? I said  see what?  He said that he saw something big and black dart across and down a hill. I told him that I didnâ€™t see anything cause I was looking at the ground for firewood.  He was feeling very uneasy and was ready to get out of the woods so we went back to camp with a few sticks of firewood.  When we returned to camp  I was feeling kind of ornery  and decided to play upon my husbands â€œuneasinessâ€.  I took a branch and went inside the tree line and made some â€œwood knocksâ€.  It was getting dark so we got a small fire going in the fire pit.   And we were all sitting in front of the RV and talking  when we started hearing coon dogs baying as though they treed a coon.  (Could have been coyotes  I have never heard coyotes sound quite like this though.)  So Iâ€™m thinking  â€œGreat! We have to listen to the coon hunters all nightâ€.  My momma said that she heard a faint blood curdling scream/moan while those dogs were howling. So we made a few more wood knocks and the dog howling stopped and we never heard it again. Then shortly after that  we heard something walking in the woods  twigs breaking and leaves rustling.  We thought it was deer so we went on about our business telling ghost stories and bigfoot stories when all of a sudden  the trees in front of us started shaking violently! It sounded like something very big was coming thru the forest towards us!  Like a dinosaur movie where you see the forest moving and hear breaking of branches long before the dinosaur jumps out.  It was like that only we were not at the movies!  This was real!  We were all frozen in our lawn chairs! No one could move! We kept waiting for whatever it was to jump out at us! We could hear branches cracking  crunching and rattling and I saw the tops of the trees shaking in a circular motion.  Then it stopped.  And the forest was silent. We had a spot light and we thought about shining it in the trees but we were all to frightened!  My husband doused the fire and we all went inside the RV shortly after that.  The next morning we walked down to the trees that were shaking to look for footprints. (about 20-30â€™ downhill) We didnâ€™t see anything for all the ground clutter  leaves and pine cones  twigs and pine needles.  I looked at the two trees that were shaking and they were fairly close together  Iâ€™d say about 10-12â€ apart at the base  they were 30â€™-40â€™ tall and about 12â€-18â€ diameter.   We also looked for fallen limbs and branches and there was nothing on the ground that wasnâ€™t already there. Iâ€™m HOOKED! I want more encounters  I want to see one! ,Cedar Lake equestrian park ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40079,yes
3292,Went camping in the Ouachita mountains near Talemina Scenic Drive.  At 3 39 we all woke up due to the sound of something knocking a tree behind us. Was in the distance but close enough to make you on edge. We thought it was a woodpecker and brushed it aside. 10 minutes later we heard the noise on our right side of the tent. The knocking was in triples such as â€œ knock  knock  knockâ€ then a pause and the 3 knocks again  but in every direction the knocking had a slight variation. The knocking was coming from all sides of our tent  as if there was something surrounding us communicating. Knocks has slight variations in how quick they were  but all of them had the triple knocking. The closest knock was about 50 yard uphill from us. The close one made everything stop in the woods  it was raining and it stopped along with the wind. This is weird  considering it was super windy up there the whole time we stayed  except that one moment. We all agreed to not camp that spot again. ,[camp site near Horsethief Picnic Grounds off Talemina Scenic Drive] ,Le Flore,23,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40079,no
3293,I have lived in the area east of hwy 259 and hwy 63 also known as Big Cedar for 36 years. I was outside my home and I heard 7-10 howlings to the north. It was a sound I  ve never heard in the area before. I  ve spent considerable time in these woods. Hunting fishing as a teen I would camp alone with my squirrel dog. The only time I  ve heard anything like it was on TV during the big foot shows. I wasn  t going to make a report but while reading some of the reports. I came across repot #34657. In early summer 2007 I was headed north from Big Cedar on 259 and saw a tall dark figure cross the hwy about 1/2 mile ahead of me. It was one solid dark color from head to feet. Bipedal with long arms. Extremely dark brown to black. In almost the exact same place as seen in report #34657. Time was around 10 am. ,Near hwy 63 right at the OK/AR state lines.

3294,I had just got off work approximately 60 miles away and had been driving home. I saw something (I  m not saying it was a bigfoot ) large bending over (its back facing me). It looked like it was picking something up off the highway that runs over the bridge. It was pretty different than I had imagined they looked like  though. It was really tall  even bending over the way it was. It had long  straight brown hair  though  like a dog or something. I always pictured them to have black hair  but this was brown. There were things hanging in the hair  little sticks and undergrowth looking stuff  and it was really dirty. The only other thing I really remember is the smell as I drove by  it was awful! I was driving my convertible with the top down  and the smell of what ever that was - well  I can  t even describe how bad it was. That  s really all I saw  etc. I was driving about 60 mph and after I saw whatever that was  I sort of got the creeps and sped home and ran in to tell my husband what happened. I didn  t even put the top back up on the convertible. The bridge that I saw whatever that was on is only about a quarter of a mile from my house. So  needless to say  I  m not real happy about coming home from work after dark anymore. Also  I know this sounds weird  but about a week and 1/2 before the sighting  we kept hearing the strangest scream (that  s the best way to describe the noise ) and it was not one of our calves or any of our livestock  and after about 2 days of hearing this noise  it finally stopped. The next day  we found a little baby goat with the umbilical cord still attached and dragging the ground all alone - no mother goat to be found anywhere. We found him all alone in the wooded area back behind our house. When we found him  he was terrified  he didn  t make a noise or anything - it took us hours to catch him. He finally bleats (cries) now  and it sounds nothing like the noise we heard before we found him. We have also lost 4 baby kittens in the last month  they seem to have just disappeared. We do live way out in the country  though. It  s possible that anything could have carried them off or had them for dinner  but I feel like it  s worth mentioning. ,Deep Fork River. ,Lincoln,16,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40081,yes
3295,My wife  daughter  son  and I were fishing at a lake near Guthrie Oklahoma.  It was the end of May and we decided to do some night fishing but arrived well before dark.  We got our poles in the water and were enjoying being outdoors when some doves started calling back and forth.  Our daughter began imitating the calls and did a fairly good job of it. As it began to get dark  I attempted to light my old Coleman lantern but couldn  t get it to generate so we packed up and moved over closer to the boat ramp where there was some light from a street lamp.  Once it was dark  the noise from the frogs and insects was loud enough for us to comment about.  A couple of owls also began hooting back and forth and our daughter began imitating them too. This went on for some time until one of the owls flew right in front of us - close enough to see it in what little light we had.  Almost as soon as the owl was past there was in incredible roar from the direction the owl came from. It was so loud and forceful that I felt it vibrate in my chest.  It lasted about 5 seconds and then it became dead silent.  No frogs  no bugs  nothing except my wife and daughter looking at me and asking  What the hell was that? It took a bit but the frogs and bugs slowly began their chorus again. I spent 21 years in the military and never in my travels heard anything like this. What ever made this noise had to be huge and it sounded angry.  I spent time in Central America and have heard Howler monkeys at close range. They are loud but never did one rattle my chest. We stayed a few minutes longer and then packed up and went home.  I  ve spent a lot of time outdoors in various parts of the world and have very seldom felt uneasy - this rattled me a bit. Our son had gone to the vehicle and fell asleep about 45 min earlier and didn  t wake up for this.  ,Near boat ramp on east side of the lake ,Logan,13,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40083,no

Less than a few seconds later I heard footfalls on the west side of house. He was 2 steps from fence around front pasture when I saw him. He pushed down top wire stepped over crossed front pasture in the time it took to say  what the heck  pushed down top wire stepped over in the center of pasture into slight ditch crossed road and disappeared into slightly west of where deer did.

3297,In June 2015  I  my wife  and son  were out at 10 00pm south of Pryor near low water dam on the Neosho river. As we drove the back roads  I stopped my truck and immediately heard a loud  ape like  sound coming from the tree line that was appropriately 15 yards to our left. We shone a light in the area for about a minute. I back my truck up 20 feet and stopped and we heard a second louder  ape like  sound from a second location in the tree line. The  ape like  sound was a short whooping noise. The second noise was loader and more aggressive sounding than the first noise. We stayed in the area for several hours with no other incident. ,Near low water dam  Pryor side  by Sportsman and Cherokee Heights. ,Mayes,2,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40097,no
3298,I was walking with my dog down a dirt road near my grandparents house. It was about 8pm and still light out. We were about 1/2 mile down the road when my dog started barking and going crazy. She would just stand between my legs and growl and bark  this is a big dog  a German Shepard. Finally I got her to calm down. I heard some grunting and moving around in the woods to our right  I figured it was a deer or wild hog. As I moved closer  I saw it raise up from behind a fallen tree. I  d say it was roughly 7   tall. I would guess it was 300-400 lbs  kinda reddish brown hair covering its body. Its face looked like a monkey in a way. I couldn  t move  my dog was going crazy trying to stay between me and what ever it was. It was only there for a flash. I know it turned and ran off and my dog gave chase to it  and I turned and ran home. About 30-45 minutes later  my dog came home  panting  but unhurt. I have heard all kinds of noises at night there all my life. They sound like a  whoomping  sound  kinda like a howler monkey I  ve seen on the Discovery Channel. ,Various ponds and fresh water creeks in the area.

3299,I was told by phone by a relative that three large manlike  hairy creatures were observed on a persons porch and yard. The man got his SKS and has allegedly shot one. Two others came out of the nearby forest and carried him away. That the FBI was called and samples of blood and hair have been taken for testing. My relative also told me that contractors who plant young pine seedlings are refuseing to go in near Honobia and plant trees. Today Jan 28  2000 we have had a very heavy snow and while I was home listening to the scanner I overheard a conservation between two Oklahoma game wardens talking about the incident. One told the other to be on the lookout for large manlike hairy creatures. They seemed very serious. They were talking about the same incident that I have mentioned above. This area is called the Honobia Wildlife area and is very very sparsly inhabited. The area of 875.000 acres is owned by a large timber company and as the loggers move in to cut there are sightings. , ,McCurtain,6,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40089,no
3300,While my son and I were camping in the Quachita National Forest on Oct 19 2001  in McCurtain County we discovered 4 large foot prints and one large hand print. We were off one of the logging roads that wind through out the forest. I came upon a area that had a very steep cut out along the bank off the road. This cut off had exposed the underlining strata  and I thought it would be a good time to show my son some geology of the area. The exposed strata was layered and I could show my son (18 years old) how the rock and soil was layered by water over thousands of years. We went up to the bank and was starting to show him the layers when suddenly my son said  Dad look at this print  it turned out that it was a very large hand print. After further investigation we found 4 large foot prints. The prints were in a single line and you could follow the prints for a space of roughly 15 -20 feet. We did not have a tape measure or ruler to measure accurately so every measurement is a guesstimation. The first print seen is a left foot  then comes right foot about two feet away  then comes left foot about 8 feet further up then about 3-4 foot away and slightly higher up the (what I will call for lack of a better term alluvial fan  because off this bank the soil and rock is washed down into a pattern like that off larger areas such as the sides of mountains  etc.) Following the left hand print comes another left foot print about 3 feet away  however this print only shows the toes and about 1/2 of the foot it appears to have been made while the foot was rotating off the ball and toes  and stopped at what with some caution I will call the arch. (I say that because there does not seem to be much if any arch at least like a normal human foot.) Following this print is another large print however this print seems to be out of place as that it is perpendicular to the others and headed further up the debris pile. After this the tracks stop. There are some others there that I think were at one time prints however they were deteriorated to the point where it would be impossible to ID. The material in this wash is a combination of small chat like material mixed with the native soil (clay based sandy loam). It is not a material that is condusive to holding any print of any kind for very long and they will be gone totally after the first rain. The track these prints and place was not a easy track for it was slightly up the debris pile and a fairly steep angle  my best guess why it would take this track was because the location of this place is in one of the few places in this area which has any open ground (not very large  but larger than the surrounding area) and as stated earlier it was right off one of the logging roads  so I guess he/it was walking along the bank to minimize his silhouette while treking along this open space next to the road. The next morning (Oct 20) we went back out there and we took some small sticks and placed hunters orange tape on the tops of the sticks then placed the sticks in the middle of the tracks so that we could get a visual on its track. We used one piece of tape to mark foot prints and used two pieces of tape to mark the hand print. This was so we could get a easier visual sight of what was going on. We then took the video camera and filmed the tracks and the track markers  so we have all this on video and you are welcome to view this  and in fact I can/will furnish a copy of the tape if interested in it. Just let us know if you wish to see it.  ,Coming south on Highway 259 you travel about 5 miles of the junction of 259 & 4 (which heads back to Smitville proper). On the east side of 259 you will see a low water crossing that crosses Mountain Fork river you follow that logging road 2 miles to the east. At the two mile mark the road Y  s back south there is a pond on the south side to mark this spot. You take this logging road about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile further and you will see the steep bank off the road on your right hand side (west). I will include more precise directions here below  Using the Smithville Quadrangle 7.5 minute topo map the UTM coordinates are as follows  Zone 15 347964E 3806266N This area sits between Hee Mountain which is to the south and Mountain Fork River which is north. ,McCurtain,6,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40089,no
3301,In November 1996 just a couple of days before thanksgiving my best friend and I were camping and deer hunting on Weyerhaeuser forestry land in SE Oklahoma the nearest town would be Smithville but even at that it would somewhere around 9 miles as the crow flies. (Land has since been sold to John Hancock Corp). This area is in the same general area as where my written report occurred. This area is used to grow soft pine trees for harvesting to grind into paper pulp. The total area is something around 800 000 acres. So you can imagine how big of an area this is. There are no homes or anyone living in this area at all  in fact you are not even allowed to build any permanent hunting cabins or such things. By this time of 1996 I had actually all but given up gun deer season  I was almost strictly a bow hunter. About 3 years before I was actually in a tree stand and had a bullet go over my head. Some idiot was out there somewhere (never seen him heard the shot but never seen the guy that pulled the trigger) anyway he was out there just taking pot shots. I had decided after that I would just stay with my bow hunting. However my buddy wanted me to go with him as he was alone  so I decided to go ahead and accompany him. The area that we camped in is an area that is very difficult to get to and rarely does anyone go into this area. You have to exit off a logging road and travel up this very steep clear cut that climbs up a small mountain. There is really not even a road as such that you have to travel along. At one time the loggers just took a dozer and cut a path the width of the dozer from the bottom of the mountain all the way up and then along the crest of the mountain. And this path is never maintained so it gets very rough and only a 4x4 can get through and even with that you have to drive at a speed little more than walking speed. This path travels about 3 miles and simply dead ends just at the start of the downward side of the mountain. Me and my buddy call it the dish. We call it that because you are traveling up this mountain in heavy forest make a curve then suddenly you are facing down and at the bottom is a area that very much resembles a satellite dish where it is void of trees and the concave shape of the ground gives the impression of a satellite dish. This clear area is about 30 feet or so in diameter. So anyway we make the journey up the mountain and take the treacherous path up to the dish. There we make our camp and it of course becomes our home away from home for the next few days. It was a bit odd this year because normally you see one or two hunting camps once you enter the area from the highway. But this time we seen not one camp or hunter. Now to take note the dish from the highway is 14 miles  now of course that is not straight line miles because you know how access and logging roads rarely run straight for any distance. On day 3 of our hunting trip we get up before daylight as usual and get ready to go out into nature and see if we find any deer. After all  that was why were there  even so I had seen nothing the previous two days but didnâ€™t really care because as usual I very much was enjoying myself with the flora and fauna. I am also very interested in geology and there is much to see in that area. To imagine that area at one time was a shallow sea never ceases to amaze me. I wish when I took my first geology course in college I would have changed my major and pursued that field further. Oh sorry there got off track didnâ€™t IïŠ. We decide which directions we were going and we plan for our rendezvous back at the dish for 12 noon. We walk together for about Â½ mile camp and there we split up my buddy continues to the west along the top of the mountain and I head south down the side of the mountain. Being that it was not yet daylight and these woods are very thick and dangerous to walk in during the daylight hours due to the rough rocky terrain I was not about to do any walking until first light so after we split I only walked about 10 yards or so and sat down and waited for a few more minutes until sun up. At sun up I get up and start my hunt  I normally am not a stalker for a couple of reasons to be a successful stalker you must have coordination to walk and not make noise also you really need a lot of stamina. I possess neither of those traits. So I normally hunt from some type of stand. But I had sat for several hours the evening before and was ready to move  plus I wanted to do some exploring into a saddle I had never been into before so this day I decided to stalk. NOTE  I am using the term â€œsaddleâ€ here and will continue using that term; however it really is not a saddle as such. A saddle is the gap between where 2 mountains run close together. This area is on the same mountain but it has two ridges (or fingers extending out away from the mountain) making a gap and valley in between these two parallel fingers much like a saddle. Imagine if you will  make a fist with your left hand  then after you make a fist extend your index and middle finger out like you are making the peace sign. Your hand is the mountain and your two extended fingers are these fingers that extend out from the mountain. The width of this finger is I am guessing somewhere around 150 yards  but could not see all the way through because of the trees (more on this further below). I will be walking down that eastern finger which in the above example would be your middle finger. Your index finger will be the western finger or ridge. (I hate using the term ridge it is too vague). The distance between these two fingers were only about 50 yards apart at the mountain and by the time you get out to the tips they are nearly a hundred yards apart. So the technically are not parallel either they do diverge some. And the length of the finger I am on is about 300 yards. The length of the western finger is about 370 yards. Never went up there so I have no clue how wide across it is. Also the crest of that finger is about 20 â€“ 30 yards higher than the one I am on. END OF NOTE I start walking down the mountain side and after about a half hour I reach the eastern finger of the saddle. I sit for a few minutes to rest and catch my breath before taking out down this finger of the saddle. On this finger I could view the saddle valley to my right and also could see the eastern side of the western finger of the saddle. From the top of the finger I was walking I could see very clearly down to the bottom of the saddle which was no more than 100 feet to the floor nearest the mountain and as you walked the top of the finger away from the mountain this finger sloped downward toward the valley so that by the time the finger ended the valley within the saddle was no more than 50 feet from the peak of the finger to the valley within the saddle. So from my 12 oâ€™clock position to 180 degrees to my right (clockwise) I had a totally unobstructed view. With the exception of the trees in the saddle valley. But I had a clear enough view that if a deer was in there or came through that valley there was no way I would miss seeing it. This particular course also gave me a good look at the western finger face although with many trees on it there were several spot that had no trees and the rock strata was exposed which would give me a chance to look at to see If I could distinguish the types of rock there. I could also watch the ridge top of the western finger and see anything coming over the top. Over to my right across the top of this finger is heavily wooded with mainly hardwoods however there were some pine trees among them. This is old growth trees some of the hardwood (oaks  hickory) are quite large. It is heavily wooded enough that even in the bright sun it is fairly dark in there only a few feet in. Not dark enough that you canâ€™t see but you certainly would not need sun glasses in there. It  just like up in the dish it gets dark in there long before the sun is fully set. There is very little under growth in this area because it is so sunlight challenged. And the spacing between trees are fairly wide so that if anything of any size moved through you would have no trouble sighting it. This tree line extends almost all the way to the edge of the finger. You would only have maybe 5 feet of space to walk the length of the finger clear of trees. From the edge of this finger I am on in some places are straight down into the valley below. The only way to get on this finger is from the direction I came or as I will speak to later would be from the very end or tip of this finger. So I slowly stalk down this finger  keeping just inside the tree line so as not to be exposed to the valley floor and the western finger. I stalk very slowly along in no hurry whatsoever. Understanding that stalking means walk a few steps stop  wait  and listen  and repeat. I stalk nearly the entire length of this finger and decide I need a break so I walk out of the tree line to a spot that is actually clear of trees (except for one tree about the diameter of basketball) for about an area the size of a large bedroom. There was this very fine looking stump there that actually looked like it was made for my fat butt and it was high enough that I did not even have to bend my knees very far to be sitting. I figured I would sit for a while and rest my tired legs then I would finish walking this finger all the way to the tip and look down it and into the valley across the way. Then head back because we were to hook back up at noon and by now it was 9 30 and I was a good 3 miles from camp and a very hard climb back up the mountain. (Why in the hell did I ever decide to walk down the damn mountain  I knew I would have to walk back up at some point)? As I was sitting on my fine stump I looked down the finger out to the tip. At the tip was a huge oak tree I am 5ft 10 and it would have took two of me to wrap my arms around this thing. As I was looking at this tree and trying to figure out how a tree can grow to that size in so little soil. I then notice just off to the right of this tree a figure walking up from below the tip of the finger. The figure was in bright sunlight so I immediately recognized it as walking on two feet. And he appeared to me to be walking with his head down. But my first thought was what a dumb ass. It is deer season and if you are in hunting you are required to wear blaze orange and this guy had none. Even if you are not hunting it is a good idea if youâ€™re out in the woods. Now granted I had only seen one human in 3 days and that was my hunting buddy. And even though there were no humans for miles I for one would never take a stupid chance like that. I guess I should mention also that during the deer gun season  logging operations cease and the loggers go home. The companyâ€™s do not want their employees getting plugged by some knucklehead hunter. So I knew that this guy was not a logger. Then the next question came to my mine how in the hell did this guy get there? There is no logging road in that direction for a very long way. And from the nearest road it is a long ass haul to that point. And that haul would not be easy at all in fact that area is inaccessible even by an ATV. The next thought no he is not a hunter he is not carrying a rifle nor does he have one slung on his shoulders. Now remember that all these thoughts were processed in my head in a matter of micro-seconds. While this guy was walking slowly up this slope to the top of this finger that I am on. Then the next though through my mind gosh that is a cone head (from the movie) with hair. Because his head was very pointy. Next thought my god those are big assed shoulders. Next thought why in the hell is he wearing a mink coat? WTF. Next thought did god forget to give this guy a neck? It looked to me as his head was attached directly to his shoulders. Then this guy finally reaches the top and stands directly besides that big oak I was looking at just moments ago. Next thought my god that is one big MF. I have seen many football games and some of those have been up in the nose bleed section and those guys even that high up look big. But this was different I am now 83 yards from this guy and he is the biggest person I have ever seen bar none. Then the big guy looks up and looks directly at me out in front of god and everyone. It was then I realized ok I am not looking at any man but not really animal either it didnâ€™t seem. Now let me attempt to explain what big guy did. Imagine yourself standing looking straight ahead at some target and right next to you and slightly in front of you to your right is a big tree. Your desire now is to get behind that tree with little movement as possible. What you would most likely do is simply lift your left foot and pivot 90 degrees counterclockwise on your right foot with your head and neck froze in place to watch your target while moving. That is what he done. Next thought do I have any clean underwear back at camp cause me thinks I need them. Then the flight or fight response kicked in on me but I forced myself to stop think and evaluate. I determined that at 83 yards (didnâ€™t know it was exactly 83 yards at that time I went and marked off the distance later)(I was actually guessing at the time 100 yards)there was no way no matter how fast he was  that he could cover that distance before I put at least 3 bullets in him. (However I thought later than may have only pissed him off as big as he was). But anyway when I assured myself there was no real danger I calmed down and started thinking clearly again. The big guy was now standing behind that oak watching me then suddenly he popped behind the tree and I couldnâ€™t see him. So at that point I very slowly got up and moved behind that little tree near me. Then I peeked around that basketball sized tree (BTW at that time I was beach ball size so you can see the tree really offered no concealment) to see what was happing. By the time I looked back up he was once again peeking out from behind the tree. Now this time I thought that poor guy is deformed somehow because there appeared to be some kind of growth just around and below his throat. Could not make it out but definitely could see the discoloration and could see that there was something there that didnâ€™t belong. I was straining as hard as I could to make out the facial figures of this guy but try as I might there was simply no way I could make out any details of his face. My one real regret in this whole experience. Anyway we just kind of stared at each other for a couple of seconds then he popped back behind the tree. So I done the same the best I could. Here I am in an area with trees the size of Volkswagens and leave to me to pick a sapling to hide behind. After a couple of seconds behind the tree I pop out my head donâ€™t see him but I stay in that position a couple of more seconds then the big guy pops out his head again and looks at me. Now I am really confused because the growth that seemed to be on his throat is now over on top of where a clavicle would be. I donâ€™t know what is going on it is just too far away for me to make out fine detail. Someone with better vision probably would have been able to make things out better. Now here it becomes surreal and I donâ€™t know if I can put into words the way the situation seemed to instantly change. One moment I am so tense you could not have driven a straight pin up my butt with a 16 lb sledge hammer. The very next second a calm came over me and somehow I just had a feeling that there was nothing to be concerned about. So while he was looking at me I purposely leaned my rifle up against the stump I was just sitting at with him watching me. I just got the distinct feeling (yes I know the least scientific thing in the world) that he knew that I meant no harm and had no intention of doing anything to him. Maybe not maybe I am just reading more into that than I should. For lack of a better word we basically played peek-boo for another two minutes popping back and forth behind the trees. I just got a feeling he would have liked to have gotten a closer look at me just like I wanted to with him. Of course that was never going to happen. I think we may have kept doing that for a while longer but something happened that changed the circumstance. After a total of just about 3 minutes he very suddenly snaps around the other direction? I was thinking what the heck. Then I heard what he heard very large SNAP coming from the woods on top of this finger. I peed. Then the big guy turns and keeping the tree between me and him he simply walks off. He did not run or even walk particularly fast  he was walking a bit faster leaving than he did walking in but not in any panic. I figured if it was something that made him want to leave the area I better figure out quick what that made that noise. So I pick up my rifle and immediately start scanning. I want so badly to walk over to the tip to see if I can a glimpse of big guy. But I donâ€™t dare until I resolve this issue. After a couple of minutes of searching and listening to the noise I finally track to the source of the noise maker. A frigging tank rat. Damn I missed a possible chance to get a better look at big guy because of a dang tank rat. (Donâ€™t bother looking that species up that is my personal term for an armadillo). As stated above after the incident I walked off the distance and also solved one of the mysteries. The abnormal growth on big guy was not on big guy at all. It was on the tree it was a viral knot about the size of softball. I am 5â€™ 9/10  standing under the knot I could barely touch the bottom edge of the knot with my fingers standing on my tip toes and arm extended as far as I could. I found no tracks what so ever even though I knew the exact location of where he walked up and back from  but the ground was hard pan and even a D9 bull dozer would have been hard pressed to leave any marks/tracks in that ground. ,Can show on a topo map ,McCurtain,6,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40089,yes
3302,I was with a friend of mine behind his grandmas house. We had seen some dead fish near a pond broke in half so we went back later that day to look to see what might have caused it. We went about 100 yards in the woods when my friend had to go use the bathroom so he walked away from me when I heard a noise off to the right. I looked and see something looking around a tree about 50 to 75 yards away. I could make out fur on the outline of the shape it looked like it was about 8 feet tall. I seen it take a step and then I took off running back to the house. ,Was on Craig road in the woods behide a friends house I can not remember the house number ,McCurtain,6,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40089,yes
3303,My wife and I traveled from our home in the Dallas area for a 5 day trip to Hochatown  OK on Oct 26  2020. It had rained all day and had gone to drizzle by the time we arrived at our cabin around 4 30 pm. We unlocked the cabin and went inside and looked around and then went out right before 5 to start unloading our SUV. My wife grabbed some items and headed inside. Right as she got inside I heard a siren go off in the area of Beavers Bend State Park to warn about water being released from the dam. Immediately I heard a load deep growl. After a few seconds the growl turned into a deep howl. This went on for about thirty seconds and was immediately followed by a loud high pitched scream. This was followed wooooing sounds that lasted about 2 minutes. My wife came out while this was going on. We didn  t discuss it as I didn  t want to tell her what all I had heard. We grabbed up some items and went into the cabin. Upon coming back outside the sound was gone. I heard the siren go off many more times while we were there but never heard any other sounds. I am an army veteran and also former scoutmaster and have spent a lot of time in the woods but have never heard a combination of sounds like this. I  m still not certain if this actually was one or a coincidence of several animal calls occurring one after the other. My wife thought the woooing sound was wind blowing in the forest when we discussed this after we got home. But at the time there was little to no wind blowing and we never heard that again although it blew quite a bit as it rained the majority of time we were there. I originally sent this sound combination to Cliff Barackman and mentioned the Ohio howl and after looking it up it did sound similar to that. At the time I hadn  t really thought much about Bigfoot since back when I was in junior high in the 1970  s but after this have become really interested in it after this. ,The cabin was located on Rose Lane at the border with Beavers Bend State Park.

3304,My husband and I rented a yurt in Beavers Bend State Park on July 15  2022. Our Yurt sits directly on the Mountain Fork River. We stayed up until midnight and headed to bed. Around 2 am we woke to the sound of 6 or 7 consecutive howls over a 3 minute time span. It was very loud and east of our yurt. It was then silent. 30 minutes later we heard 3 loud hollering vocalizations much closer in the other direction  to the west of us. We have spent a lot of time in the woods. This is a sound weâ€™ve never heard before. It was not a bear growl. It was not a coyote or a bobcat. This was loud. ,.

3305,Me and my kids was traveling to Idabel Ok. June 19 2009. We took I-40 to Heneretta Ok. and then went South on the Indian Nation Turnpike  when my daughter 17yrs. said  mom I think I just seen Bigfoot or something walking into the woods  I asked her what was it and she stated that whatever she saw looked like a man but had brownish hair all over it  s body. I asked her did she see it  s face and she said she could only see the back of it  s head walking into the trees  she said it caught her attention because the trees in that area didn  t have branches or leaves on the bottom part of the tree only at the top  so she could see it real good. I didn  t think much about it until we were on our way back home and as we approached the area where she said she saw something I noticed a sign that said    Eufaula Exit  and then I remembered seeing a special on cable about Bigfoot sightings in Oklahoma and one of the places that talked about was Eufaula. ,We were traveling South on the Indian Nation Turnpike and my daughter was sitting behind the drivers seat looking out the window  so she was looking East. ,McIntosh,2,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40091,yes
3306,A hairy bi-pedal creature carrying a calf or deer carcass over its left shoulder crossed the road from East to West  approximately 150 yards in front of my pick-up truck during a brief rain storm. A part-time rig hand with me in the truck also witnessed the creature. The following day we found several partial footprints along the creek bank on the West side of the road.

3307,On the evening of 3/24/18 my wife  my youngest son  and I was fishing at Paul  s Valley lake. We had been there 30 mins or so fishing when I decided to rig a bass line. I had paused cause I heard some rustling in the woods across the road from us. My wife asked what was wrong I answered nothing just some noise. I know there is big cats in the area but I felt as if we was being watched not the first time at this spot to feel that way. Well this day it was odd the noise was rustling and then we went back to fishing. I went to change bait for my bass pole when it happened again. Then as we was talking another noise happened then we all watched a tree of good size push to the side then fall. She looked at me in awe  I said to them load up there is only one creature that pushes trees that big over. No bears are in this area. As they loaded I kept watching the woods for movement. They was done asking me to let in and let us leave. ,Paul  s Valley lake off of E 1530 Rd at N 3250 Rd.  North side of lake. ,Garvin,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40049,yes
3308,I live outside of Mannford Okla. in Creek county.6 miles south on Highway 48. By 87th place. I was outside about midnight September 8th 2009. I was talking on my cell phone out in the driveway of Our house. There are a few trailers around Us and the one directly behind Us keep their porch light on most nights. The moon was very bright and there were clouds but mostly a clear sky. I was chatting on the phone when I noticed movement that was shaped like a man walking across the field in front of some medium sized trees...The head was about halfway up to the top of the trees  which would have made them about 7-8 feet tall. I told the persons that I was on the phone with and then preceeded in telling someone in the house to turn Our back lights on...I saw the being being followed by a smaller or a hunched over second being. They crouched into the tall grass and then I lost sight of them until they walked off into the darkness and more trees...all I could see was a dark outline and the gait was very apelike..arms swinging at the sides...Their body seemed to turn at the waist to look my way... There have been an abundance of Bigfoot sightings in this area the 2 years We have lived here. We often hear screaming in the woods. The last incident was last Summer for about a week. ,Off highway 51 that heads out of Tulsa okla.

3309,My friend and I were leaving her house.  We decided to check out a tree in her yard that we thought we had seen something in about 2 weeks before.  The tree was about 60 yards from her house and close to the road.  We drove down to the tree and I had my bright lights on and was about 50 ft away from the tree.  We saw something huge and white sitting on a branch of the tree.  I saw the head and shoulders.  The shoulders were broad and it didn  t look like it had a neck.  My friend saw two legs dangling down.  The legs were hairy and were moving.  The head and shoulders were moving slightly back and forth like it was getting ready to jump down.  My friend screamed and shouted  go  go  go .  I was in shock  but managed to put the car in reverse and backed out as fast as I could and drove off.  I called my brother on my cell phone and my friend called her mother and told her not to come out of the house. ,From Lawton Ok  go west on Hwy 62  take Cache exit go south on Hwy 115 until you get to intersection of old Hwy 62  go west about 1 1/4 mi  turn right  on Quannah Rd  go down about 3/4 of mi  house on left or west side of road. ,Comanche,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40031,yes
3310,I went fishing with a friend at Lake Thunderbird about 6 years ago. We started fishing in the afternoon as the day went on we stayed till it got in to the evening. As we were fishing later in the evening me and my friend started hearing strange noise from the other side of Little River which runs in to the lake. It sounded  like a very large man breathing and it was getting closer to us. Then me and my friend started to notice the animals around us were going the other way from the noise. It made me think there is something out there and it coming this way. I started to get very nervous because we could hear branches breaking and it was getting closer to the other side of the river. I became real nervous when my friend said look at all the birds flying the opposite way and in a hurry. Then we heard a loud splash in the water and we figured it was time to go. That something was very upset with our presence in the area. I told all my friends about it they thought I was crazy and to this day I have never been back in the area to fish. I have grown up in the southside of Okc all my life towards the lake and have never heard anything like that before and will never forget the sound it made and the animals running away. ,it is a little river preserve and very wooded on one side of the river. ,Cleveland,7,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40027,no
3311,My cousins and I were spotlighting one night to find coyotes. We were driving alongside a treeline when we spotted eyes shinning in the light about 150 feet away next to the trees. I had binoculars and one of my cousins had a 22. magnum with a scope. We had a very good view of a large biped covered with brown hair  except for white patches on the pecs (chest) and one of its arms. It was about 8   tall or more. It tilted its head down because of the light  but stayed in place for about 5 minutes then stepped across the fence on the treeline and disappeared into the woods. The face was like a man and an ape. ,Northeast of Soper  OK. ,Choctaw,1,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40023,yes

Today was just like every other time they have come out to ride them. We drive our vehicles about 1/8 mile away from the actual park grounds and that  s where the kids and adults ride the 4-wheelers.  We all rode back there for hours... We were making alot of noise of course with 3 children and 4 adults.  Even the owner drove back there in his pickup and stayed awhile... All I am saying is there was alot of noise and I had my Jack Russell Terrier  with me. I came back to the park area along with my husband about 6 30p.m. The kids and their parents continued to stay out there and ride.  I got a call from my son.  He told me that my 7 year old grandson had just encountered some type of large animal.  He said that he wasn  t sure what it was but said it was big and looked sort of like a monkey with long hair all over it and had a bump on it  s head. He said it wasn  t running.  It scared him half to death and he looked behind him at his dad yelled for his help.  My son went on to say that he immediately sped up to where my grandson was and knew immediately something was wrong by the sound of his scream. He immediately got to where my grandson was on the 4-wheeler. He said that it was as if a limb had been pulled way back on a tree and then let go.  It was still moving when he got over there.  His immediate thought was  what is it? First thought was maybe a large dog  but as my grandson began to describe it standing all all fours and yet being as tall as his dad  s chest...dog seemed to be out of the question.   I wondered if there are bears in Oklahoma..  We sort of dismissed it but my grandson kept talking about it. You would just have to know this 7 year old.  He doesn  t lie about anything.  You can pretty much always believe him. He is a really calm  good kid who just loves 4-wheelers more than anything in life.... Anyway  we couldn  t figure out what it was and his parents are trying to convince my grandson that whatever it was is gone now.... my grandson  said   It looked like Harry on Harry and the Hendersons movie but with a bump on it  s head and it wasn  t standing up. He described it as having long hair all over it  s body.  He said it was the color of his hair(blonde) on part of it and dark too. Well  late tonight  my husband called my son and told him that he knew of a man in Davis  Oklahoma that had written a book about bigfoot and swears that they are in Oklahoma... It sounded ridiculous until my daughter-in-law typed into a search engine on the internet tonight.. bigfoot sightings in oklahoma..  She began to read about them and that  s when my grandson said   that  s what I saw except it wasn  t standing up. Now it  s got us wondering if whatever my grandson saw today  actually lives there and is upset that we have disturbed it all. I mean what animal would come that close to all that noise of 4-wheelers and people and cars and a barking Jack Russell dog? It was approx. 7 00pm when this happened today and still light outside. I don  t know what to make of it except my grandson saw something that scared him bad  so much so that he refuses to do his most favorite thing....ride the 4-wheelers at Papa and Nanas. , ,Carter,4,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40019,yes
3313,We were driving north about a mile or two from my moms house in the back roads of Stecker   driving about 40 miles an hour (we were taking my sister back home who lives about 8 miles away)when all of a sudden we saw what looked like a grayish looking football player streak across the road. It was very fast when it ran across the road. I know it wasnt no deer because whatever it was  it was on two legs grayish  and was built like a football player. Meaning it was thick on top like it had shoulder pads on. I never seen an object like that ever. I cant exactly say what I saw but all I know is that I saw somthing weird. If it was a bigfoot  in my opinion from this happening of why they are so hard for people to prove is because they are so incredibelly fast. Maybe thats why their so hard to prove or get a hold of. All I know they are extremly fast. We didnt stop or nothing we were to scared so we just kept driving . We were in a little bity car  a 79 old Datsun  so I know I couldnt run over it or somthing.  , ,Caddo,5,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40015,yes
3314,A friend and I were standing alongside a country road. My friend  s cousin who was with us had walked up the street to a friend  s to get him to join us. We also had several dogs with us in the road. I remember that one or two of the dogs were hunting/tracking dogs. As my friend and I waited in the road we started get the feeling that we were being watched. We noticed a melon patch across the road. We both remarked that it was kind of spooky looking and I made a bet for him to walk across the road and go into the melon patch by himself. He laughed and said forget it. As we stood there I noticed something that seemed to be standing behind a large tree that was by the melon field. I thought it looked like a man as it was standing up erect. I pointed at it to my friend and he saw it also. The dogs we had with us were going crazy by this point. They were barking and running around in the road. Just then I heard what was probably the scariest sound I  ve ever heard and will ever hear in my life. The sound came from the melon field and was enough to make my skin crawl. The sound was a very deep growl. Very similiar to a bear growl only deeper and more focused. I mean that it was a constant low pitched yet resonating growl. It seemed to be a warning growl for us to stay away I guess. As I looked at my friend we both had the look of total fear on our faces. We took off as fast as we could. We totally forgot about my friends cousin who seemed confused when he finally caught up with us. After we told him what we saw and heard he knew what we were talking about since he lived there and was familiar with the stories. We were too scared to walk all the way back to his house so we stopped off at one of their uncle  s house and he took us home by car. He recounted his stories to us  he believed in the thing as well. After the event  we could hear strange sounds coming from the woods for quite a while. They sounded like whistles and howling. After a bit they died off and we finally got to sleep at about 5 or six in the morning. ,Atoka area. The largest river in the area is the boggy river or boggy depot. The animal is called the boggy river or boggy depot monster by people living there. The animal supposedly is seen fairly often along the riverbanks and creeks in the Atoka area. ,Atoka,2,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40005,yes
3315,This sighting happened over 1 year ago. I happened upon your site recently  although I did write to George Noory about the sighting 10 months ago. I am a truck driver. I was headed north on US Route 69. Another truck was passing me and his cab was just about 5 feet from the front of my truck. Off to my right I saw a something running towards the road. The other truck locked up his breakes and I slowed down to keep from hitting it. It took only 2 steps to cross both lanes of the highway  went down the median and crossed the southbound lanes. It ran upright and held its arms to its side as opposed to having its elbows bent like a man would . Its hands where down to its knees. It was covered with dark hair I  d guess about 6 or 7 in long. The  thing  glanced our way as it ran and seem to have dark or black eyes. It was taking long strides and was slightly bent at the waist. The hair on its legs seemed to be longer the the rest of it  s hair. I say hair and fur as it flowed as it ran. It was able to look straight into my cab so I would estimate it was between 7 and 9 ft tall. ,Right before a bridge about 10   south of a sign that reads Clear Boggy Creek  came from a field on the east side to a slight hill and sparce woods on the west side of the highway.

3316,traveling east on hwy I-40 around the town of Hydro Oklahoma  i was a passanger  i saw a large black form come out of a tree line and walk down to the stream squat and scoop water with his hand. you would have to understand the layout of this stream in this part of Oklahoma the soil is red in color  my view was clear and unobstructed. The creature was very large and very black.  The creatue I observed was not as ape like as seen on TV he was not short legged and big bellyed with dangle ape arms.  He was very tall with a longer torso than an ape  the arm were longer than a mans and the body was covered with very thick and black-black hair  i was struck by the ease inwhich he strooled form the treeline the blackness of the creatue and his size.  I don  t even try to make anyone believe my story because I know what I saw! As does any one that has seen it! This not my first report but no one has ever contacted me. ,contact me for further info ,Caddo,5,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40015,yes
3317,We were at my lake house where we were living for the past 3 months. We had returned to get some things that we wanted at our other house so we spent a couple of hours gathering stuff up and cleaning a bit. I went out side looking for the cat then my wife followed. I was in the front yard yelling  tiger   tiger ! My wife went to the back yard and started yelling. Then out of nowhere she hears a hoot owl.  hoo  hoo hoot  it was loud. it sounded close to me and i was in the front yard. but she said it came from not more than 10ft from her. she stoped startled. Then another one went off from the other direction even closer. She comes runnin to the front yard.(we werent more than 15yds. apart to begin with and i kind of met her 3/4 of her way at the front corner of the house) Shes like  Oh my god did you hear that. two owls right there above me . Doesnt sound that creepy butin the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere with no flash light it will startle you. I said  yea i heard it what was it?  she said  they sounded like owls but owls are territorial and are never that close unless they are mating.  Just as she said that every where around us started  hooting  20 to 30 differernt ones. Loud to like stereo turned up all the way in your car loud. And then some of the calls turned in to jungle noises. Like monkeys and tookans all kinds of noises  and in the middle of some of the calls it in a way sounded almost like human laughing but kind of like in an insane way. It just kept getting louder and louder until it was almost ear piercing and then there was complete silence..... The crickets and bugs started back in and i heard a twig  snap! . We hurridly got in the car and put it in reverse. Then peeled out (if you can do that in dirt). On the way down the drive way not more than 20yds from our house. I saw the out line of some thing big and dark colored. But the what I remember the most is the eyes they almost glowed. ,10 miles sw of caddo jake bridge (canadian river)on my land ,Caddo,5,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40015,no
3318,My wife and I were driving through Cogar  Oklahoma in the afternoon on our way to her parents house.  We were about 100 yards from approaching an intersection when I saw a [dark hair-covered  manlike] creature on two legs crossing the intersection we were about to turn on.  It was running fast and it looked like it possibly stepped over a barbwire fence. I also saw something black about 25 feet from the fence as if it had come to a sitting position and i kept my eyes on it and when i got to the intersection i turned to see if it was there but didnt see anything. I dont think what i had my eyes on was what i saw crossing the road but i did see something about 5-6 feet tall cross the intersection fast and step over the fence. My wife did not see it but told me that many sightings have been reported around there and so did her dad when we got there.  There has also been known to be a black panther in that area but this did not look like a panther.  I was really amazed at what i saw that day.  I never thought I  d see something like that. The road we were on had trees to the right and a farm to the left.  When I saw it crossing the road it could have been hiding in tall grass afterwards. ,Go through Union City.  Get on highway 152  drive about 15 minutes until you get to the Cogar  quick stop  and trun left on a road.  Go straight until you get to an intersection.

3319,I saw a Big Foot outside of our bathroom window in Anadarko today 4/26/12 around 12pm. It walked along the tree line and then quickly down into the Washita River. I could only see it from the waist up because of the grass being so tall but it was at least 6 feet tall and around 275 pounds if not more. It was covered in long brownish hair. I only saw the back of it but he said it was NOT a human and was surely a Big Foot. ,Just behind our home in Prairie Village.

3320,I was out with my fraternity camping near the Illinois River. It was around early October. We were in a small clearing near the river under a small hill. There were several of us in the group. Me and two of my friends walked into the treeline under the hill to gather some firewood for the campfire. It was dark and we only had one flashlight. As we gathered wood  up on the side of the hill something started rustling through the trees. The hill was thickly covered in Sumac  which would be very difficult to navigate  especially in the dark. Whatever was on the hill started approaching us  maybe about 100 feet away. It was starting to break some of the branches in the sumac and sounded big! We couldn  t see anything through the dense brush  but whatever it was  was coming towards us. One of my friends picked up a rock and threw it towards whatever was making the noise. It stopped just momentarily and then began running in our direction. At that we all got scared and ran back to the campfire where the rest of the members were. None of the rest of our fraternity members heard anything. We thought they may have been trying to prank us  but all said they  d been right there waiting for us to bring back wood. We all decided to end our outing and got in the vehicle and headed back to the campus. This is about the best I can remember what happened  it  s been many years ago now. ,It was near the Illinois River S.E. of Park Hill. I can  t remember the exact location  but it was within a few hundred feet of the river in a clearing. There was a small hill on the other side which was covered in some trees and thickets of sumac. ,Cherokee,15,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40021,no
3321,In the summer of 2000 I went with my stepfather and his friend to some land (40 acres) that my mother inherited from my grandfather. Itâ€™s in a fairly remote and sparsely populated area near Lake Tenkiller. My grandfather had bought the land because we went to the lake multiple times every year when I was growing up  and fancied building on it. He passed away having never done anything with the land. We were going to clear a â€œroad  from the public road to as far as we could go to the back of the property. That meant clearing brush and cutting trees (with chainsaws). We arrived around 9 00 am and began work. We took a break for lunch and I decided to explore the rest of the property while they sat in the truck and ate. At the back of the property (approximately 150 yds from where we were working)  the land dropped steeply into a canyon/ravine. It was pretty clear all the way to the bottom and probably 80-100 feet of vertical drop. As I neared the bottom I saw what looked like a cave on the opposing side. That side of the canyon was much steeper and nearly solid rock. I walked down to the cave entrance and looked inside. I quickly realized it had another entrance as it was fairly well lit (being noon during the summer). The entrance I was looking into was about 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. I couldn  t see the other entrance from it as the cave made a curve. I went inside and realized something had been living in there. The other entrance was about 30 feet from the first and roughly the same size. In the middle of the cave was a large â€œnest . It consisted of a shredded (filthy) sleeping bag  various pieces of cloth  grasses  and leaves. It was clearly fashioned into a large sort of oval shaped nest about 6 feet across. There was a few pieces of torn up trash scattered around that was mostly food wrappers. My first thought was maybe a homeless person was living there. That would be really weird though because it is miles to any towns or even campgrounds. There are a few nearby  the nearest being about a half mile away. I began to get a very uneasy feeling. I went out the other entrance/exit and decided to go back and tell my stepfather what Iâ€™d found. I was about 25 feet from the cave when I heard a â€œhuff   like an animal snorting. I looked back and up the hillside above the cave probably 30 feet up I saw the head and shoulders of what can only be described as bigfoot. It was looking over the top of one the big rocks covering the hillside. It was covered in reddish/brown hair and didn  t look like a human or an ape  more like a cross between the two. It was looking directly at me and I turned around and ran screaming back up the hill towards my stepfather and his friend. When I got back to them I was out of breath and huffing and puffing and trying to tell them what Iâ€™d seen. They laughed and told me I was full of crap. Despite my frenzied insistence  they didn  t believe me.  They said they thought we  d cleared enough â€œroad  for the day and we  d come back again another day. Well  we never went back. It  s a 2 hr drive from where we live in Norman and my mom decided it wasn  t worth the time and effort. As far as I know  she still owns the land but none of us have been there since. I will never forget that day. No one I know believes me  but I know what I saw. I  ll never go back there without at least a pistol. Whatever that thing was  I got the distinct impression that it didn  t like me being in it  s cave. Visiting Lake Tenkiller many times over the years Iâ€™ve heard and read of many sightings in the area. I always thought they were kinda kooky  probably just people mistaking deer or maybe even a bear for bigfoot. I  ll never doubt them again. I  m 52 years old and I know what I saw that day. At times I  ve tried to tell myself that I was mistaken  but I realize Iâ€™m just trying to make believe it didn  t happen. But it did happen and it  s something I  ll never forget.  ,I would have to get the directions from my mom  as I haven  t driven there and haven  t been back since this incident. ,Cherokee,15,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40021,yes
3322,Various newspaper articles reporting possible bigfoot near Tahlequah  Oklahoma. First report was on August 1  1990 at a mobile home near Eldon  Oklahoma which is east of Tahlequah at the junction of highways 62 and 51. Woman living in the mobile home reported to Cherokee County Sheriff  s Deparment that she heard noises and noticed a bad smell. She then observed a creature approximately 10 feet tall and about 400 pounds. Deputy Joe Weavel investigated the reports and found impressions big enough to place both his feet in. Two days later  an 8 year old girl and her mother described a similar creature going through a trash pile near their house. Their dog chased it but returned with it  s tail between it  s legs. The creature was described as 8 feet tall with dark brown frizzy hair and similar to a bear except that it was described as walking upright. Oklahoma Wildlife Department district chief  Joe Adair said he had received several calls regarding the animal and believed it to be a bear. He said he  nothing to base that on  and that it was unusual for a bear to walk on it  s hind legs for very long. Similar reports came from this area in the early 70  s. ,Highway 51 and 62 junction  Eldon  Oklahoma and 3 miles east. ,Cherokee,15,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40021,yes
3323,My family resides close to Norman  Oklahoma  and from 1976 to the present  there have been numerous incidents revolving around Bigfoot  including two sightings in 1976 and one in January 2003  footprints in both mud and snow  several incidents where vocalization was heard  and numerous other accounts of stones being thrown  foul odor being smelled  fruit being taken off of trees  etc. Back in 1976  Bigfoot researcher Bob Stamps and his partner took several plaster casts of footprints and interviewed family members who had heard and seen the creature. The most recent sighting happened in January of this year. My 61-year old brother-in-law was chopping wood and breaking kindling approximately 40 feet from his house near the edge of the woods. It was early evening and he was just about to finish when he happened to look up and caught the sight of the creature out of the corner of his eye. At that point  the creature was approximately 15-18 feet away from him  standing in enough of a clearing so that he could see him from the waist up (due to thick underbrush he could not see any further down). He estimated the creature to be 7-8 feet tall with a slight hunch.  He froze for a minute and then dropped the wood that was in his hands and ran inside of the house. By the time he entered the house he was visibly shaken and according to my sister  he was  as white as a ghost.  The hair on his arms were standing on end caused by physical reaction of goosebumps due to the state he was in. He was having difficulty breathing and therefore was having a hard time speaking. All he could say was  Buh...buh...buh...  My sister and niece thought he was having a heart attack and were fearing for his life. When he was finally able to calm down  all he could get out was  Bigfoot.  I just saw Bigfoot.  Since my brother-in-law was snapping kindling over his knees  we have come to the conclusion that it was this noise that drew the creature to him. , ,Cleveland,7,Oklahoma ,OK,Winter ,40027,yes
3324,We had lived out here for about 4 years at the time. We were driving down the dirt road and stopped by the apartment style mailboxes about a half mile or so from the house.  While stopped I was talking to my husband and my oldest son started to mumble something but couldn  t quite get it out.  I look back at him and he  s pointing towards the front of the truck.  I look up but don  t see anything at first.  My husband was looking as well but didn  t see anything either. Then I saw it.  I couldn  t speak either.  I started slapping my husbands arm and pointed.  It was across the road on the other side of the creek and up a little ways.  It was on the left side of the fence which is thick brush. On the right was an open pasture which will hold cattle in rotation.  At the time there were cattle in rotation but they were all huddled up across the pasture and right up next to the feed road.  it was very tall...it looked like it could bend over and touch the ground on the right side of the fence without getting hurt by the barbwire.  It stood there and then I think it noticed our truck and looked our way.  It swung an arm out as it turned to look our way.  I got scared and started to drive away.   My son yelled to go back. I had only driven about 15 feet if that and I put the truck in reverse and when I backed it up the thing was gone.  My husband says it has to have been a cow.  I thought for years it had to have been a bear.  But deep down I know that was no bear. When it turned it had a flat face not a bear snout.  It didn  t appear to be scared of us it was more of an uh oh moment.  When it turned towards our truck and saw us it froze.  I didn  t move at all once it saw the truck.  It was gone in seconds.  Its been five years and we still don  t like to run out to the truck after dark.  We are in a secluded area an we all stay to ourselves out here.  we don  t talk about this to anyone and this is the first time we have shared our story.  My whole little family saw this thing.  So we have four people who now believe this thing is real.  Since then we have continued to hear the low growls in the woods.  What sounds like careful steps at night.  I tell myself its a deer or something but I no longer believe its our typical wildlife. ,At this time i don  t want to share this information. It is very close to my home and I am still coming to terms with what we saw. ,Cleveland,7,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40027,yes
3325,Hi  I am from Cache  oklahoma my story takes place in the Wichita mountain just a couple of miles away from my home. About five years ago i was at camp Y  Shua for a church outting and there are mountains that surround the land. My grandma ask me if i want to hike this mountain with her and i said yes well we began to walk up this mountain and i take off from her and go ahead and im rushing up the mountain when i hear someone runing a little ways up from me so i go to see what it is and i see these two tall white creatures and they have hair that covers their bodies and i could even see the dirt stains in their fur they were so tall there faces were covered by the trees. so i ask them who they are and they dont answer so i keep asking questions and they dont respond so i yelled for my grandma and then start to run away until i couldnt see them no more. I told everyone what i saw i thought they were joggers but there is only one way up that mountain no other and i remembered the story my grandma told me bout the mountain next to it. Her brothers and sisters said they seen tall creatures with trees on there head.I believe that there is something in those mountains and it s more than one that have made it their home. ,its by meers ,Comanche,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40031,no
3326,I was at Lake Elmer Thomas Recreational Area Otherwise known as LETRA  on Fort Sill Oklahoma  I had gone down to lake to show my wife where my friend and I used to go fishing. We parked on an inlet of land leading to a small island that could only be crossed through the water. I pointed to the west to give her a kind of an idea of where it was that my friend Lester and I used to drive down to reach a hidden peninsula where the bass were big. When i looked towards the area which is less than maybe half a mile away you could see the area behind our fishing spot which was just a hill in the wilderness. Thats when i saw a LARGE dark figure walking very fast. My estimations from the size of the creature to from where i was standing  it was probably somewhere around 7-8 feet tall. There is nothing but ranges and wilderness in that area.. there is no reason for anyone to be walking alone that far into wilderness of Fort Sill...my wife and I quickly left after what i witnessed.. to this day i still havent gone back to that fishing location in fear of what could possibly be there. ,its on lake elmer thomas recreational area. the lake ON post. not off of it. Theres a road that leads further down the lake that has a small access by gravel/dirt that will lead to the area.. I can show you if possible.. ,Comanche,3,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40031,yes
3327,The incident that I am reporting occurred at Jumper Cemetary  Jay Oklahoma in 1979. Jumper Cemetary is located east of Jay on Hwy 20  then turn on the first dirt road to the right  and follow it to its end approximately 1 mile to the bottom of the hill. One evening in September of 1979  my friend and I were sitting at Jumper Cemetary about dark on a full moonlit night. As we were sitting there  I heard the sound that I thought was a deer walking down the ridge. I told my friend   Listen! There  s a deer coming down the hill.  We sat there and listened as the sound made it  s way down the ridge from town. The west side of the cemetary has trees grown up along the fence row for about half the distance of the west side. A little further down is a platform between two huge oak trees used to place food on when they are having funerals. The sound came to the bottom of the holler on the west side of the cemetary. The cemetary is enclosed by a hog-wire/barbed wire fence about 4 ft tall. Then the sound proceeded to come up the hill between the trees along the fence row and the platform for food. As we listened to this sound come toward us  we were incredulous as we saw a large hairy man looking thing walk up to the fence and step over it. We watched as the animal (it stank tremendously) walked across the cemetary toward a huge tree in the middle. As it came under this tree  its head was just below its lowest branch. Apparently  at this time it became aware of us  as it turned its head and looked over its right shoulder at us. When it saw us  it didn  t run  but it began to walk very fast toward the southern border of the cemetary. When it got there  it  again stepped over the fence. When it got to the timber  it crashed through the trees making a terrible racket. I looked at my friend and asked him if he had saw what I had. He replied that he thought that he had. I had never mentioned this to anyone for fear of being ridiculed  because not only did we see what we took to be a  Bigfoot   but the one that we saw was white. Some ten years later  I was teaching at Kenwood  located in the extreme western portion of central Delaware County. We were watching a video called  Legends of the Ozarks . This video recreated a scene that supposedly happened near Fayetteville  Arkansas. This recreation showed exactly what my friend and I had seen. Thereafter  I spoke about this incident to some of my elderly friends and relatives who have lived in the area all of their lives. Some of them also admitted to having seen this beast at some point in the past  but like me had never said anything due to the fear of being ridiculed. I know what I saw; it doesn  t matter if I am believed or not. I myself was incredulous at the time. My mind had a hard time accepting what my eyes were seeing. I can see this in my mind today  just as if it had happened moments ago. ,This incident occurred at Jumper Cemetary  Hwy 20 east  turn right and cross the cattleguard and proceed to the cemetary at the bottom of the hill; approximately 1 mile. I repeat though  that this animal had come from the direction of town and must have been  from first hearing the sound  just outside of town. I have often wondered if it were going through people  s garbage looking for food. ,Delaware,8,Oklahoma ,OK,Fall ,40041,yes
3328,(This is what took place in the spring of 2000 to my husband and two of his friends. He related this story to me last year after returning from a camping trip to Jay OK. This is the first time I have seen him come back frightened from a fishing trip. After accidently discovering your web sight  I was amazed to find out that there had been sightings in the past in the Jay area and felt that their experience could be important because of previous sightings in the Jay area.) April of 2000  myself and two friends went to an area apx 12 miles west of Jay Ok to do some  gigging . We set up camp and went out on the boat until about 10pm that night. We came back to camp  cooked and ate supper  and retired for the night in one large tent. About ten minutes after settling in  there were very loud  deep throated   banchee  screams coming from across the creek  which echoed throughout the area. All three of us have hunted and fished all our lives  one of us grew up in Jay  yet none of us had ever heard that sound before. It was extremely frightning to put it mildly. The screaming went on for around 30 minutes  and whatever was screaming seemed to be moving up and down the opposite side of the creek-or there was more than one animal screaming. There was no doubt that the sound was coming from a LARGE animal of some kind. Nobody said a word to each other as the screaming went on. Each scream lasted about 3-4 seconds. Everyone admitted that the screams where totally unknown to them and that it was a very frightening experience. We went gigging the next day also. We retired around the same time  12pm that night. Again the screaming started  but this time it was coming from behind our tent in a wooded area in front of a bluff. The screaming seemed louder because it was apx. 300 feet away. Again we lay very still  feeling it would be safer to stay in the tent instead of trying to get to the truck. It again lasted around 30 minutes and then fell silent. We left the next day. We just returned from another camping trip to the same area  April 2001. There was no screaming  just alot of thrashing in the brush across the creek  made by something that seemed to be large. We felt pretty uncomfortable as the creek was shallow  around 4 feet  and there was a feeling that whatever was thrashing the brush  could easily come after us in the boat. There were no visual sightings  only the screams in 2000 and the thrashing brush in 2001. If we make the trip next year  I will be bringing a tape recorder. ,Creek between Spavinaw and Eucha on land owned by the city of Tulsa Oklahoma. ,Delaware,8,Oklahoma ,OK,Spring ,40041,no
3329,Video report filmed by Ron Boles and Larry Newman This report was first made known to Larry Newman and I by this man  s daughter. Larry and I went to the residence of the witness which is also the location of the sighting. The witness is a Cherokee Native American elder of this area. He witnessed on a clear summer  s day from his front porch  in a field across an old dirt road  a deer running at a very fast pace  with a large grey seemingly bipedal creature in pursuit. The creature was chasing using both arm and legs in a loping movement. Both animals went out of sight but then the witness heard the deer bleating and then a  Thump . Then it was quiet. , ,Delaware,8,Oklahoma ,OK,Summer ,40041,yes
3760,My brother and I were out riding our mini bike one afternoon after school approximately 4 00 to 5 00 P.M.. It was the beginning of Spring and we were searching for bait to go fishing.  We parked our bike on the road  which at the time was gravel and traveled very little. We walked down a path that was used by a farmer to get to his pasture were he had cattle grazing. As we walked down the path I felt as though we were being watched. It was an eerie feeling that still haunts me to this day as I recall the incident. Off to my left and approximately 30 to 40 yards away  and 50 or so yards from the main road  was a hairy creature standing in a bent over slump raking it  s arms through a patch of May apple. My brother saw it at about the same time. At that moment the two of us ran as fast as we could not looking at each other  but looking at the creature over our shoulders. I was afraid that it would come after us  but it stood in the patch of May apple looking at us as though it didn  t know what to make of us. I have told this story many times since that day. Many people laugh in disbelief  but I know what I saw and it could only be one of two things. Either someone dressed in a Bigfoot costume  or it was Bigfoot himself. ,Sighting occurred in the state of Tennessee  Williamson County  South Lick Creek Road.

3761,When I was a boy  about 10 years ago  I was walking in the snow one morning on my Grandmother  s farm.  I came across some footprints in the snow that would be appoximately the size and shape of an adult human  s foot  but with one exception.  Both feet had only four toes. The area is rural  but is populated and this particular area is in an open field that is in plain view of a well-traveled road.  Similar tracks appeared in the snow the following year.  Unfortunately I was too young to drive to the store for film and no one else in my family seemed to care about my findings.  Several years later  approximately 1993-1994  I had another strange experience on our small farm.  I never connected the two events until reading some other stories on your web-site.  One night I stepped out of our house into the car-port.  The car-port was brightly illuminated  but none of the other exterior lights were on.  This made it impossible to see outides the perimiter of the car-port.  As I stepped out of the house  something screamed at me from the darkness  a screma like I had never heard.  It was not human  it was too wild  but it sounded more human than animal.  It seemed to be both a warning and a scream of terror.  I was told that it was probably a wildcat  but never believed it to sound like a cat at all.  I wasn  t aware that screaming was associated with bigfoot.  I am now wondering if the number of toes I mentioned earlier is in order? ,The area is near I-40 and the Lebanon Municipal Airport.

3763,Yesterday I  my dad my son and his Friend  went up to our farm in Wilson County to do some bush hogging and prepare our deer stands for the up coming season..The kids asked if they could walk the logging road to see if they could see any deer or turkeys while me and my dad bush hogged the fields. About 20 minutes went by and I see my son and his friend running towards the tractor out of breath.. Dad i don  t care if you believe me or not but what we just saw...I never want to see again! ..His friend said she saw it first. This is the story they have repeatedly told me all afternoon yesterday and this morning- They were walking the logging Rd and my son started hearing these loud crashes in front of them to the right coming towards them He said he stopped and felt  Very uneasy  about going any further to which he told his friend  he wasn  t going any farther and she could if she wanted ..She walked around the bend of the road come walking fast back to him  and says  There was this thing looking at me behind a tree swaying left to right as if to see what she was..It leaned as if to be curious..So  She not wanting to show it any harm by running or sudden  movement afraid it would chase her just turned and walked fast back to my son and told him  There is something huge and black standing around the corner ...My son started walking with her and turned back to see if he could see anything and it had came around the corner and was staring at them..He said it was between 7-8ft tall had blackish/brown almost like a turkeys feather color when the sun is not shining on its feathers  and had HUGE muscles showing through the fur he especially notice how broad the shoulders were and how muscular the arms were.At that time they started running as fast as they could until they got to the field i was cutting.. I eventually got in my truck and drove to the spot/area they said this all happened..The woods were a  dead quiet ..No Tracks were found i did not smell any foul odor as i have heard this animal has  plus a storm was approaching so i had to get back and put the tractor up. My son who is sitting beside me as i type this says  I just don  t feel it meant any harm it was puzzled as why we were there.  There were men cutting hay on the next farm over which had not been done in quite a while.There is no hunting no more cattle that place is not disturbed at all so maybe it came from there?? What makes me believe even more is that my son LOVES hunting and that farm but now says he is not coming up unless he has protection(Gun)and will not walk the place alone.Whatever this was or whatever happened to them has changed them.The friend which said she doesn  t believe in Bigfoot now is a firm believer. My son  s words- It wasn  t scared of us but we sure were of it!  ,Rural Wilson County Tennessee ,Wilson,4,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47189,yes

3765,Observed a giant bi-pedal creature in the Cherokee National Forest in Unicoi County Tennessee near the North Carolina border. Creature was in the creek when I first saw it. The creature immediately sensed my presence and came out of the creek and placed its hand on a tree and hit the tree in a knocking manner approximately 4 times. I was trying to get my phone out and attempt to take a picture when the creature stomped the ground with its foot and growled something incredibly fierce several times. A growl I can best describe as a mix between a bear and a large canine. After the growl I started to retreat and as I did the creature took off in a run and vanished. I was in the very close range of 15 to 20 yards when I observed it. If there had not been running water I don  t believe I would have gotten that close to it as it masked it hearing me and me hearing it. The time of day was 7 am and I was in the woods going to go trout fishing. I watched the creature for around 45 seconds and height estimate is at least 8feet and shoulder to shoulder 3 feet at least. The creature had brown and red hair that was very thick  yet had a shine in the coat  a flat face and a distinct  almost white nose that looked very wide and brown eyes. I am very fortunate to see what I saw and all the details of the creature as I was very close to it I am a believer in sasquatches and just feel so fortunate to have this experience. I didn  t feel threatened by the creature just in awe of its massive size and agility as it lept out of the creek and how quickly it ran out of sight. ,Near north Indian Creek Campground on Hwy 107 North  halfway between the town of Erwin TN and Buladean NC on the Unaka mountain range as part of the Cherokee National Forest. ,Unicoi,1,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47171,yes

We were sitting in a field  about an acre. this thing came up and it sounded like it started to belly ache  I figured  because we were in the field.

We never saw it  it wouldn  t step out into the light  but it cried about 12 to 15 times  when it stoped I really worried where it was and what it was!

3767,In late spring of 1970 while traveling south between Gatlinburg  Tn and Cherokee  N.C. on Hiway 441 somewhere near the state line in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. We sighted a very tall hairy creature. We were crusing down the road wondering if we would see any bear and as we rounded a curve there was this creature coming from the right side of the road down grade from some small trees and bushes that still had leaves. It moved across the road directly in front of us and after entering the bushes on the left side of the road angled off the same direction we were traveling. We could still see it  s head for a few seconds before it dissapeared. I would guess the height to be somewhere in the 7+ foot tall range. It had a very long stride and walked like a human swinging it  s long arms with it  s stride. It covered the distance of 100 ft or so in seconds. It never looked at us  there were no noticable features that stood out. It was tall  slender  smooth clean straight hair that coved the whole body and it  s head just seemed to come out of the body with no noticable neck. We were flabergasted at the sight of it and tried to convince ourselves it was a bear. But we knew it could not be because of the way it walked and it  s height  no nose protruded nor could we see any facial features as it never even looked at us nor showed any sighns of us being there. We were crusing along probably around 45 MPH with almost no other traffic on the road that day. It happened so quickly that my wife never had time to pick up the camera in her lap and get a picture. ,From Gatlinburg take Hwy 441(Newfound Gap Rd) towards Cherokee NC.Just past the park entrance sign is where the sighting occurred. ,Sevier,10,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47155,yes
3768,I  ll start off by saying I have recently learned of some characteristics of the bigfoot aka tree knocks rock throwing  howls ect.. I have this going on at my home as of just a few nights ago over a two hour period. I live in east TN and my first sighting was in a night in 1978 on Hwy 92 in southeast KY as I watched a brownish colored creature standing by the road as we were headed home from a trip. It stood there just for a few seconds before turning back into the woods and was gone which left a lasting picture burned into my memory as I was only 8 years old.  My second sighting was in 1986 just south of Oneida TN in the wood line by our driveway behind the Church near my home. I can show the exact place where I stopped as a teenager to adjust the radio when a clod of gravel and dirt hit the hood of my car  I looked up to see what I thought to be someone standing on the berm of the road as it lead on to my home maybe 400 yards on passed the creature. The road lead through a small patch of woods in an S curve. Late in the evening with the shadows made it hard to see who or what it was I was just mad because a teenagers car is his pride and joy  so I took off towards it on the road but as I got closer to it I began to see  something  different began to take shape in the shadows that thing was way taller than anyone I  ve ever met and covered in matted hair I had to drive right by it and I was scared to death. The setting sun gave it a reddish brownish look so like any scared kid I floored it and got on to the house. I told my mom who was standing out in the yard about it and showed her the gravel and dirt still on my hood and she said our dogs had been barking and looking over that way but they wouldn  t leave the yard. The next day we went back over that way to look around and we found where the dirt and gravel had been picked up in chunks from the berm. I began to look at the distance between where I was sitting in the car and where it was standing.  This thing had a quarterbacks arm to throw that far. I  d say 60+ yards you can measure the distance for yourself I  ll gladly show you where this happened. As I said earlier some strange stuff has been going on around my home which is situated between Brewster Mountain and Bear Creek west of Oneida TN here lately. I  ll be glad to speak with y  all as I know I  ve probably left out some details. ,along the wood line behind the High point Baptist Church as it goes south through the woods towards Landmark Baptist Church  it was before the 911 address system so the road didn  t have a name. ,Scott,8,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47151,yes

3770,My brother and I were on our family farm playing in the woods as usual.  We were in a heavily wooded area with thick underbrush in a valley behind our tobacco barn playing in the stream that ran along one side of the barn.  We were collecting rocks and making a dam for a swimming hole for the next summer  s use.  It was late in the afternoon- almost dusk.  I kept having one of those  gut feelings  that something wasn  t  right  but I couldn  t put my finger on it  so we kept working. I had mentioned my feeling to my brother.  I crossed the stream with a jump holding a large field rock and heard a stick break loudly.  I looked under my feet and there was nothing but leaves and mud  I looked back across the stream at my brother who wasn  t near any dead fall.  I also had a severe wake up call in my gut to get out of there.  I placed my rock and told my brother we had to get out of there immediately  something wasn  t right.  He didn  t protest as his hackles were also raised by that time. I retrieved my rifle from the tree across the creek where we  d left our  weapons  (pump BB air rifles  we didn  t get shotguns till the next Christmas) and walked to the 4 foot woven wire fence we had to cross.  I set my BB gun down on the other side of the fence and grabbed some low hanging tree limbs to assist my getting across the fence.  Once I dropped down on the other side I turned toward the barn to pick up my BB gun.  I came eye to eye with a... thing.  A huge black  hairy thing crouched down slightly behind an old tree.  It had huge black eyes and needless to say scared the beegeesus out of me.  I screamed my brother  s name at the top of my lungs and started pumping my BB gun for all it was worth  I intended to shoot it in the eyes if it moved.  My brother was about 15 yards from me on the other side of the fence retrieving his BB gun.  My next thought was run for help so I took off for the clearing some 50 yards away.  My brother says he looked at me after I screamed (a bloodcurdling scream he says) and says I was literally as white as a sheet and thought  what the hell  s wrong with her?   He then fired his BB air gun because it was a long pistol type model that he stuck through his belt.  Then he said he looked up across the creek and saw the thing- only it was out from behind the tree  standing fully erect now.  My brother cleared a 4 foot fence in one bound with 2 pair of long underwear and a pair of jeans on and he wasn  t much taller than the fence at the time.  Meanwhile I  d made it to the clearing and turned toward the woods with my gun ready  looking for any sign of my brother.  I was never so glad in my life to see a hunter  s orange sock cap bobbing my way.  I was crying and screaming for him hysterically.  He ran up to me and said he  d heard it chasing him  but it didn  t follow him out of the woods  yet anyway.  We ran the whole rest of the way back to the farm house which was about 1/4 mile across a main road.  When we reached the house and  fell in the door  as my aunt says  we told her and my cousin about our encounter.  They laughed it off nervously and my aunt then confessed to many sightings and strange occurrences through the years in the area.  She told us a man had disappeared off a bridge on a tractor just below (less than 500 yards downstream) where we  d been when she was a child.  Said the tractor was found overturned in the creek  but the man never was. ,Robertson County  Springfield  TN; New Cut Road near Old New Cut Road ,Robertson,1,Tennessee ,TN,Winter ,47147,yes
3771,My 9 yr old son & I were traveling on TN Rd 61 in Roane County outside of Harriman TN  at about 345pm on Tuesday  June 19  2012 when about 10 -12 car lengths in front of us a Large Black Hairy upright Person? Bigfoot  crossed the 2 lane road. It came out of the forest on the other side of the road & crossed in about 3 steps before looking over at us then entering the brush before the forest. Looked as thou it was 8ft tall or larger. I was able to go back today 6-26-2012  to look at the site where very large foot markings marked in the grass & a large bedded down grass area that looked very fresh. As we drove by on the 19th we looked more into the forest to see him  but saw nothing. I feel today after reseeing the spot where it crossed the road & we being very close laid down low in the grass & shrubs till we passed by.

3772,This particular incident happened to me about 3 years ago. An event that I had kept to myself for at least a year before I even told any of my closest friends about. Like the majority of people who have an experience like this  the fear of being ridiculed and labeled  nuts  has kept me quiet. Stumbling upon your website and reading other reports prompted me to give my account. Being from the South I have always been active outdoors; fishing  hunting camping and spelunking. I was on a solo camping trip on the Cumberland Plateau. It was early morning  very dark and my campfire had long been extinguished and my propane lantern was spent. I was asleep in my 2 man tent when I suddenly awoke to the feeling that someone was approaching me. I had strategically set my tent up so that I could see the end of the 40 yard  steep incline that led to my campsite. Sitting up I saw the silouette of a humanoid figure at the top of the trail.(The closet comparison I can make would be similar to the alien in Predator.) I strained hard to make sure I was relly seeing what my eyes were telling me I was seeing. The figure had apparently stumbled upon me by chance and stopped. As I was looking  I first noticed the height to be 6 1/2 to 7 foot tall  bi-pedal and shoulders that were the widest I had ever seen. It was then that I saw a second figure of equal proportions directly behind the first. At this point  the second figure moved left as if to outflank my tent. That is when the sudden rush for urgency swept over me. I quickly started feeling around for the .44 Magnum and flashlight that I had in the tent with me. What seemed like forever but only took 3-5 seconds  I located both and shined/aimed it in the direction of the trail and it was gone. I stayed in the tent and replayed the events that just happened over and over becoming more and more convinced that what I saw were actually 2 Bigfoot creatures. The size  stealth and intelligence of these creatures was humbling. There are black bear that inhabit the woods also  but being familiar with the species and the fact that the two figures stood bi-pedally still and silent for an extended period of time and the intelligence to outflank me solidifies my belief in this encounter. I eventually went back to sleep with the thought that I was no longer in danger and that I had probably startled them as much as they did me. I left the area that morning knowing I had experienced something unlike any other experience in the wild that I had ever had. ,Off of Hwy 27 North  turn left into the Laurel-Snow Wilderness Pocket. ,Rhea,1,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47143,yes
3773,I saw what I thought was a bear. Alongside a creek bed at the bottom of a mountain off state forest road 77 in the Cherokee National Forest. About 10 miles down a gravel road past the Chilhowee Campground I stopped to take a break. I smelled a strong musty urine scent. Then I heard a low deep slow grunt not 25 ft. from me. I looked in the direction of the noise and standing behind some underbrush at the creek  I saw a large black and gray thing standing looking right at me! It  s not no bear I thought immediatly. It had a rather large roundish head with a lot of gray on it with a very noticable eyebrow and mustache accent. It  s nose was large and mostly flat and blackish in color as well as it  s lower lip. I remember it having a large square shaped lower jaw. I was very upset as my heart was pounding like a drum as I worked my way back to my car door  it just stared at me. It  s eyes I recall is what scared me the most. They were large also and had a bright brown appearance and I never took my eyes off him. I saw how really big this thing was when it turned and disappeared into the thick brush. It  s shoulders were massive with a very short neck and more gray hair than black hair on his back that seemed to be about 2-3 in. in length. The whole sighting only lasted for 1-2 minutes and I  m glad  but for me I  m in the know. I know something is out there that only another eyewitness could understand. Only bigfoot or whatever you call him will let you get a glimpse  you just have to be ready! ,Hwy 64 in Ocoee  TN then take forest road 77 up to Chilhowee campground but do not enter campground stay straight along gravel road toward Greasy Creek N.C.

3774,I am an avid outdoors man  I canoe and camp on a regular basis  mostly by myself (nobody spends any time in the wild anymore). On my most recent canoe/camping trip I had set up camp started a fire  and and had just finished my dinner at around 9p.m. I had put my drinks in the water on the edge of the river and was walking down to the edge of the river to grab on  when in about ten yards of the edge I heard a big splash  something being thrown or dropped in the water  I didn  t pay any attention so I kept walking  then as I approached the edge another even bigger splash was made and I could see the large rock that made it fly through the air hitting about ten yards from where I was. I froze and all the hair on my body stood straight up. I shined my led light over to the area and saw a set of eyes for about two seconds before they vanished. I fired my pistol to scare off anyone I thought would be messing with me  but no response  and this was on a week night where the possibility of someone roaming the area was not likely. I quickly packed my gear and left for home. The next morning I came back to the sight to look around and I heard something rustling in the brush  then I heard knocks in a steady patten of three I grabbed a piece of drift wood and knocked back. This continued for around five minutes  until I heard a car coming so I stopped because I didn  t want to give any curiosity to anyone  and I didn  t want anyone to think I was crazy. I left came back four days later and spotted a track. The track was around four-five inches longer than my shoed foot  which is a size twelve. , ,Perry,12,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47135,yes
3775,Well this is going to sound strange but  here it goes. I grew up in a small community were something else lived. I have talked to people from that area from three generations that have seen this thing. If you have never seen it most of the people that have won  t tell you much  they do not want anybody to think they are crazy!! I even knew one man who  is dead now that had a relationship (fed it and it was not afraid of him)it. Any way I seen it 3 times during my childhood 1 time from about 200 yards with 2 other people. The other 2 times I was alone. One of those times I was maybe 40 yards away coming home and it was in my back yard by a fence. But the last time was very intence  I was walking home from town (about 3 miles away)and it was pretty dark so I was looking down most of the time. I was about a quarter of a mile from home and I turned onto the street that led to my house. I walked about 30 feet and there it was. It was about 10 feet in front of me. It was down on it  s hands and feet doing something! It saw me at the same time I saw it  it stood up and we looked at each other for a few seconds (it seemed like forever) then it ran one way and I ran the other way. Now we always called it the White Thing. It looked like what most people think a big foot looks like except it is an off white color  it is about 8-9 feet tall. My father always said all of us kids were  seeing things  untill he found tracks while hunting. I know 30-40 people who have seen this thing. ,Off of Interstate 155 at the Obion exit  turn west (away from town) go about 2 miles and Glass is the first Community you come to.

3776,I was sitting at camp and could smell the familiar smell of a bear so I started looking around the area.  I saw something move and at first I thought it was a man.  Then it stood up as if it had been eating something on the ground.  It paused then proceeded to walk calmley across the top of this ridge steadily becoming more clear to my sight. It came close enough that I could hear the twigs breaking under foot.  After it traveled aprox. 80-100 feet it the went down the backside of the ridge.  And NO it wasnt a bear!  It was much bigger.  Color was dark - almost black. , ,Polk,36,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47139,yes
3777,I was coming home from work one night in the summer of 1988 or 1989.  It was about 8 50 PM  dark and there was a heavy fog on the ground.   I had my low-beams on be better see through this ground fog which was about 1 to 2   deep in most places.  This area around Percy Priest lake was sparsely populated at that time.  There were no homes and no street lights.  It  s 6 miles from the nearest town.  My place was one of a few homes along this stretch of road. As I turned down my road  going around 35 mph in this fog I saw something move on the right hand side of the road  about (I  m guessing here) 150   from my driveway  which was on the left.  The area this movement was seen was by a fresh clearing in the woods where a new home was to be built later that year.  Having seen deer cross this road at night I thought it was a deer about to cross so slowed down and prepared to stop.  When I was perhaps (guessing again)  100   to 125    from it I hit the brakes hard - terrified to see a Bigfoot / Sasquatch stepping out onto the road. He (?) looked towards my car for no more than a few seconds  then proceeded across the road at a walk.  He went down the slight embankment where there were felled trees  rock rubble and other things on the ground from the construction crew.  This lot on the left hand side and was in the process of being cleared for another home. It adjoined my property.  I watched  in utter shock  hands shaking and unable to move as he simply vanished into the fog and darkness.  He had to be able to see in the dark to negotiate that partly cleared lot.  He never looked back.  He made no threatening moves.  I got the impression he just wanted to go his way and be left alone. I sat there for some time before the shaking stopped enough for me to drive.  No other cars passed.  When I was calm enough I drove down my driveway and parked there  window open a bit to listen.  It was silent except for the usual crickets.   I saw nothing moving around my home.  The outside light was on and my two dogs  as usual  suddenly appeared out of the darkness to greet me.  I got the car as close to the front porch as I could  got my key ready and ran up the steps as quickly as I could to get inside.  Once inside I closed and locked every window  bolted the door and waited for my room mate to get home.  Although this creature was not at all threatening I couldn  t shake the fear that it would come looking for me.  I had never heard of one of these animals harming anyone but the fear lingered.  It was a truly terrifying experience.  For weeks I couldn  t sleep at night.  I would fall asleep at dawn and wake up in time to go to work. His description   This creature was no more than about 6   tall  fully covered with a reddish brown fur (hair?) including it  s face.  It was not built like the Sasquatch pictures I have always seen on TV or in the papers.  It was more slender and manlike  not apish at all.  From that distance I couldn  t see it  s facial features except to see the face was covered in fur.  Since there were no prominent breasts and the genital area was covered with long hair  I  m assuming it was a male. I still live in the same place and have never seen this creature again.  The area is much more built up now so they may have moved on to a less populated area around the lake. , ,Rutherford,4,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47149,yes
3778,Upon my initial encounter  I did not think at all that I would be attributing it to something like this. However  the more I read  the more certain I am that me and my friends had a close encounter with a bigfoot. It was early spring when me and two buddies decided to romp through the woods behind my dad  s house. It was just before dusk and there was an hour or so left of daylight. We headed out equipped with only two flashlights and cigarettes. My friends were Robert (a tall well built guy and Paul  another large guy but not as tall as Robert). Neither of them had any beliefs in anything other than the normal mundane. I on the other hand have always had an open mind on topics such as these. We were prompted to venture out based on some local tales of the woods that grew up to my dad  s back yard and that encompassed many miles of land along the Stones River in TN. The stories were mostly odd noises (growling  knocking sounds  and screams). The occasional sighting of something strange (figures moving through the woods etc). We always thought it to be ghosts as battles of the Civil War were fought in the area. Anyway  we set out to explore the woods and the horse trail that followed the river several hundred yards behind the house. As we reached the trail I noticed oddly that there seemed to be quite a few trees that had been pushed over and uprooted. I commented on this to them and they didn  t seem to think much of it. We continued on and at a fork in the trail we opted for the higher ground as the alternative path was somewhat muddy. This lead us to a ravine that the trail sharply bypasses. On a whim I offered up the idea that we should get off the trail and hike out this ravine to see where it would lead. They both pondered for a moment and off we went. Perhaps an hour or two went by with us all having a great time laughing and conversing when we came upon a spot of ground that was covered with dried grass and chose to take a break. At this point it was well past dark. We shut off our lights and Robert and Paul lit up their cigarretes. I remember looking up while they smoked and seeing stars but no moon. It was crystal clear and I commented on how dark it was. A few moments passed and Robert then seemed to become uneasy and stated that he was ready to head back. Paul and myself seemed a little thrown off by this as we have never seen Robert become so unnerved so quickly. We readily agreed to leave and rose from our spot on the ground and realized that where we were sitting was just 5   from the trail. We climbed the steep embankment and resumed our walk on the trail. The trail follows the river and if you walk far enough it meets the road and curves sharply back into the woods and continues on with the river for many miles. I have never (especially after that night) walked it  s entire length. In fact  I can  t recall anyone I know that has. Regardless as we started walking I did get the sensation that we were being watched. I think we all 3 had this feeling as our conversation and laughter didn  t ever quite resume. We had walked about 15-20 yards perhaps after climbing back onto the trail (which at this point had no trees overhead just on each side of us) and then the trail entered into the woods again. The forest here was extremely thick overhead and it was very dark at this point. We continued on with the intentions of getting to the road as mentioned before. We were perhaps 100 yards from the road when we heard the first branch break. If you asked me today I would tell you that Paul was a little crazy as he darted into the woods in the direction of the noise. He had no flashlight as Robert and myself had the only 2. At this moment I have never seen someone so afraid as Robert was at that moment. He was more than willing to leave our idiot friend and bolt for the road. After some convincing  we headed toward the location Paul had run. We used our flashlights sparingly as we had assumed by now that someone was out there with us. We did not want out lights to give away our location. I remember nearing the point where Paul vanished and calling his name in a half yell/whisper. His reponse still gives me chills. He half pleading asked me to be quiet. Then I heard him making his way toward us. When he entered onto the trail from the trees on our right side I could see his face (barely but enough) was filled with fear. He told us that someone was out here and that now he too was more than ready to leave. We quickly stood up and turned to make our way to the nearest exit... to the road when we heard again another branch break. This was in the direction we were wanting to go. Not what we wanted to hear. At this point  I feel it  s necessary to point out that when I say branches breaking I don  t mean little twigs. It was loud enough to sound like someone snapping a rather large branch on their knee. To me it meant something big. With no option to leave quickly we opted to head back the way we had come. I would guess that we had walked maybe 2-3 miles away from my home. None of us looked forward to this prospect  least of all Robert. At a brisk pace we began the hike back with our lights on. This is where the story begins to blur and again I get chills thinking about it. Whatever it was had to be following us for from time to time  we would hear the same branch breaking. Each time we did  we would crouch down and huddle together with our lights off. Then  when all seemed well  we would trek off again lights blazing. I would say this pattern repeated perhaps 5-6 times. The last time we huddled is the last moment of clarity I have. We were at the base of a fairly steep incline on the trail. Along the river this was an area we called the bluffs as there are a series of steep cliffs here. We cut off ourlights again in response to the same noises. We had not huddled for more than 30 seconds when the air was filled with the most horrific scream I have ever heard in my life. The intensity was such that it echoed far down the river and I would have to say for several miles. Without hesitation I ran. I know they did too as I could hear Robert and Paul behind me. We did not stop and did not turn off our lights till we reached the house. Fully out of breath  we all three collapsed in the living room. We were all in disbelief unsure as to what had just happened. I heard my dog begin to bark and assumed that she was barking at us returning home. She was kept in a fenced in area out back. Paul took a light and shone it into the yard and quickly noted that she was barking into the woods. When he closed the back door  we heard the scream again. It had followed us for the most part but remained in the woods. Having enough  we left. I spent the night at their house not eager to remain home. There are several other things I would like to report that have only now dawned on me that relate to this experience and this topic. Also  I would love the chance to have someone with knowledge accompany me to the area as I do not think this was an isolated encounter.

3779,The reason I never told anyone was because I found it hard to believe myself  much less what other people would say or think about me. I recently began working at an ARMY hospital and befriended someone who had a very near experience with what was considered a juvenile Sasquatch. After 17 years that night is still very vivid and etched in my mind. With the help of Google earth maps I was able to find the exact spot that I had my encounter back in December 17  1997. It was just as I had remembered and as I had described to my friend. The first time I saw it  again after all these years  the hair on my arms and neck stood on end and a cold chill ran through me. Amazing! After 17 years and never having told anyone I experienced that night over. It was December 17  1997 my friend had wanted to take me to this spot that she said looked spectacular under a full moon. We reached the spot that had a clearing of deforested area to the right with a 45 degree grade. The road was cut against the mountain edge and it was a spectacular view with a fresh coating of snow that had fallen. The section of the road had a landing cut at the end of the curve and we had backed up into the landing where we could see any oncoming traffic. We had been there approximately an hour and the cab in my truck had gotten a little too cold so I turned on the truck and put the heater vent on. My friend had noticed something in the road when the windshield defrosted  we were staring at a full grown male boar that was rooting through the snow on the edge of the road. This thing was huge and it made me regret not having my rifle or bow with me. It was one of those chance of a lifetimes seeing something like that just 60 to 70 yards away. We were downwind from him and we must have watched that boar root for about 10 minutes when all of a sudden it sniffed the air and was gone. It ran like it feared for its life across the road and up the left side of the mountain that had the same 45 degree grade going uphill. My friend and I both wondered what wouldâ€™ve made it run like that. I turned the truck off and we listened for any kind of noise that could have spooked him. We both talked about what wouldâ€™ve made it run away like that. She joked that it was probably a black bear since they were common sightings out there. Maybe 5 minutes had passed when she peered out the windshield and pointed to the tree line and told me to look. She and I both thought it was a black bear and with the tree line in the background it was really hard to make out the shape. It wasnâ€™t until it was approximately at the same spot the boar was and it was standing upright that I had to really strain to see what I thought I was seeing. We were still downwind from the spot where it was standing and had not noticed us yet. It was standing upright but it seemed it was looking at the ground as if tracking the boar. I watched it for a good 5 minutes and I tried to tell myself that everything in my mind was negating that it was not a black bear. First black bears do not stand and rear up unless provoked or if they need the height to look at something in the distance. Second  if it does stand up it does not walk a good 20 to 25 yards on two legs like this form did coming out of the tree line up a 45 degree slope. Third  when bears rear up on their hind legs their front arms and feet come towards the center of their mass and this form had long arms that swung at its side. As it stood over the spot where the boar had been rooting I was staring in disbelief. Mind you  my friend and I had not been drinking and neither one of us smokes  so there was nothing in our systems that could have created this image. There was a complete full moon but it was behind the form so all I could really see was the outline of it and I strained to see its face and form a little better.  I reached to the left side of my dash and pulled on the light knob and then the high beams. There stood a figure approximately 8 to 8.5 feet tall. I could see the steam of its breath as it folded its left arm over its face and blocked my high beam light from its face. It stood there frozen as if he were trying to figure out what was causing this light. It looked puzzled and tried to see between its fingers at my truck but the lights must have really blinded it because it kept dodging its head back and forth to get a better look at us. We were at a stale mate; I was in disbelief at what I knew I was looking at and it was in disbelief at these two lights that were peering at him from the darkness. He tried to move to the side and the lights still bothered him because in an instant his face went from puzzlement to one of anger. I remember seeing his eyes. His eyes were this glowing amber red color and his brow was frowned which only intensified more the longer the lights shined upon him. He grunted and the steam from his mouth was a great billow of smoke caused from his hot breath hitting the cold midnight air. It looked like he was going to take steps toward the truck and I laid in on the horn. I remember his body shuddering at the noise and he turned towards the same general area the boar had run up. It took three strides for him to cover approximately 20 feet of road way and he reached up for the base of a small sapling grabbed it and propelled himself up the mountain and in a matter of 2 seconds he was gone from sight.  I sat there almost in disbelief looking up the side of the mountain where he vanished. My heart was beating fast and I had these cold chills that scared me to the core. At this time I looked over at my friend and asked if she had just seen that. Her eyes were big as saucers  her mouth was open and shaking  and couldnâ€™t make a noise. I reached over and touched her arm and she pulled it back hard. It was at this moment that I realized she had urinated in her jeans and she was afraid. Now let me tell you this girl was a mountain girl. Been hunting and fishing with her daddy since she was a little girl. She knew firearms  she knew how to hunt and fish and could hang with the best of them. She knew how to skin a dear  baited her own hooks  and cleaned her own fish. She knew how to rough it out in the wild and had been on hundreds of hunting and camping trips. This was by no means a girl that would scare easily. EVER! She never even looked at me she just screamed to get out of there and take her home. I tried reaching out to her and she pulled away. I knew her enough to know not to try further and I started the truck up. When the heater started up there was a stench that filled the truck cab. Something like strong urine and an odor of mixed sweat  and strong body odor. It was awful and made us both gag. I rolled down the window and the fresh air outside wasnâ€™t any better. It took about a mile or two with the window rolled down to get that smell out. I drove up to her drive way and she got out without saying a word. Not a glance back or nothing. I drove home and didnâ€™t sleep that night at all. The following day I grabbed my 30-06  my 9mm  hunting knife  some binoculars and headed back to the spot we had been at the previous night. I found the same spot but another dusting of snow had hidden any trace of the hog or the Sasquatch. I drove close to the road edge back and forth still kind of scared of exiting my truck. I eventually parked on the side of the road and traced the trail that the boar and Sasquatch had. My rifle in my hands with the safety off  my 9 at my side unclipped and with the safety off  and I was still uneasy. I walked back and forth and never found anything other than divots in the snow where he had walked and even though I took pictures when I developed them there was nothing conclusive. Thinking back now I failed to measure the distance from one divot to the other because there were easily 3 of my strides between snowed in divots. I did find the sapling that he had grabbed to catapult himself up the mountain and it was broken at the base but nothing there for me to collect. I must have sat in my truck for an hour or two still in disbelief. I finally cranked up my truck and swore Iâ€™d never say a word to anyone and to this date I never had until I met someone with an incredible story like mine. A little background on me. I am a Texas bred and born man. I have hunted  fished  and camped all my life. I have taken down big game in Mexico  Texas  New Mexico  Tennessee  and Florida. I know what foxes  coyotes  wolves  deer  elk  and full grown bears look like. I am a former United States Marine  Desert Storm War Era veteran. Iâ€™m the kind of man that would tell people I could walk up to the devil  spit in his eye and ask him for a light. I am not a glory seeker as I could have been telling this story for years but have never done so prior meeting this gentleman at work. He asked me to sit down and draw what I saw and it was with amazing accuracy that I was able to draw everything I saw that night including the eyes. The eyes burned and glowed in the night like two red hot coals peering from behind this massive hand. Iâ€™ll never forget that look of those eyes. ,included in statement ,Sevier,10,Tennessee ,TN,Winter ,47155,yes
3780,Driving North and just crossed the border into Tennessee from North Carolina on Hwy #441 & #71  driving toward Gattlinburg  TN. It was getting dark so we drove on down the mountain. After a few minutes of driving around curves in the highway  we came to a straight section of the highway and could see street lights through the tree covered highway about a mile ahead. There was a curve in the highway where they were positioned. All of a sudden from our vantage point  the lights illuminated the shadow side of a very tall being crossing the highway from the left to the right which was less than a half mile in front of us. We all had a clear view of this being from the shadow side. It looked hairy and not clothed. It was walking on two feet the entire crossing of the highway. We could not see anything when we got to the area this  being had crossed due to darkness. It was ape like in my opinion and large. I found this website and although a its been a few years ago  I wanted to tell what my wife & I and our two friends saw & experienced. I think  Big Foot is in those woods            somewhere. ,From my GPS map  I think that we saw this being just before the crossing of Trout Branch ,Sevier,10,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47155,yes
3781,My husband and i were staying in a mountain cabin in the Pigeon Forge area of Tennessee this past week  and heard what we believe was the  call  of a sasquatch.  it was around 8 30-9 00 pm (EDT) on Tuesday  April 11  2006.  we were sitting on the back porch relaxing  and enjoying the quietitude of the evening.  the air was somewhat smokey  although clearing  as there had been some sort of fire/brush burn-off on another  near-by mountain  and the wind was blowing the smoke in our direction (mild breeze to the SSE).  it was not quite totally dark yet  but was past  dusk   and the moon was visible  though hazy  in sky.  the frogs were croaking  the birds were quiet  the squirrels were down for the night....no vehicles or people within earshot  we seemed to be the only cabin inhabited at that time---the weekenders had left  and no one had arrived to take their places yet.  anyway  all of a sudden  we heard this sound that i can only explain as a cross between a howl and a yell.  it was a vocalization without any real structure (no  words  or progression of sounds that could be construed as any sort of  language ).  it was definitely a mammal  and just as definitely not any canine  feline  bear  raccoon  or any other sort of animal one would expect to hear in the woods.  also obviously not any sort of livestock.  the sound seemed like it must have come from an animal at least man-sized/bear-sized  and sounded like an animal  calling   rather than making a warning sound or an identifying sound.  it carried what seemed to be a long way--sounded as if it came from the SSE  at least from the other side of the mountain next to us......would place it in the mountainy areas just west of Pigeon Forge  around the Walden  s Creek area.  the calling went on for 2-3 minutes.  it was a long  drawn-out sound  both nasal and  from the chest  (don  t know how to describe that).  if a human made the sound  it would definitely have to be a male  as it was too deep for a female human to do.  it would also have to be a person with a great deal of lung capacity  as each call went on for 10-15 seconds  and as noted before  came from a distance of at least a couple of miles.  the sound itself  best as i can describe would be vocalized thusly    hhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnuh .  and would go from a higher (baritone) note down to a deeper note at the end.  anyway  this went on for a few minutes  then all was quiet again (except for the  normal  woodsy noises).  there was no other recurrance that night or any other night that we heard  and we never saw anything.  we did  however hear some other noises which may or may not apply---a short time after the calls (15 minutes  or so)  we heard what sounded like something either throwing or pushing some VERY large rocks onto other rocks (heard rocks crashing onto each other).  This came from the same general direction  although seemed closer to us (on  our  side of the mountain).  This went on for a good 10 minutes  or so  then things got quiet again  and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The next night  there were some sounds like large fallen trees were  thumping  around in the woods  but there were other people in the area by then  too  so that could have been some idiots trying to go hiking at night and/or fooling around in the woods. FYI   my husband and i both have a good deal of knowledge of the sorts of wildlife found in the woods and mountains  as we both spent much of our childhoods in such places  and learned first-hand the calls and vocalizations of such animals.  this did not sound like anything either of has heard---including anything i  ve heard on any wildlife show on tv.  ; )  it did  however  sound a lot like some of the purported sasquatch/bigfoot vocalizations i  ve heard on some websites i  ve checked out. ,Can only say that it was in the Bluff Mountain area between Townsend and Pigeon Forge  as sounds are difficult to pinpoint. ,Sevier,10,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47155,no
3782,It was about 10 30 at night.  We were driving down a road to go to out cabin in the forest and we saw a large (about 6 or 7 feet.) ape like creature walking down the hill in front of out car. We (Me my mom dad and brother.) all sat there in out seats in awe then drove away quickly.We had been there the last night  at about 12 30 at night I had been asleep and my parents saw the creature for the first time and said it was probably a bear and drove off. But after we saw it the second time we knew it was no bear. We came back the next morning after the second sighting and we met another family that said they had seen the same thing about the same time. They said it came within five feet of their car. I never did ask what the face of the creature looked like. ,It was in the woods near some cabins that you could rent for a weekend. ,Sevier,10,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47155,yes
3783,It was late October of 2008  unsure of the exact date. At approximately 2 30 am  my oldest son called me on his cell phone. I was upstairs doing some research on the computer & he was downstairs on the back porch smoking a cigarette. I could tell by the tone of his voice that he was scared or excited about something. He said  â€œYou need to get out here right now  and bring the spot light and the shotgun with you!â€ I immediately retrieved both items from my bedroom and met him on the back porch. His eyes were as big as dinner plates and he looked a little pale. Now  my son (18 @ the time of this sighting) started hunting the swamps of north FL with me when he was 4  and he is normally very calm & doesnâ€™t get spooked or excited very easily. So  when I saw him like this I knew something had definitely gotten his attention. I said  â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€ He said  â€œPoint the light over there between the 2 sheds  at the oak tree.â€ I aimed the spotlight to where I thought he had indicated  but saw nothing. Then he said  â€œNo  beside the oak tree.â€ Again I aimed the light  but still didnâ€™t see anything. At this  he became agitated and grabbed my arm  moving the spotlight where he wanted it and exclaiming. â€œRight fâ€¦ing there!â€ The light revealed a large upright figure standing behind the oak tree. The animal was standing obliquely to us  using the tree to block our view. The tree was probably 3 Â½ to 4 feet in diameter  and about 30 yards from us  but we could still see it standing there  with the right side of its body at an angle to us. I noticed how the arms hung almost to its knees  and it stood slouched forward a bit  with its knees bent slightly. It was covered with brownish-red hair  maybe 2-3 inches long and appeared to be uniform in length except for the face  which appeared ape-like. It sounds funny  but the face looked similar to â€œHarryâ€ from â€˜Harry & the Hendersonsâ€™. As the animal stood there  I panned the spotlight off to the right from its location. When I did this  it half-stepped from behind the tree  peering to see what we were doing. When I brought the beam of light back  it immediately stepped back behind the oak tree  remaining at an oblique angle to our position. I again panned the light away to the right  and the animal again half-stepped to the right to see what we were doing. When the light came back  it again hid behind the tree. Almost in amusement  I turned the spotlight off for 3-4 seconds. I then pointed it directly at the tree and hit the on switch. The beam of light revealed the animal standing to the right of the oak tree  squarely facing us. When the light came on  the animal squinted and retreated back behind the oak tree  only this time it retreated back through the woods  using the tree to block our view of its departure. After we could no longer hear it crashing away through the brush  my son and I stood there shaking in amazement of what we had seen. After a moment  I finally managed to smile and said  â€œHoly crap dude  we just saw a sasquatch!â€ With that  my son replied  â€œThat was fricking awesome!â€ We went back inside and talked about the details of what weâ€™d seen for quite awhile before heading off to bed. The next morning   I went out to look for tracks where weâ€™d seen the late-night visitor. Here in east TN  the soil is mostly clay and not conducive to tracking  but I was still able to locate 2 footprints behind the oak tree. They measured just under 17 inches in length and about 6 Â½ inches wide across the ball of the foot. Also  there was another print in the leaf litter to the right of the tree  but it wasnâ€™t clear enough to measure. Due to the hardness of the soil  the tracks were not deep enough to cast. Further investigation did not yield any further tracks or spoor along the animalâ€™s route of egress. I have discussed this event with friends and co-workers  mostly being met with doubt and skepticism  but my son and I both have no doubt whatsoever about what we had seen. Before we moved out of that house due to divorce  we continued to observe strange occurrences from time to time but never had another visual encounter. ,If necessary  I can give the exact address  but don  t want it posted because we no longer live there and don  t want to cause problems for the new owners. ,Sevier,10,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47155,yes
3784,There were six of driving toward shelby forest one night just after dark.  We had probably driven 5 or 6 miles from Highway 51 when I was something run accross the road in front of the car just inside for the headlight range.  At the same time I saw this the driver of the car stopped immediately and looked around at everyone in the car.  Apparently he could tell by my look I saw it too and then asked me directly if I saw  it .  I said yes and then we drove in reverse until there was a turnaround between the divided highway and got out of there.  To this day I am not sure what it was that I saw but it was on two feet and very fast.  Watkins extended is divided  and it crossed 4 traffic lanes and the median in just a couple of seconds.  It was very big black and looked like it was covered with fur.  It was hard to tell exactly since it was just inside the headlight range and happened very quicky.  It ran with a slight forward tilt and with very little arm bend.  No one else in the car saw it besides myself and the driver. ,Turned off US Highway 51 towards shelby forest down Watkins extended.

3785,In late October of 1993 my brother and I were deer hunting on a large farm in Piney Flats Tennessee. Piney Flats is located halfway between Bristol and Johnson City. The farm bordered Boone Lake. A lake that had been made in the 1930  s and 1940  s with the construction by The Tennessee Valley Authority.I had scouted the area the evening before so I could have an idea of where I would be hunting.I entered the woods well before daylight the next morning. I was hunting with a single shot muzzle loader.I sprayed myself with human scent shield prior to entering the woods.I walked through a high grass field crossed a barb-wire fence and entered the woods. I walked up a ridge and sat down on top of a large rock facing that was protruding out of the side of the hill. Where I was sitting was directly above the trail that the deer had been traveling.I could see shapes of trees and the outline of the woods against the fence. I began to hear something walking in the high grass of the field to my right.I then heard the barbed-wire cling together as if it something had crossed it.I then heard the leaves begin to crunch and crush underneath steps being taken.I could see something walking in a zig zag pattern below me. The pattern continued but it was slowly walking toward me. I then began to hear the sound of a grunt and low toned growl.As the figure came closer I could make out the shape of a man walking up the hill in a zig zag pattern. As I continued to watch the thought ran through my head that someone had walked upon my spot to hunt and then I realized that the gentleman who owned the farm had only allowed my brother and myself to hunt.The rock I was sitting on was approximatly seven and a half to eight feet off of the ground. This figure was standing five to six feet infront of me but was looking me eye to eye.It grunted and growled in a low tone as if someone who was congested or out of breath.(thats the only way I can describe it)I could make out the shape of hair that was around the head area.I could also distinguish shoulders  arms and a torso.The shoulders were very wide and no neck was visible.I coughed as if to alert that I was already hunting this spot. The figure continued to stand in front of me and breath heavily.I then waived my hand and coughed again.At this point the figure turned walking back down hill on two legs swinging its arms and going the same direction it had came from.I observed the figure until it walked out of my sight and hearing range.No one believes me.At one time  this area was populated with members of the Cherokee Tribe. I have always heard of legends out west by Native Americans but never in this part of the country.I have spoken with one other person who has wittnessed the figure about one mile from where I did.With my encounter I detected no smell  but truth be told I was so astonished I wouldn  t know if I had. ,See Report ,Sullivan,3,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47163,yes
3786,I always tell this story whenever there is big foot conversation. However  I have never reported the incident to an official source. The creature was witnessed by myself  my sister  brother-in-law  my brother  and two of my cousins (both male.) Here  s the real nutty part. The sighting was in Hendersonville  TN. Whereas there was (at the time of sighting) a lot of wooded land  it is by no means a wilderness. At the time of sighting  Hendersonville was experiencing phenomenal growth.  Here  s what happen. My brother Eddie  my two cousins James and Larry and I were spending the weekend with my sister (Nell) and brother-in-law (Leo). Their  s was a new house next to the last one in the development at that time. The subdivision was a new one cut into some of the wooded area of Hendersonville. We turned int the driveway of the house and when the headlights from the car straighten down the driveway Leo abruptly stopped the car and said   What the hell is that?  We all looked. The creature was digging in the trash can at the end of the driveway(its right side towards us). As the lights hit it  it turned and looked in our direction then looked in the direction of its regress (never looked in our direction again) and casually stride away. Leo got out of the car and went through the front door of the house and got his gun. We all watched as the creature ran (not fast) away on two legs. Never did it drop on all fours. It was not even built for all fours. It was man-like (and please  give us some credit  it was not a bear)about eight feet tall and completely covered with medium dark brown hair. When Leo got back outside the creature was gone. The next door neighbor  s dog (always barking at us and everything else) did not make a sound and we found him hiding under the neighbor  s back deck. At the time of this sighting  we had never heard of a big foot. We did not even think to look for hair of footprints or anything like that. This may sound a little odd  but we saw what we saw. I realize since this incident occurred such a long time ago  it will probably be of no interest but since I had never reported this incident to an official researcher  I wanted to do so.

3787,This happened in May/June of 1986. I was visiting a friend  s farm near Portland  TN. My friend   J   wanted to make preparations for his upcoming birthday party  he wanted a campout of sorts. I offered to help him get firewood. So  J and I went to the woods near his farm  accompanied by his dog to gather the firewood. While we were in the woods  his dog started to act very strange. Refusing to obey J  s command  s and breaking for the nearest open field. We followed the dog until we stopped to notice that several trees were stripped of their bark. The tree bark had been completely removed and then we noticed that the branches on several of the trees were snapped off. This upset J very much that he wanted to leave the woods to tell his father. J marked the spot by sticking his knife in the ground and said that we  d come back with his father. And so we left the woods and J  s dog came with us too. J walked me over to his father  s barn and told me to sit tight as he went to get his father. The dog stayed with me when J left  but for some reason the dog didn  t want to be in the barn. So  I let the dog out and it went to the nearby watering pond  and so I followed the dog. While at the pond  I decided to have a sit with the dog. Shortly afterward  the dog turned and started barking. I turned around to see what the dog was barking at and then I saw it! A little over 100 feet away from me  it was standing at the electric fence separating the field from the woods. The creature stood near some trailers used to haul tobacco during harvest time. This creature stood head and shoulders taller than the trailers. It was very tall  had reddish-brown hair  muscular build  stood upright and had a very gorilla-like face. Scared  I dropped to the ground and kept watching it. The creature sniff the air and grunted some as the dog kept barking at it. Then suddenly  it turned and run back into the woods  shortly after that J  s dad arrived in his truck. J  s dad got out of his truck with a shotgun and asked if I had seen it. I pointed at the woods and said it just ran off. J  s dad mumbled about something attacking his cows and then asked J to take him to where we had found the trees stripped of bark. I told J  s dad that it was just there moments before he had arrived  J  s dad decided to check the spot before going into the woods. At the spot where the creature had stood were footprints in the dirt. J  s dad was a tall man and wore cowboy boots. He placed his foot inside the track  the track was larger then his boot. He mumbled something  looked at J and said that they  d come back for J  s knife later. J  s dad said he  d take back to the house  and while we rode in his truck  he asked us not to say anything to J   mother about this. ,A day or so later  J told me that he accompanied his father  along with some other friends  to the spot where we  d had found the trees. Said the knife was still in the ground. Mentioned that they found additional tracks. A month or so after that  he said there was a nighttime sighting of something crossing a neighbor  s field. ,Sumner,4,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47165,yes
3788,Me and three of my friends were coon hunting.  We were sitting around waiting on the dogs to strike and we heard something rustling in the leaves behind us.  It was a bright night out and we were right on the bank of the Hatchie River.  In the direction that we heard the noise was a small bluff and then went into an open field.  Due to the brightness of the moon it almost looked like daylight in that field.  When we turned to see what was making the noise we saw the monster on the edge of the field.  All we could see was a perfect outline of the creatures body.  It was very fast on it  s feet.  We never saw it stand still.  The first time we turned around we saw it run across the edge of the field  faster than any other animal could run.  Everyone was shocked and was asking one another if they saw it too.  Seconds later it ran across again  this time it went from upright to all fours and back upright  it never broke stride.  It appeared to be about 6  5  to 8   tall and weigh about 225 to 275lbs.  It was hairy but not like you see in  bigfoot  movies.  It was very agile and robust. ,Our sighting occurred just outside of Covington  TN in the outer edges of Tipton County.

3789,Depth finder read at the entrance of the channel approx 3   but fell to 8   and greater once into the channel. The deeper back we went the better the fish were biting. My husband manned the trolling motor on the front of the boat and me on the back end. Just slowly and enjoying the day and the fish that were biting and the sounds of the wildlife. We could hear the carp slapping the water surface deeper up the channel. We were there a good two hours. Husband looked up to start deeper into the channel but saw a dark  black  bulky body standing behind brush hunched over looking at us. He studied it and finally said to me  well what the hell is that...(mumbled something).... and I asked him what/where... I saw the bushes moving slowly up into the woods as if someone/thing was fast-walking. He said to be quiet until we got backed out of the channel. It haunts him still and we are trying to logic out what he saw. The odd thing was that just before my husband said he was seeing something  I got a day-ja-vue feeling and felt we were not alone  because the birds stopped their activity and went from feeling content and calm to feeling spooked. Like when crickets stop singing when disturbed. Was crazy  just can  t explain it. My husband was scared and I never saw him act that way before. I know he saw something  I saw something moving the bushes cutting up into the woods. He first thought it to be the  back end  of a black bull/cow. Then he thought it to be a moonshiner or a big black man hiding. It was black and not in shadows. He saw no facial features and no outline of a head. That make sense?? It darted away quickly up into the woods as he commented to me that he was seeing this..... I saw the bushes moving up into the woods. We left. ,In a runoff channel across from the lake chute.

3790,On Sunday night July 15 (about midnight) I walked out of my garage and I smelled something musky  like a buck in rut or wet dog and I commented to my father about that  but just shrugged it off. It was overcast that night. On that particular night  across the road at another neighbors house  I could hear dogs barking  figured they were barking at coyotes or deer  at about the same time I could smell that musky smell. On July 16th  I walked out of my garage to leave for work at about 7 30 am  when I noticed that one of the trees in my yard had a limb that was hanging down. I did not think anything of it at the time  except that I thought it was weird  since on the day before  there were no storms  heavy wind and the limb was fine  because I had mowed around the tree on the afternoon of July 15. I returned home from work at 5 pm  changed clothes and decided to go look at the limb. I noticed that the limb was not broken in two  like someone had hung on it  but twisted so that is split. I took some clippers and cut it off.  The more I thought about it  the more I was puzzled  so I decided to go out to the burn pile that I had laid it on  and cut the twist out of the limb and take it inside to study closer. Showing my father  we both were puzzled. The limb looked like if you took a rope and twisted it  and the middle of the rope separates. Enclosed are some photos that I took of the area  the limb and tree  along with an aerial photo showing where the tree is located and the layout of the land. I did search for footprints and any other evidence  but there were none to be found. I will also be getting the twist checked out  I only wish I would have kept it together and on the tree to begin with  since it would have been easier to study. Lesson learned this time. There has been no further sightings  or damage found since. ,Removed at witness request. ,Tipton,4,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47167,yes
3791,Saw a large brown/black mostly black animal in the middle of the woods and it stood about 7-7 1/2 ft tall and we did not hear it but it just sneaked up on us and made me feel like the prey insted of the hunter. As it got within 75 yards it stopped and turned forty five degrees to the left and went through a hollow and walking out of sight.  We were amazed and tried to track it. ,Do not remember   but a pull off close to 27 at a pull off near the south end of the county. ,Morgan,17,Tennessee ,TN,Winter ,47129,yes
3792,I was told this story by my father I will do my best to remember the details. my dad and a friend [ jerry ] were going fishing i dont know road names but have general information of the location it was 30 mins. drive from clarksville tn. he said they had to drive over old rail road tressel to get to fishing spot. there were horses and cows in a field grazing they crossed a cattel gap and parked. they walked down an embankment to the cumberland river.and procceded to fish.my dad said there was a lot of muskrat activity along the bank of the river. they had been there about 45 mins.[with no fish lol ] my dad said all of a sudden  everything seemed to stop no wildlife noise no muskrats ect.he said he piced up a .22 rifle and a spot light then walked to the top ofthe embankment he looked towards te fence line where the cows were with the light he said he saw a set of red eyes along the fence estimated height was 7-8 foot tall. he said he aimed rifle between the eyes and shot he said he heard the impact of the bullet and the eyes closed he fierd several more times and heard impact but never saw anything after the eyes closed. he went back down to get his pole jerry and my dad [frank] didnt rel the poles in they broke the line and left.when they got back to cattle gap he said there were all the cows horses and a few deers jammed up against the fence and they had to nudge the animals with their vehicle to get across the gap.needless to say the never went back! ,Montgomery County TN.

3793,I was 15 years old. A friend and I were hiking down a trail in Cherokee National forest. We were headed to Slick rock creek to do some fly fishing. I was slightly ahead of my buddy on the trail. About 50-60 yards ahead of me some kind of animal crossed the trail. This creature was in plain view for about 5-10 seconds. It was trotting on all fours. It was mostly white or off white. this thing was big. It was the size of a large bear. I would guess at least 300 lbs. Its hair was kind of shaggy. More shaggy than that of a bear. at first I looked at my buddy and asked if he seen the thing. He said yes. I asked  what was it . He did not know but descibed the thing exactly the way that I seen it. The ground in this area was rock hard so no tracks were left. I am now 34 years old  but that memory has stuck with me ever since. Of course no one has ever really believed this story  but ever since I have had a huge interest in big foot and crytozoology. ,If you want to go their I will show you.

3794,I grew up in a very rural area of Tennessee.  My grandparents had a farm that lies on the border of Monroe and McMinn counties.  I was playing in the garage which is downhill from the house.  Across the road was a wooded area.  As I was playing I felt like someone was staring at me.  I looked up to find what I first thought was a very hairy man looking at me until I realized it didn  t have on any clothes.  I became very frightened and dropped to the ground between cars and rolled up in underneath the car. It was dark  brown to black in color.  It was about seven feet tall as best that I can guess  It  s facial features were similar to a humans.  I am pretty sure that it saw me.  I hid as soon as I saw it because it scared me quite badly. I  lay there for approximately 15 minutes. After awhile I heard men talking and crawled out from underneath the car.  I ran into the house and stayed  there for the rest of the day.  When I went into the house my mother asked  me what was wrong as I looked like I had seen a ghost.  At the time this area was thickly wooded.  These woods were soon cut down.  There are still wooded breaks between fields.  It was around two or three in the afternoon.  The time of year was around fall to early winter as I  can remember wearing a coat. The farm is approximately seven miles from  the town of Madisonville   TN and three miles out of Englewood  TN.  It lies one mile from US HWY 411 in what is known as the Chestua community. Several of my relatives still live here. ,Seven miles from  the town of Madisonville   TN and three miles out of Englewood  TN.

3795,in 1979 a friend and I were taking a hike on TVA land in Columbia tn. At that time the area was deserted my x-father in law owned 20 acres that backed up to TVA which met Duck River on the back. We were walking and suddenly 20yds or less away out of the bush in wide open there he was. We froze and we all stared at each other If he had been violent you wouldn  t hear this story. He turned made an awful growling scream and was gone. Later that day my brother and I went back and searched only to find a 4 inch tree about 6 ft up freshly took and twisted to splinters.  The farm was part of our area and since this sighting we were not scared when so many times we knew he was near  we were never attacked.

3796,I was 12 years old  working for my father at a construction sight off of a dirt road  just north of Chapel Hill  TN.  My dad and uncles were building a house for Rickey Sweeney  early in the summer. My uncles  Ricky and Jimmy and I took the work truck to a small country store to get a midmorning snack for the crew.  On our way back to the work sight  we turned onto the dirt road  lined with thick overhanging trees.  We went about a quarter of a mile  when from our left (South) a very tall (7   +)  somewhat slender animal  covered with dark fur  head to toe  ran into the middle of the road and stopped as my uncle slammed on the brakes. The bipedal was about 50 feet away.  All three of us started screaming  and my unlce Ricky tried to get the truck into reverse gear.  The animal had what looked like pieces of clothing under one arm and dragging on the road.  The animal broke itself out of it  s fright and bounded off north  across the road  jumping a 4 and 1/2 foot fence and up the hill  quickly disappearing. We returned to the work sight and I proceeded to tell everyone there about the remarkable incedent.  This story has been coaberated by my father and both uncles  and has been an exciting experience to relate to others. ,Go north on highway 31A from Chapel Hill  TN.

3797,Earlier this year i was camping by myself in the Citico Creek area. Around Ten oclock P.M. i was in my hammock (i dont use a tent i go lightweight)when i heard something i guess you could say running down a steep hill across the trail from me.At first i thought it was a deer or some other animal but it stopped and started moving parallel with the trail. So i get up and get my fire going again to try and spook what ever it was off. Whatever was moving (ill just say IT from now on)went down about fifty yards and crossed the trail over to my side. I was kind of freaking out because it was so overgrown with vegatation that a flashlight was almost useless.I could hear IT cross back over the trail and move up the hill and come back the way IT came. It went past my camp about fifty yards or so and crossed the trail this time above where i was.About this time i figured out that it wasnt an animal so i was freaking out a little.This went on for about four or five hours off and on.When the sun came up i got out of there.I told some friends about what happened they thought it was probably a deer or maybe a dog but it sounded way to heavy for either of those.I done some research and came across your sight and kind of got it out of my system you could say but i saw where you guys had a expedition to North Carolina and saw some articles where people had encounters around the N.C. and T.N. border well thats where i was. ,From 165 take a right to Indian Boundary campground take the first right before you get to the campground go about four miles on the gravel road its the first pull off on the right follow the trail for about a mile or so my camp was on the left ,Loudon,1,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47105,no
3798,when we toped a small hill and started down the other side  i saw a large hairy thing walking by the corn that was not taking up. I stopped the car in the road ( on this road you might see a car  one in 30 minutes)  and said whats that. My wife  sitting on passenger side  looked and saw it to  my oldest son was in the back seat  but to small to remember. this thing( I call it that because no one acts like they believe) was walking to the right a couple of steps  turned and took 3 steps to the left  turned and walked back the way we first saw it  it was taller than the corn stalks  hairy  dark brown or black  it was swinging it arms as it walk and slightly leaning fowards  ( the film of the bigfoot they show on t.v. is the same  but I dont remember it looking at us). we watched it until it walked into the trees by the creek. We turned right in the small road that goes to her parents house. we stopped on the other side of the trees with the creek in the middle and did not see it again. we went to the house and told her parents. We ask ourselve`s even today why we did not go and look for it or tracks. I think my father in law and i where going deer hunting? ,from Nashville south on 65 to exit 53.

3799,hello all i am a 56 year old woman that has never gave a second thought to the life of what people call a bigfoot.I knew him as whistling Paddy as a child that is what my Grandparents and all the neighbors called him.Our neighbors were far and few between but every one of them knew the whistling paddy that is what they called him.I myself can remember his screaming and whistling sounds as a child.We lived in the deep woods in Ethridge Tennessee no electricty or indoor plumming.He was always around and we were used to his sounds and he came for scraps at night he did not eat any meat only pealings from patatoes and other veg.He or she was white with red eyes like as i know some folks are called alibalino i guess.My grandparents were not learned people they could not read or wright they had to sgin with an x but they knew he was real and they did not fear him and saw him or her lots of times and thought it was okay they called it him so i guess it was a male.My aunt who lived about a mile awat opened her back door one night to throw out her dishwater and threw it on patty because he was standing at the back door It did not scare her because she was used to him although she had 9 children she went and got some potatoes and gave him for she said he was hungry.This Paddy was about 7 to 8 feet tall and did not ever hurt anyone.I would like to know if anyone else has ever heard one called a whistling Paddy because that was what he was called when I was a small child growing up in those woods.And we did not fear him but we had to come inside right before dark cause mamaw would say paddy is out here and we can  t trust him we dont know who he is.If anyone else ever knew of a bigfoot that was called  by the name of whistling Paddy i would like to know my grandparents were Indian and knew many things but were not smart when it came to the real world they knew how to get by with 10 children and live a good life in the woods and how spider webs packed into a wound would stop bleeding and they knew as i did paddy was real. ,This was 53 years ago it was in Ethridge Tennessee i don  t remember how to get back to the old farm place but even if i did it is not the same anymore so much land has been cleared ,Lawrence,24,Tennessee ,TN,Unknown ,47099,no

We were in a car  my husband was driving and I was sitting in the middle  my brother-in-law sitting beside the passanger door. As we were going down Hwy.88 I saw a creature that was about 7 foot tall and weighed about 245 lb. It was completly but lightly covered with dark brown (black) long hair. As we were riding and our car lights hit it  I saw it on the right side of the road. It stood there for a moment observing the oncoming car. I stared at it  and it stared back at me for a brief moment. As I was looking at its eyes  I noticed a reddish tint. His features reminded me of a cross between ape and man. It was standing upright on two feet. And like a human it ran across the road. The speed with which it ran across  was unlike any I have ever known. I asked my brother-in-law if he had seen it? He said he saw something cross the road  but it was so fast he thought it was maybe a deer. He couldn  t say for sure what it was  because he was carring on a conversation with my husband. Still to this day I will not go down there after dark. ( February 11  2000 ) ,About 4-5 miles West of Chestnut Bluff in Hailspoint Bottoms on Highway 88 West.

3801,I was turkey hunting with a friend of mine on some land on the banks of the Duck River.  I have heard of no reports of Bigfoot in the area nor seen or heard of any signs of Bigfoot around there so this is probably nothing  but this is what happened. There are few houses in the area. There are many small valleys  dense hardwood forests  and a lot of crop land planted mainly with soybeans or wheat.  It was a good place for turkey hunting.  I saw 20 or 30 the day before the season opened.  I was about two miles deep in the woods from the road where my truck was parked.  It was getting dark fast so I started walking back to the truck on a dirt road. It got so dark that I could not see ten feet in front of me.  Shortly after I started walking down the road  something started walking in the woods near me.  It sounded like it was about one hundred feet away.  I could not see it at all.  I smelled no strange smells either.  Whatever it was  it kept a constant pace with me.  At first I thought that it might be a deer because I knew there were no bears in that area.  I wasn  t worried about whatever it was at first because it was not coming any closer.  It was just keeping pace.  I still thought it was probably a deer until I heard it step on a fallen tree.  When it stepped on the tree  the tree snapped in two. It sounded like a rather large tree also.  I know this because I lived on a farm most of my life  and we would clear land with a bulldozer and tractors so I knew what different size trees sounded like when they snap in two. When I heard that tree break  that got my attention because whatever broke it was extremely heavy.  I got a little scared too because all I had was a shotgun. I decided to see if it would keep up with me if I ran so I ran for about one hundred yards  and it kept up but got no closer.  I stopped running though because it was so dark I was afraid I would trip or hit a tree.  This thing followed me for about ten minutes and when I started getting close to the road  it stayed further following completely. We slept in the truck all night so we could hunt the next day also  but we heard no screams or strange noises as reported by many people so I have no idea what it was.

3802,It was early one morning  probally around 6 00 am  and i was up and decided to go into the kitchen and wash dished from the night before while my children were asleep.  We were renting a house right off hwy 100 in Hickman County.  It was an older farm house and had several acers of fenced in land back behind it.  About half way in the middle of this field behind the house  it was crossed fenced from one tree line across to another tree line.  So  after I had finished the dishes I walked over to the back window in the kitchen.  I looked out and right past where the feild was cross fenced  I saw something walking.  I took a second look because I could not beliece what I had just seen.  It was a very large creature walking as if it were in a big hurry to cross the field to get to the trees on the opposite side.  It was tall enough that I could see down to it  s legs over the fence.  It was a tan color with places that were darker as if it were wet or muddy.  It  s hair was long on it  s arms and on it  s face.  I could only really see it  s eyes and nose for the hair.  when it passed a break in the fence  I could see that it  s legs were also covered in long hair. I watched it until it disappeared into the trees on the other side of the field.  I had even ran from the kitchen window into the bedroom window to watch it.  I never went down to look for tracks that it might have left because I was too scared.  And I also never told anyone for a long time because they might think that I was crazy.  They still to this day think that I am crazy but I believe what I saw was the real thing.  I believe I saw bigfoot.  And I will always say that I did. ,It is located right off Hwy 100 in Hickman Co  TN the house that I lived in is about 1 1/2 miles east of the Hwy 100 & Hwy 7 intersection.

3805,I  my wife and 2 sons were living on a remote farm in Hawkins Co TN. One nite around 11 PM directly behind the house screaming started. It was like the combination  of a woman  large cat and a mule. It took place in a cedar thicket up on a hill. I ran outside on the porch to see what was going on. I could also here the sound of trees cracking or thrashing The screaming kept up for approximatly 1 1/2 hrs. The house itself sat on a bench  surrounded by ridges or in a bowl so to speak. What ever was making the screams and growls   did so while circling the house on the ridges.

I coul see a dark shape  but it was misty and still a little dark. After about 4-5 minutes it turned and ran off.

3808,I DON  T KNOW WHERE TO START WITH THIS! I AM A 38 YR OLD MAN AND A OFFICER OF THE STATE TELLING YOU ABOUT A BIG FOOT. THE FIRST TIME I ENCOUNTERED IT I WAS ON THE WAY INTO TOWN.  THIS ANIMAL WAS ABOUT 6 TO 7 FT TALL AND RAN OUT OF THE WOODS IN FRONT OF ME.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A BEAR  BUT BEARS DONT RUN STANDING ON THIER HIND LEGS AND BEARS IN THIS AREA AREN  T THAT TALL.  I JUST CHALKED IT UP TO THAT IT WAS A BEAR.  UP UNTIL OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. I AM AN ADVID HUNTER AND OUTDOORSMAN.  I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD JUST ABOUT EVERY ANIMAL IN THE WOODS OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY.  ONE AFTERNOON IN MID OCTOBER I WENT OUT TO FEED MY CHICKENS WHEN I SAW SOMETHING SHINEING IN THE WOODS ACROSS THE GULLY FROM MY HOME.  AS I APPROACHED THIS SHINEY OBJECT I REALIZED IT WAS A BALLOON.  I WAS ABOUT TO REACH DOWN AND PICK THE BALLOON UP WHEN I HEARD THIS AWEFUL  CRYING  ANGRY  HURT  MAD  DEEP WITHIN  A HUGE SCREAM THAT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING SOUND I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE THAT MADE THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK STAND UP.

3809,My fiance and I were camping out on the banks of the Duck River last summer. Around 2 a.m. we could hear dogs from across the river barking. (It was also a full moon.) All of a sudden  from down the river (it sounded like  anyway) we heard a loud deep howl (just like the recordings of Big Foot on tv) that lasted almost ten seconds. All of the dogs  critters  etc. that were making noise went completely silent. We waited up kind of scared  but never heard it again and the dogs  etc. never made any other noises either. My fiance is an avid hunter and knows all of the sounds out in woods day or night. He says he has never heard anything like that before. Whatever it was  it had to be something that all of the other animals knew to fear. ,Along the Duck River in Middle TN. ,Hickman,3,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47081,no
3810,While on a day trip to a very remote local cemetery in the pine barrens near Appleton  Tennessee my family and friends observed a freshly fallen tree across Sugar Creek about 150 yards south of the Mt. Zion Church entryway. Visitors have to cross a low water bridge on Sugar Creek at this point. Was a very pleasant day in May (31st)  with blue skies and a light breeze. After about a half an hour we heard what could only be described as the most unholy sound any of us have ever heard coming from the area past the fallen tree on Sugar Creek (about 1000yds away from us). It was no cow  donkey  horse  etc. My wife and best friend heard this sound and in fact captured it on our camcorder. It is nowhere as loud as it was in person  but I do have it recorded. ,From Hwy 43  turn onto Rabbit Trail Rd. continue about 30 miles to Blooming Grove Rd.  turn left and continue to Revilo Rd.

3811,My husband and I saw a what we believe to be a Sasquatch on the night of June 12  2021. We were driving home together with our daughter at approximately 9 30 PM when we turned onto our street. Mind you  we live in the deep country side outside of Lawrenceburg Tennessee. My husband turned the wheel slightly to turn onto our street and there was an animal with fingers touching something on the ground  picking at it with its fingers. When the animal saw our headlights turning  it intentionally averted the headlights and ducked underneath them. It was only about five feet from the front of our vehicle at one point when we turned toward it. It was fully in the headlights. The animal bounded across our neighbors yard. It did not run on two feet the way a human would. We thought the animal was a gorilla at first because of its movements but it looked extremely human like. It bounded with its front legs in the same way that a gorilla does except itâ€™s arms were so long and it moved unbelievably fast. Of course we considered that it could have been a person dressed in a hairy costume but it moved way too fast to be a person. It was definitely not a bear. It was more like a gorilla or person covered with hair. It was covered in dark brown or black hair. The animal cleared our neighbors 250-300 foot grass lawn in about six seconds and then it disappeared from view. Our daughter who is four did not see the animal as she was playing on her iPad. When we pulled up to our house a minute later I was absolutely terrified to get out of the vehicle because we had no idea what we had seen  and because it was so fast that it could have turned around and been to our house in about 10 seconds. I got up the courage to run to my house door and unlocked it and we all ran inside. We were terrified. We both saw the animal  however it was my husband who saw that it had fingers and it was observing something on the ground. I did not see that part. I just saw the part where it started to run and when it cleared our neighbors lawn. We had considered that maybe it was a bear but it was too ape like to have been a bear and it was too fast and slim and did not run on all four of its legs exactly the way a bear would have. ,Intersection of glen springs road and ridge lane.

3812,I was 17 and had an 11 30 curfew.  I had left my girlfriend  s house a little later than I should and was in a hurry to get home.  I traveled Howell Hill Rd to Teal Hollow Rd.  On Teal Hollow Rd I was speeding down a long straight away and saw something on the side of the road.  I thought it was a deer or cow at first  so I slowed down.  As I got closer to it  it stood up.  As I passed it I was still going fast  about 55 or 60.  I then thought it was a person who had crashed their car so I hit my brakes.  By this time I was past it.  I stoped in the road about 100 to 200 yards past it.  When I put the car in reverse to back up I could see that it had walked into the road behind me.  I probably got to within 25 to 30 yards of it when I realized it was much bigger than a person. It was dark so I do not have a great description. It scared me.  I threw the car in drive and floored it.  I drove like a bat out of heck until I got to HWY 64.  When I got home I was still shaking and still had tears in my eyes.  I do not know what I saw  but it was big  looked to be 6 1/2 to 7ft and almost half the width of my car.  20 yrs have past and I still will not drive that road anytime close to dark.  I get cold chills everytime I think about what happened.  It scared the heck out of me  whatever it was ,Teal hollow Rd. I was going west.

3813,My neice went out to roll the windows up on my daughters car when she heard someone hollering at her.  She looked toward a field next to the house and seen something white standing there. It kept making the noise and spooked her so she ran back in the house to tell us. Shortly after this our dogs started barking. My daughters boyfriend took a flashlight out next to the fence to see if he could see anything. He ran in the house to get the gun because he heard some movement. When he returned to the fence he shined the flashlight toward the woods again. What he saw stunned him for a few seconds. He said it was a huge white fury creature. He fired the gun and the creature stumbled and took off runing. While all this was taking place my daughter and neice were standing on the porch and witnessed the whole thing. They seen enough of the creature to describe it as being a huge  white furry creature on two feet instead of four. They also heard the low deep grunt my neice had already heard earlier. ,We are located approx 15 miles SE of Fayetteville TN    Near Teal Hollow  We are also just a few miles from Flintville where other sighting have been reported ,Lincoln,16,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47103,yes
3814,On December 9  2000  3 30 pm I was working two of my horses near the barn. I saw my mares in the pasture looking in the woods. The mares were 100 feet from the woods  I with my stallion 400 feet (approx.) from the mares.  I thought a dog or deer may be in the woods. I standing on the ground working the stallion around me  look in the direction of the mares and see what I thougt was a teenager standing at the tree line. This made me angry that a kid would be that for on the property that I was leaseing.I looked again and noticed that the kid was wareing a very heavy coat. This was strange because it was 45 to 50 degrees out. From head to just above the knees was what looked like a light grey parka.I could not see below the knees. I was not afraid at what I was seeing .At the onset of the observation I thought that this was a teen age boy. The more I looked the more odd things seemed. The object stood up on two legs and swayed back and forth a few times. When it swayed I could tell that the  hair  was longer than expected and the swaying was not that of a human.My mind then began to try to decide what this was  a boy or what. At this time I still did not relate this with a Yeti or Sasquatch type animal. The incident took 10 to 15 seconds from first visual contact. Upon turning with the horse back to the direction of the animal it was gone. I did not see it walk to the edge of the woods or see it walk away. I do realize that this is not a alot of information but this is the first time I have ever seen anything that I could not give a name to or have seen before. I went into work on the 11 of December and mention this to some coworkers that were borned and raised here.One is a hunter. I asked with out telling him of my sighting.He told me that his freinds on many occasion have seen  yetis  over the years.The sightings were at least 20 miles from my sighting and they were dark brown or black. Mine being very light grey. I go to another person that I know has lived in this area all his life. I ask him  have you ever seen a animal that you did not know what it was  as in a strange animal.He told me that he has not seen any such thing   but a few years ago the football couch and his friend drop off a young student after a game. While going home on a country road both gentlemen saw a animal that looked like a very tall big man coverd in hair. Other people make jokes when I ask  if they have seen any such sightings.What I saw may have been a teen age boy but I don  t think so.I will have a camera with a zoom lense with me when I work my hoses. I will also try and find any evedence to prove one way or the other what I saw. , ,Marshall,8,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47117,yes
3815,I was sixteen then  I  m 27 now but I remember this as if it happened yesterday. I was up late reading a book by Billy Graham. My dogs had been acting up all night barking and sometimes trying to get in the house. I lived on a ranch about 20  miles away from the Smoky Mountains.  It had been raining all night and I thought I heard a noise outside my back door which I was facing.  I looked up but didn  t see anything in the porch light so I thought it was just one of the dogs scratching on the door. Suddenly they went wild barking and going crazy and I heard them run around to the back and I stood up to see what was wrong and as I stood I saw a figure walk by my door and stop.   What ever it was it was huge it was taller than my door which was seven feet high and it was very broad and very hairy  it was tan or dark blond at least it looked that color in the porch light. It made these funny whistling grunting sounds.  All I could see of it was its shoulders and part of its left arm. Then all of a sudden my light on the porch went out and I was petrified... in the lightening I saw it walking away so I sort of crawled over to the door to look out and I decided to open the door for a better look. When I did open the door  this odor hit me  gagging me. My dogs had ran under the house and wouldn  t come out.  I could tell they were quite scared as well cause the were whining. then lightening flashed again and that  s when I saw it about 30 feet away just standing there not really looking at me but more toward the house  then it made the weirdest noise  like a baby crying   then it whistled again and in the distance on up in the woods I swear I heard the exact same whistle or cry or whatever it was. It was dark  but I could here it crashing through the woods and I guessed it was leaving.  I had moved toward the side of my door and slipped and fell on some glass and cut my self pretty bad  that  s when I discovered that my porch light had been knocked out. I never saw any footprints because I had cut my knee pretty bad and had to go to the hospital  it also rained all night and by the time I could go out and investigate all I found was broken tress and branches which didn  t prove much because anything could have done it. I just know what I saw was no bear.  Black bears do not get that big or that broad. ,Calhoun TN  near Athens  TN about 85 miles out of Knoxville ,Mcminn,2,Tennessee ,TN,Unknown ,47107,yes

3817,I believe it was May 2010  I was with my son and was crossing railroad tracks  I looked down the tracks and said to my son what is that  about a block or so down the tracks was a creature standing in the middle of the tracks  it was big shaggy  light brown  standing on two legs...I didn  t know what to think except that I saw a bigfoot...this happened in Monroe County Tenn. ,middle of railroad tracks  trees  wooded area ,Monroe,23,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47123,yes
3818,I was driving my car home from my  girlfriend  s house. So I took this one road  because it was a faster way home for me at the time. The road  is hilly and nobody lives on this road. Just an old house which no one has lived in years. The time of  night was just before midnight. I remember this time  because I had to be home at midnight. So I got on  this road from Goolinghorn Rd. and started on down  it. When you get on the road it starts to go downhill  at a good pace. I was going down the hill for about  1/4 of a mile and I remember seeing what looked like a deer. It was brown  real hairy and was on all  fours. Thinking that it was a deer  a pretty good  size deer. So I slowed down thinking I was going to get a look at a deer  which in my town is pretty common. Well I got about a hundred yards from this thing when it stood up on two feet and took off running in the woods. I will tell you it scared the daylights out of me. I remember watching this  I guess I can say Bigfoot  running into the darkness and I looked back at the road and there was some roadkill in the middle of the road. Well I took off right after it took off and did not look back. It did not make any sounds. It was real quiet even when it ran in the woods. But there was a real foul smell  but that might have been the roadkill.  ,The incident occur on a old back road in  Montgomery County. Near the town of Palmyra   Tennessee.

3819,My wife and I were new to the area so we decided to check out Frozen Head State Park.  We drove there in the early afternoon and decided to try to walk one or two of the trails in the park.  We took our two dogs with us as they love to hike  and if no one else is near us  we let them off leash so they can run up and down the trail.  Today was different.  The dogs never got more than a couple of yards from us and seemed stressed.  We thought their conduct was odd  but credited their behavior to the fact that they had not been out much since we just moved.   We started along the Interpretive Trail loop near the Old Mac Trail head.  We were enjoying ourselves as there was no one else on the trail.  We stopped next to a creek and I thought I heard a single knock  like someone hitting a bat against a tree.  I asked my wife if she heard it and she confirmed she heard the noise as well.  We thought maybe it came from hikers up ahead.  We walked along a little farther and heard what sounded like a tree fall in the distance behind us.  There was a little wind  and we have heard trees fall in the woods before  so we continued walking thinking nothing of it. We finished the Interpretive Trail Loop and decided to try another trail  this one called the Judge Branch Trail.  This trail parallels a creek and so we were just walking enjoying the woods when we came upon a muddy area with a lot of deer tracks. I used to hunt in my youth and love trying to discern what animals are doing or where they are going by their tracks.  It seemed to me that two or more deer had been fighting or struggling in the area right off the trail  you could see various hoof prints going in different directions and the ground was torn up.  Looking for more signs we came upon the footprint that was in much more solid ground.  My wife (who is a skeptic) agreed with me that it looked like a large bare footprint and you could definitely see what might be a big toe and maybe indentions of smaller toes.  The print was off the trail and was perpendicular to the trail. There were some leaves and small sticks on top of the imprint which makes me think that it was an older print.  I weigh more than 280lbs and my shoes did not leave marks next to the print which was about a quarter to half inch in depth.  Not too long after this the dogs seemed to become more fearful  and my wife felt the hairs on the back of her neck raise up.   She felt uncomfortable and so we decided to end the hike and head back to the car.  We decided to put the leashes back on the dogs and they pulled hard towards the car.  When they got to the parking lot they once more became relaxed and calm. Also  I could find no other tracks  but we did not venture far off the trail either.  I am not familiar with bears but could this have been a bear track?  I would love to know. ,It is in Frozen Head State Park  the trails have several camping areas.  We saw this print about 500ft or so after the camping area on this trail.  We saw no one else on this trail and I don  t think it had been used recently due to the amount of spider webs across the trail at the time. ,Morgan,17,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47129,no
3820,My husband and I were on our way home last fall and we saw what can only be described as a bigfoot walk across the road in front of us. It was a cold rainy night and we were on the back roads to our house and we rounded a curve and our head light hit it. It was in the middle of the road and then it just took one step and it was off the road. It was brownish grey in color and it was wet with rain looked like a long hair dog when wet. My husband and I looked at each other and said did you see that? ,Off of Hwy 27 north on Lee Pike going north where you get to fields on either side of the road. ,Hamilton,10,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47065,yes
3821,A friend and I decided to go hiking on the Fiery Gizzard trail in the Spring of 2000 or 2001.  We were hiking back to the trailhead through the gorge near the Fiery Gizzard creek when suddenly the woods literally erupted in the loudest screaming/whooping/whooing noise I have ever heard in my life.  There was definitely more than one of whatever was making this racket because I remember hearing screaming above the background of whooping and whooing sounds.  I remember thinking at the time that it sounded like one of the indian attack scenes in  The Last of the Mohicans  movie.  This went on for about 5 seconds and then complete silence.  I expected to hear someone laughing or running off but there was no sound of any kind.  I asked my friend  What the hell was that?   He said it was probably boy scouts.  There isn  t a boy scout alive with the lung capacity to make the noises we heard that day and we hadn  t seen many other people if any on the trail that day as I remember. Nothing else unusual occurred for the rest of the way out.  I have hiked this area many times since this incident with nothing unusual happening. , ,Grundy,5,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47061,no
3822,The weekend of the 11th and 12th I went on a day hike at Old Forge campground just inside Cherokee national Forest. The trail heads East up into the Appalachians. On the Round Knob trail I noticed a 13-14in print that looked very human like. I could only see 4 toes but it appeared there was probably also a fifth. There  s lots of moving water in the area  but I didn  t see much in the way of wildlife. The next weekend on the 18th I made another trip with a friend and walked the same trail. The print had been washed away so he didn  t get to see it. We got back to the campground and started a fire and just relaxed. At about 10 30pm we turned in. I couldn  t sleep very well  I fell in and out of consciousness all night. As I was laying in my tent listening to the snores and quiet I heard 2 wood knocks to the East and a few minutes later 1 wood knock from the West. I told my friend about it in the morning and suggested we come back and investigate another weekend. ,Drive through Greeneville on 11E headed East. Just past the Wal-Mart is Hwy. 107.

3823,My wife and I were returning home from a quick trip to the store. It was dark  about 10pm.  We live in a rural area  in Blaine  TN.  As we rounded a turn  almost to our house  my headlights caught the eyes of what I thought was an animal.  Then I noticed as we got closer that it was standing on two legs and was furry all over. It hopped a road-side barbed wire fence and disappeared into the night.  I stopped immediately  just past where it had jumped the fence.  I asked my wife if she saw it  but she was trying to get something out of the floor board. I got out but stayed by the vehicle  and looked out into the field but couldn  t see anything.  I do remember that its eyes caught light like an animals eyes  but I know from the shape and the way it jumped over the fence using its arms to lower the top wire that it was not a bear. The terrain was hilly area with wooded ridges and fields  and a river about 1/2 mile or so from the sighting area.  This occured in early April 2005. , ,Grainger,1,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47057,yes
3824,We were in the car heading back home (probably around 10 00 pm) when the sighting occurred. We were traveling east down US 64. There were high winds and my dad had trouble keeping the car on the road. We were driving along when we spotted something run across the road in front of us. It appeared to look like a bear  only more human features  but the rate at which it ran across the road made us believe it could not have been a bear. My dad (who has since passed away in 2002) and I are the only ones in the car who were able to spot what we believe was a bigfoot. My mother was in the car and looked down for a moment and missed what we saw. It happened so fast. The one thing I can remember is the bigfoot was searching for shelter quickly with the storm approaching. I could see that the bigfoot was fearful of the storm and was looking for shelter. It was one of the most unbelievable things I have ever witnessed. I have shared my story with friends and family for years. I believe I saw a bigfoot in the flesh to this day. It was amazing! ,Not sure exactly where on US 64 - somewhere between Pulaski and Fayetteville. There were woods to the right of the car where a bigfoot was running.

3825,I was 9 in 1974. I lived on the same farm land I live on now with my husband and 3 children. My older brother and I would take the trash off to the edge of the woods where there was an old oil drum and we would burn the garbage there. One late afternoon we rode our 3 wheeler called a scattracker down the hill to the burn site and started to burn the garbage. We were watching the garbage burn and I heard a loud growling noise and turned my head towards the right where the sound came from. I saw something in the shape of a man  black and hairy.It was walking into the edge of the woods just over a slight hill. I grabbed my brother and said   What was that?  He said  I don  t know but lets get the heck out of here and we jumped on the 3 wheeler and road back to the house as fast as we could. We had never heard of bigfoot or sasquatch so I told my parents I had seen a bear. My brother did not see as much of it as I had. I swore to them I was telling the truth. The coon dogs in the pen started throwing a fit  and they started to believe that I had seen something but were not sure as to what I had seen. I told them I would never forget what I saw and would hold to my story forever. Now I am 40 and I have told my children the story. Just this Saturday  my oldest son  came running to the house out of breath  saying he believed me because he saw it too in the edge of the woods past our back field. ,Withheld at witness request. ,Gibson,2,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47053,yes
3826,myself along with my two best friends went down to see some family in tennessee during the summer for a few days. while down there we usually take some time to do some small game hunting. on our second to last day there we went back for about a mile or two to try and find the property line since the man who owned the land was in poor health and couldnt do it himself. he hadnt been able to go back that far since about 15 years do to his condition. we noticed the deeper we went into the woods we saw no animals and that was interesting to us. later that night we were at a small pond with a bonfire when one of my friends decided he needed to go back to the house. we had heard something pacing back and forth on a hill behind us  but we figured it was probably just a coyote or fox so we didnt pay it too much attention. he had a remington 870 shotgun with 6 shells of buck shot loaded anyways for the half mile walk back to the house by himself  on the front of which he had mounted a flashlight. about two minuites after he left we heard him fire all six shots in rapid succession. once we got to him he was scared stiff. all he could say was that something was staring down at him and show us how far apart its eyes were. we didnt stick around long thinking that he may have just injured a bear so we ran back to the house. once we got there he told us that he turned a corner to see the eyes staring down at him just off the path.. he yeld at the animal twice and it didnt move  so he shot. the animal was about 10 feet away and still managed to run off. well he went to sleep in the house and his brother and i went to go bed down outside in the barn loft. i had just laid down in my sleeping bag when i heard the most terrifying scream i have ever heard to this day. this animal screamed for a solid 20 to 30 seconds on one breath. i could tell that it was coming from the area we had just been however it was so loud even still i get chills thinking about it. it only let out one scream and then stopped. but as soon as it did  the entire forest fell silent. the only sound heard was the horse that had been spooked running around its stable. i didnt get much sleep that night. the next morning we had to leave so we didnt have much time to investigate the spot in the daylight. however we did confirm the spot where he saw the animal with a steep incline about 15 feet off the trail. i found no shot impacts from the shotgun even searching the ground leading us all to believe that the animal had been shot. since it had rained the night before the ground was still wet and i couldnt find but maybe one spot of blood. we tried to track it but we didnt have time and the woods were so thick that it was difficult to find any prints. there was only one deep indent which may have been a print but we couldnt tell. all i know is that the animal was big and still ran off after being hit 6 times with buckshot from 10 feet away and still had enough air in its lungs to scream as loud as it did for that long. i know a lot about animals and the only thing that i know of that could be that big would be a bear  but even a healthy uninjured bear doesnt make the sound this animal did. so i dont know what it was for sure but the only thing that makes since is bigfoot. ,i dont know how to get there or any of the roads in the area. ,Fentress,1,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47049,no
3827,It was a Saturday morning in August  a friend and I were going hunting.  We were driving down Lanes Ferry Hwy about 5 00am when we came around a curve and some thing ran across the road in front of us in the headlights. I looked at my buddy and said  did you see that?  and he said  Yes  what was it?   I said it looked like a baby bigfoot. He said that  s what he thought also but wanted to make sure i did too. He was about 4 or 5 ft tall and you could see his arms swinging when he ran ran across the road from one cow pasture to the other headed towards the bluff and the river in the same direction as where we were going to hunt. ,near the cross on lanes ferry hwy of of 51 hwy ,Dyer,2,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47045,yes
3828,I was sitting in my mother  s kitchen with 2 of my nieces and my mother when I happened to look out of her back door. I clearly saw a very tall (approximately 7 feet) creature moving on two legs at an extremely rapid pace through the weeds bordering on her yard. I yelled  My God  what is that?  One of my nieces standing near the door whirled around and also saw the creature. After a few seconds of stunned silence we went into the back yard and saw the creature  now in the yard itself  dash behind a storage building. I remember being very afraid  as was everyone else  so we did not pursue whatever this was. As I said this creature was walking on 2 legs  was approximately 7 feet tall  covered with very dark brown or black hair. The creature was walking at a stunningly rapid pace with it  s shoulders hunched forward. As this thing was moving away from us we did not see any facial features but the head appeared rounded. We did not see this thing any more and assumed that it had stepped over a fence behind the storage building and preceded into the fields and woods. We were struck with how rapidly this thing was moving and were amazed that it had eluded us with such apparent ease. When first spotted the creature was approximately 80-100 feet from the back door. When observed in the yard itself it was approximately 150 feet away. We were too shaken to look for tracks and were actually afraid to go into the yard for a long time afterwards. ,This incident occurred approximately 4 miles east of Charlotte  Tennessee in Dickson County in what is known to locals as the Greenwood Community.

3829,I was born  raised  and currently live near Nashville  TN.  When I was about 13 years old  I had a 4-wheeler. My dad used to take me to a piece of property owned by one of his customers which is located in western Davidson County  about 10 miles directly west of downtown Nashville  on Hwy 70. Itâ€™s about 1 mile east of where Hwy 70 intersects Hwy 70 South. There I could ride my ATV and shoot guns. One afternoon  a couple hours before dark  in early October of 1988  I was riding my ATV on an old logging road  which ran along a creek  in the bottom of a holler (valley between two ridges). My 9 year-old stepbrother was on the back of the ATV  hanging on for dear life as I sped down the logging road at over 40 mph. He tucked his head between my shoulder blades as he sat behind me because he was apparently scared of my driving. The power company had bush-hogged or cut the brush in a 150 foot-wide path  centered on the power line  as per routine maintenance. The power line right-of-way had grown up really thick since the last cutting  which mustâ€™ve been 2 years prior to this. Just before the old logging road passed under the power line  there was a â€œdog-legâ€ in the road (the road went straight  made a quick 20 degree turn to the right  and immediately turned another 20 degrees back to the left  now running in the same direction as it was originally  just 3-4 feet to the right of the original vector). I had fun seeing how fast I could drive through the â€œdog-legâ€ and also scaring my younger stepbrother. On this particular day  I got up to speed  fishtailed through the â€œdog-leg â€ and proceeded to drive past the thick overgrowth  approximately 8-10 feet high  which ran under the power line. At this point  I saw something that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up! From the brush on the left side of the road  something ran out in front of me. It was covered in 5-8 inch long dark brown hair  about 7.5-8.5 feet tall  and was running on two legs! It passed right in front of me with lightening speed. Iâ€™d say it only took about 2 steps to clear the 12-foot wide logging road. It then disappeared into the overgrowth on the right side of the logging road. I didnâ€™t get a really clear look at the creature because it happened so fast. I didnâ€™t stop either. Out of fear  I applied full throttle to the ATV in an attempt to vacate the area. My stepbrother didnâ€™t see a thing because he was hiding in fear of my reckless driving. I yelled out to him to see if heâ€™d seen the creature but he thought I was joking. The best description I can give of the way I felt after the incident would be to compare it to having a near miss in a fatal automobile crash! My heart just felt like it stopped before it began to beat out of my chest. Nearly an hour passed before I found the courage to return to the location of the sighting. I had to go back through the location because it was the only way back to my dadâ€™s truck. The first time I drove back through  I was travelling at a high rate of speed due to fear. Curiosity eventually got the best of me and I returned  still on my ATV  just as it was getting dark. I found no tracks (it was extremely dry at the time)  smelled nothing out of the ordinary  and saw only a path through the brush  which appeared to be seldom used. I didnâ€™t say a word to my dad about what Iâ€™d seen when he asked why Iâ€™d been gone for so long. If I had  he wouldâ€™ve thought I was out of my mind. I didnâ€™t tell anyone for a long time. To this day  the event plays over in my mind like a movie. ,Take Charlotte Pike/HWY 70 westbound out of Nashville toward Memphis. Drive approximately 10 or 15 miles.

3830,While home from college on holiday break I was out visiting friends one night.  I had pulled over and was outside the car in a remote area near my home (parents home) with a friend.  While outside the car  some movement caught my eye on a rock cliff on the opposite side of the road and approx. 100   away.  I saw a figure approx. 7   tall  broad from shoulders down through torso  large head  covered entirely with dark (hair)  standing upright with arms straight down by side.  No eyes  mouth  ears noticeable.  I stood still for 10-15 seconds starring at the image; then  it turned to it  s left and disappeared.  No sounds made.  I hurried my friend back into the car and asked him if he saw what I saw and he said he only got a brief glimpse of a shadowy movement.  Although I definitely saw as described  I have dismissed this as being a person  maybe a hunter in the area.  And  I was looking upward at the time so the image could have been distorted.  But  readings of other similar sightings since has prompted me to submit this occurrence. ,Approx. 2 miles south of 369 (street address)  home address of parents. ,Cumberland,5,Tennessee ,TN,Winter ,47035,yes
3831,It was late April  1994  my dad borrowed my fishing boat and went down Cypress Creek to his favorite fishing hole to try to catch a few fish. It had been a long winter and it was the first time since he had broken his hip during the ice storm that he felt like being out in nature. My dad was very comfortable in the woods and on the water for he spent all his free time there. He had lived in this area all his life. Later that evening around 9 pm my mother called she was worried that my dad hadnâ€™t come home yet. It was not unusual for him to stay out late in the woods or on the water  on numerous occasions in the past  I have had to go find him to tell him supperâ€™s ready to get him home  but on this night I to had a bad feeling about him not being home yet. I got one of my friends to go with me to look for him. It was windy and dark so we took our flashlights and headed out. Dadâ€™s favorite fishing spot was about a mile off of the highway right before Cypress Creek dumped into the Forked Deer River. The only way there is by boat or to hike. We went down the east side of the creek  shinning our flashlights and yelling for my dad. As we approached the area where my dad like to fish we heard a clicking sound like an insect  but not like any insect I had ever heard. So we stopped and looked around when we spotted on the North bank of the Forked Deer River two sets of large red eyes. This  of course  freaked us out. We started flashing the lights around and we spotted the boat on the other side of the creek but it was too deep and wide to cross so we had no choice but to go back to the highway and cross on the road and run back down the other side of the creek back to the boat. As we got back to the road my mother had called one of our cousins to help look for my dad. We told him we found him to go back to the house and call Rescue to meet us at the bridge. So we proceeded to run back down the west side of the creek to the spot the boat was. We found my dad floating beside the boat with the boat rope wrapped around his hand. The red eyes were still on the North bank of the Forked Deer River  as if they were keeping watch on my Dad. We were able to get him in the boat and perform CPR but unfortunately he had already died. So  of course  we were in a heighten state of emotions but we were trying to get my dad back to the Rescue unit waiting at the bridge on the highway. As we started paddling we were hitting something under the water but that couldnâ€™t be that for the creek was about 20 ft deep.  We didnâ€™t know or understand how or who had taken my dadâ€™s life and it was as if they were after us as well. I kept yelling  â€œCome on you SOB  you got him but youâ€™re not going to get me. Iâ€™m not afraid of youâ€. Once we got several yards upstream we were able to paddle without resistance. We finally got back to the bridge where Rescue was waiting. We found out later by the Medical Examiner that my Dad had suffered a massive heart attack. Over the years I often wondered if the Creatures with large red eyes were keeping protective watch over my dad. I know with as much time  day and night  that my dad spent in those woods and on the water they knew him and they were trying to protect him in his time of need. The clicking sound was alerting me that my dad was near. Another thing  why didnâ€™t the boat and my dad float off  the creek and the river has a current and thereâ€™s no telling how long it stayed in that spot without floating off  it was not tied off. After many years I finally went back during the daylight to the spot where my Dad died. I got a better reference to where the eyes were and I can tell you this  I couldnâ€™t tell exactly how tall they were but after seeing the area in daylight the Creatures were very large. I know this is a very personal incident to be telling but I thought it had to be told. I feel that the creatures in no way did anything to harm my dad. I feel grateful for the creatures I encountered that night for without them I would not have found my Dad a fast as I did. I just wish the outcome would have been different. ,Cypress Creek  Hwy 152 where the creek dumps into Forked Deer River ,Crockett,1,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47033,yes
3832,I was pulling out of my driveway getting ready to leave for work as I looked to the left I noticed movement on the embankment by the road. I sat watched for a little while and a very very large dark cone headed type person animal whatever you want to call it took a step and was in the middle of the road.  It just stood there like it was watching me watching it. It stood there for a few mins and turned and walked across the street into underbrush and trees over by the creek.  I waited a little longer and it never came back out so I went to work.  This started a sort of strange animals being seen around here and heard.  My father claimed to keep seeing a very large brownish black bear across the street. The next door neighbors grandson was playing in the back yard and came around front and told us there was a big gorilla in the backyard.  The sound I have heard at night is a cross between a scream  howl and growl and some nights you can smell a very heavy wet  dog smell with a hint of mildew mixed in. ,Woods on one side of the road creek and woods on the other side of road go forever they do have caves and sink holes and hidden places plus deer squirrel rabbit wild turkey.

3833,I heard 2 distinct wood knocks in am area that I had hunted for 7 years. I sit on the ground at the exact same spot every year. It was the saturday after thanksgiving around 9am sunny and around 45 degrees. The area is very active with wild life  deer  turkey  squirrels  and birds. I sit in the same spot on the ground every year. It is on the side of a ridge overlooking a creek. Everything got eerilly quiet no birds singing no squirrels playing and calling. I had just noticed how quiet it was when I heard 2 knocks to my right. Back up the creek I was over looking. While trying to figure out what I heard there came a response to my left very faint and far away. It freeked me out and I realized that I was sitting at a natural intersection. I didn  t want to see what was making all the noise. So I left the area rather quickly. ,Very end of the main road leading thru the WMA property This is the only WMA property in the county. ,Cheatham,1,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47021,yes
3834,august 1984  When I was about 15  3 of my friends and I were camping in the woods above my house we had two dogs a collie and a female husky. we had built a leanto to sleep under. We were just talking about things girls and such when one of my friends let us know that he heard something we just laughed at him  about 2 or three minutes later 2 of my friends claimed to have heard the same noise so the two of us that did not here it started making fun of them. about 5 minutes after that our dogs started pacing back and forth and acting strange. then all at once a loud yell came from behind the leanto and it shook hard i could see it visably shaking we all ran except for one and he froze and could not move. we ran through the pitch black woods hitting trees and running through briars. when we got out of the woods we turned and noticed that our friend was not with us we yelled for him and about 2 minutes later he came out of the woods carrying his collie in his arms. I never knew what this thing was but my friend said that he could not see it but that he could here it behind him making a grunting sound as he sat in front of the fire and he could hear it behind him walking as he walked out of the woods some distance behind him. we went back the next day with an adult to retrieve our sleeping bags and things and our leanto had been torn down the rocks we had for the fire pit was scattered.the whole area smelled 10 X  s worse than a wet dog.(when this thing yelled from behind our leanto it was super loud as if someone had loud speakers behind our leanto) ,about 1/2 mile off long hollow rd and 1/2 mile east greenacers subdivsion. ,Carter,4,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47019,no
3835,OBSERVED  My great aunt  Ida Jones told me that when she was young (about 1905) she and her brother and sister were walking home one night from a party when they saw a thing sitting out in the field beside the road.  She said it looked like a man but was covered with dark hair.  She said she could see the moon reflected in its eyes (which implies that the eyes were set in front  not on the side like a bear  s).  I made no noise but it watched them  turning it  s head as the passed.  The three walked home arm in arm with one walking backward to see if the thing was following them. ,LOCATION  Carroll Co.

3836,As two witnesses were hunting  they became aware of something noisily making its way through some brush about 50 yards away. Thinking it too large to be a deer  both witnesses simultaneously viewed from their tree stands a large  hairy  7 ft. tall creature walking across an old logging trail (this only totally clear area near them) before they could do anything. The creature suddenly tore through the forest away from the hunters. (The witnesses believe that it possibly smelled them and became spooked.) It was too dark by the time the witnesses got out of their tree stands to find any footprints  but they did observe damaged undergrowth. ,Short Mountain ,Cannon,2,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47015,yes

3838,It was late fall shortly after sundown  my girlfriend and I went for a walk down the road that ran infront of her house. The weather was cool and the sky was clear. We walked with the shoulder of the road to our right. Slighty off the road  there was a fence row about 6 feet above the level of the road. As we were walking along the road  I heard something   tramping   around on the fence row. We got spooked. It noise continued. I just had to know what it was so I jumped up on the fence row and looked across a cut corn field. As I looked across the field  I noticed something walking along a ditch. It appeared to be tall and slender with a shaggy brown skin. I hollared at it and it stepped off into a ditch bank. We got scared and ran back to my girlfriends house. The next day  I went back and search through the corn field. I found several large footprints in some left over lime. They were slightly larger than my 12 shoe and appeared to be a barefoot human  except bigger. A few weeks later  my girlfriend was walking around a pond near an old homeplace. We heard something walking through the woods. It didn  t sound like a deer or a man. It sounded different. We stayed a few minutes listening to this   something   walk through the woods. Feeling kinda on edge  we left. Over the next few weeks  I kept an eye out for anything unusual  but didn  t find anything. ,Take Hwy 124 West from McKenzie  turn left on Hwy 190 S about 3 miles. ,Carroll,15,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47017,yes
3839,My wife was going to work around the end of july 2002 and saw something by the side of the road. It was tall and dark colored. She slowed down because she thought it was someone who might have broken down. The thing was at the edge of the road near a creek. As she stopped it crossed the road and leaped onto a dirt bank about 5 or 6 feet off the road and went into the woods. A day or two later as she was going to work she saw something standing by the edge of the road in the same area. It was tall and dark with reddish eyes. It made no effort to come into the road and went back into the woods. All of these events occured during the early morning hours on a remote section of mountanous road in the Stoney Creek section of Carter county on Highway 91. On August 1 2002 at 0300 hours I was letting my dog out of the house because I thought he had to go to the bathroom. My female dog would not leave the house and my male dog went onto the porch and stared at a field adjacent to my house. He would not leave the porch and his ruff was up and he would growl low. I looked around and saw something in the field about 2 o  clock from my elevated position. I could not get a direct look at what it was but it was large enough to be seen bent over in a field of nearly mature untopped tobacco. When it realized it was spotted it made a chuffing noise  between a growl and a guttural throat sound. At this time I noticed another figure in the field moving off into a shadowy area between a barn and a road behind my location. This was a smaller version of what was in the field near me. The thing in the field from me stayed until the thing that had crossed the road made a similar chuffing sound. The dogs behind my location and in the area where this happened were barking. The thing in the field then began to move through the tobacco field to the tall grass and the tree line. I also heard a noise like something in pain  something small. This was follwed by two additional series of sounds (the chuffing) coming from an area near a creek across the road from us. this was answered by the things that had crossed through the field at my location. The only look I got at the thing was a rounded back covered with a brownsih red or light brown fur. This again happened at night and the light was not bad. There was a partial moon and ambient light from property nearby. ,This was in Carter County in the NE corner of the state.

3840,I live in a retirement community known as Fairfield Glade on the Cumberland Plateau in East Tennessee. Knoxville is the nearest large city and is 65 miles east.  Our little community is surrounded on almost three sides by a state forest and the Catoosa Wildlife Refuge.  We have an over abundance of  protected  wildlife of all kinds (including too many deer  in my opinion) that venture  at will  into our community.  Always the bold tomboy  I preferred to get my exercise by hiking the heavily forested back roads and trails near our home instead of playing golf as my husband did.  I never hiked more than 6 miles from home  and always in the early morning.  One morning  I was approximately 4 miles from my home when I came upon an unexpected sunny clearing that seemed to have been an old road or path at one time because it was grassy and void of underbrush or trees.  On my hikes I am normally under a full canopy of very tall trees.  So the sunlight was an unexpected pleasure.  As I rounded a curve and my eyes caught the filtered sunlight from the clearing  I observed a large ape-like creature jump from the woods and pounce at something on the ground.  I abruptly froze.  In a flash  the creature stood back up holding a long snake by the head.  Just as quick as this happened  the creature disappeared back into the cover of the woods alongside the clearing.  I remained still for a moment contemplating whether the animal had seen me and how best to protect myself.  I literally heard my heart beating.  I quickly ruled out tree climbing and decided the only alternative was to turn in the opposite direction and run as fast as my legs would carry me. I ran nearly all the way home.  I was so disturbed by what I had seen  I decided that no one would believe it  so I never told anyone.  That was about 5 or 6 years ago  and my husband has since died. Over the years  I have tried to convince myself that I really didn  t see the thing that has so frightened me that morning in the woods.  I tried to convince myself that I had somehow imagined it; however  the vivid memory persists.  To this day  I have never set foot in any woods again  essentially breaking a very longstanding and much revered habit that day.  I am still fearful of seeing that creature again.  I have always been a sober-minded individual  not at all given to making up fantasies or stretching the truth as I know it.  I was completely caught off guard and stunned the other day when an ad spot for your show came across my TV screen. After watching your show  I am now convinced that I actually did see what I thought I saw that day on my last hike. Your show also brought to mind the night a few years ago.  This happened well after my experience in the woods.  My husband and I were sitting on our deck looking up at the stars  so clearly visible up here on a clear night in the dark woods of the Cumberland Plateau.  We were quietly listening for the Whipoorwill who nests every year in the woods across our street.  He calls relentlessly for a mate every night during season.  Piercing through the peace and tranquility we heard the most horrific deep bellowing scream from what seemed like some distance away.  We had both been leaning way back in our lawn chairs admiring the night sky  and almost fell out of our chairs in shock.  I remember my husband abruptly stood up and said we should go inside and he added that he had never seen a mountain lion big enough to scream like that.  I did not make the mental connection to the scream we heard and the creature I had seen a few years prior until I saw your show and heard your team members calling out to bigfoot.  Oh my gosh!  That was the same sound!  I must confess that I am a reluctant convert! ,It was within a few miles of the community stables and Dorcester Golf Course  roughly between Fairfield Glade (Peavine Rd)  I-40  and the village of Crab Orchard  but beyond the FFG subdivisions. ,Cumberland,5,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47035,yes
3841,I was walking in a field located at the base of Black Mountain  Crab Orchard  TN.  I had my wife and 2 daughters. As I walked I could sense apprehension from my girls and could feel myself. Feeling that this is from their usual fear of bears I continued the walk. As we made our way around the end of the field I looked up to notice a large black creature jump into the wood line. I looked back at my wife and the words I spoke were â€œThat was bigâ€ ...   I keep wanting to say it was a wild boar or maybe even bear. That would be fine but it walked on 2 legs and had a backside of a human or ape. And also moved like a bipedal creature. ,Base of Black Mountain ,Cumberland,5,Tennessee ,TN,Spring ,47035,yes
3842,I was sitting in my mother  s kitchen with 2 of my nieces and my mother when I happened to look out of her back door. I clearly saw a very tall (approximately 7 feet) creature moving on two legs at an extremely rapid pace through the weeds bordering on her yard. I yelled  My God  what is that?  One of my nieces standing near the door whirled around and also saw the creature. After a few seconds of stunned silence we went into the back yard and saw the creature  now in the yard itself  dash behind a storage building. I remember being very afraid  as was everyone else  so we did not pursue whatever this was. As I said this creature was walking on 2 legs  was approximately 7 feet tall  covered with very dark brown or black hair. The creature was walking at a stunningly rapid pace with it  s shoulders hunched forward. As this thing was moving away from us we did not see any facial features but the head appeared rounded. We did not see this thing any more and assumed that it had stepped over a fence behind the storage building and preceded into the fields and woods. We were struck with how rapidly this thing was moving and were amazed that it had eluded us with such apparent ease. When first spotted the creature was approximately 80-100 feet from the back door. When observed in the yard itself it was approximately 150 feet away. We were too shaken to look for tracks and were actually afraid to go into the yard for a long time afterwards. ,This incident occurred approximately 4 miles east of Charlotte  Tennessee in Dickson County in what is known to locals as the Greenwood Community.

3843,Ruskin Cave was a recreational park at the time and we were living there to work.  My daughter was followed home late one night. A bigfoot came up behind her and tried to take a large bag of candy from her.  It bruised her back. She came home literally in shock and could not even describe the incident for minutes.  While she was trying to describe it to me  I looked out our window and it was standing outside staring in at me.  I almost blacked out.  It was the size of it that shook me  as well as the look  and nearness of this creature  standing there outside our window looking in at me.  Several other people on the property heard its screams throughout that summer all over that property. It would make your hair stand up on your head and paralyze you for seconds when you heard it.

3844,I was out frog gigging. It was late I`d say around ten thirty at night. I was headed home. I remember it was really dark that night because there was no moon. To get home I had to walk along a ridge down a tractor path  the path went straight to our house. There was a gap at the edge of the woods line and I had cross a barbwire fence. As I neared this gap I was starteld by something getting up from the ground not 12 ft away from me. At first I thought it might be one of my grandpas cows  but cows don`t stand on two legs. It was black and tall maybe 7.5 to 8 ft tall. This encounter lasted maybe ten seconds max  I`ve hunted all my life and never seen anything like that. It scared the fool out of me  it stood up and looked at me and I just stood there and looked at it. Then it turned and took of down into the woods. It swung its arms like a man and I could hear wide bipedal steps. I never smelled it  and it never made a sound. All I could hear was it moveing very fast away from me. I run home as fast as I could scared to death. I told my mother what I had seen and she told me I was crazy. I never told anyone else what I saw that night but my wife and she believes me. I had herd weired screams at night and once during the day close to the house and it made the hair on my neck stand on end. But I haven`t heard anything there in a long long time.

3845,I was driving on Highway 104 between Trenton Tn and Dyersburg Tn . We were headed home. There is a large wooded area as you are in Dyer county and Gibson county . I look to my left glancing at the woods just before the river. I did a double take. Told my wife and my son   You wont believe what I just saw!  I estimate it to be about 7-8 ft in high.

3846,This happened on my grandparent  s farm  which they still live on and I still visit almost weekly. I was probably 12 at the time and it was the summer so my grandparents would allow my sister (10 at the time) and I to have sleepovers at their house. There were probably 7 of us staying over that night and we had been outside all day and were all from the area. For a little background on the location of the sighting my grandparents house is situated between two small towns with populations of around 1000 each. The farm is also about 10 minutes from 3 different wildlife areas. They had no neighbors at the time other than cows and corn. Now they have one neighbor whose house you can see from the yard but no other visible neighbors. Around 11pm we decided to go outside because we were being loud and my grandparents had gone to bed. We had done this probably a half dozen of times over the summer. We had been outside for probably 30 minutes to an hour when we started to hear odd noises in the cornfield across the road and the sound of corn stalks breaking. This continued over the next probably 20-30 minutes. As a bunch of 10-12 year old girls we ignored the sounds and kept talking all the while my grandparents 3 dogs were sitting in front of us tails tucked growling like something was in the cornfield that was maybe 50 yards from where we were sitting in my grandparents front yard. We heard a loud scream from the cornfield as something came out of the field right in front of us. What came out of the field was a tall humanoid creature covered in dark brown hair that was slightly taller than the corn was at the time at about 6-7 feet. We all looked at the creature and took off running back towards the house leaving all of our things outside. Once we got inside we looked at each other in utter shock at what we had seen. None of us wanted to say anything to my grandparent because we all thought they would call us crazy. Of the seven of us that saw the creatures 4 of us had been raised hunting and fishing. We knew the animals native to the area and spent hours in the woods in with our fathers and grandfathers learning how to track animals and respect nature. To this day I am afraid to be outside at their house at night by myself. I have heard the same noises again and again over the years including the screams and wood knocks. ,[Directions removed at request of witness.

3847,at 2 30 a.m. on wednesday september the 1 2004 my brother called me on the telephone and told me that he had been outside to hook a car trailer to his truck. he said he went in the house to get a flashlight and when he came back outside he heard a noise so he shined the light up into the woods to look around  and as he came around with the light something reflected the beam and when he came back to the spot of the reflection in the grass just on the other side of his truck there was a creature that looked like a man covered in long shiny black hair with eyes about the size of a horses. it was squatting down with its arms around its knees just staring at him and when the light hit it in the eyes it just turned its head away. that is when he went in to call me. while we were on the phone he opened the door to see if it was still there and you could hear it running through the woods yelling. the reason i am on this sight is to see if we can get some help and some answers. , ,Giles,6,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47055,yes
3848,Driving down S. 75 with my family and brother in law in seperate trucks going through Tennessee to Georgia. The road was 2 lanes and N. bound lane seemed to be 200 yds. away from us. With my bright lights on and in left lane I noticed a very large object on the left side of road. As we got closer to what I thought was a bear  turned out to be a bigfoot. When we got to within 75 yds. I could see it crouched over a dead animal. As we were about to pass it  it turned and looked right at us. I freaked out and called carl on the phone to ask him   did u see what I just did  ? He did. Been very scared to tell anyone  cause people will think we are nuts. We know what we saw. ,Atleast 1 hr. to Georgia. ,Bradley,2,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47011,yes
3849,It was unusually warm to be mid-December on this day and me and my buddy was hunting in a area known as Chilhowee. It was about a hour before sunset when we climbed out of our deer stands. I met my buddy in a little holler about 100 yards from both of our tree stands. We were walking back to the 4 wheeler when we heard a very low rumble in the holler we had just met in. We were now at this time about 35 yards from the holler almost in a field  so we thought we would be real still and sit on the edge of the field for a minute and see if we could hear anything else. At this time we were thinking it was just a grunt or a blow from a deer that we had scared. We wated probally 10 minutes before we heard a loud splash in a little drinking hole  me and my buddy looked at each other and said what the hell is that. So we wated another minute  still hoping that a deer would come out then we heard a second splash. At this time we realized it wasnâ€™t a deer. so we walked probally 20 yards and saw what we believe is a bigfoot. It was aproximately 7 to 8 feet tall and I would say weighed 300-350 pounds just guessing.  Me and my friend were almost in shock at what we had scene. The bigfoot saw us and actually didnâ€™t seem to care that we were watching it.  He kind of just lingered around the area for another minute before walking over a small ridge where we lost sight of it and to be honest we were to scared to go and look for it so we went back to the house and told everybody there  but they said we were crazy and it was just a bear. I have been hunting bear for years and I am familiar with their movements.  This was no bear.  I know this because it never dropped down on all four of its feet the whole time we watched it and we probally saw it walk a total of only 30-40 yards but I am 100 % sure it was no bear.  It was some sort of human ape creature I am positive it was a sasquatch and so is my buddy. ,South of Maryville  TN about 20 miles from the N.C. line. ,Blount,4,Tennessee ,TN,Winter ,47009,yes
3850,I was coming back from fishing at Big Ridge State Park with my mom  dad and small son. We were walking along a trail that led from the lake we were fishing at to the parking lot through the woods. My son and I were in front of my mom and dad and I had turned my head around to tell them something and when I turned back around there it was. It was about 20-25 feet in front of my son and I. It looked to be about 8-9 feet tall. I didn  t see a neck on it and it looked straight ahead of it. It swung its arms when it walked and its strides were about 4-6 feet long. The trail itself was about 4 or 5 feet across. It was walking at about 5 mph. It was black with some brown mixed in. It walked very stiffly and the terrain it went on after walking in front of us was flat but thick with bushes and trees and I couldn  t see it anymore. I gasped and turned around real fast and told my mom and dad that I had just seen bigfoot. We did not go look for tracks because it was just getting dark and we kept walking. We didn  t hear any sounds after the encounter. It went so fast I just got a glimpse. I know it wasn  t a human. ,Off of highway 61 in Big Ridge State Park. ,Anderson,10,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47001,yes
3851,Well  me blake and richie were camping out back in the woods.  When we heard a terrible moan. Then we heard it moan again  and we heard it begin to run towards us on two feet.  We jumped back from the fire and turned on the lights on the truck. As the lights shined down the hollow that night  I saw something I hope to never see again.  It was around 6 feet tall  long arms  and dark hair covered its body.  We were about 20 yards from it.  I looked at it for about 10 more seconds before we jumped in the truck and drove off as fast as we could.  I can assure you that this is no hoax.

3852,On March 3rd  2012 something happened to me and a buddy that we canâ€™t explain. I hadn  t really thought about whether or not I believed in Bigfoot as a Biology student  but whatever this was made a believer of me. Basically  it scared the hell out of us. Me and Clay have grown up in the Norris Lake area.  Weâ€™re hunters  fishermen  backpackers  and general outdoorsmen and weâ€™ve never encountered anything like this. Earlier that day we had decided to take my four wheeler up the lake approximately five miles from my house to a clearing and build a fire.  We got to the clearing around 9 30.  We kept hearing two owls hoot at each other from across the lake and we both kept hearing something moving in the tree line sixty yards from our fire.  We quickly dismissed the footsteps as being a deer and as the night progressed the wind started to blow really hard. At 11 pm the wind started to die down a little bit and I noticed that the woods were totally silent.  The owls had stopped hooting and the water wasnâ€™t white capping anymore.  Around midnight we decided to leave and as we stood up we heard these sounds in the woods like sticks breaking.  We knew that if it were a deer we would have spooked it a long time ago.  I felt eyes on me and for some reason I had this random notion to make a wood knock.  I had seen the Finding Bigfoot show and thought maybe I can get a response out of whatever was in the woods.  I picked up a piece of cedar from the wood pile and knocked it against a cypress tree.  We waited for the echoes to clear and while I didnâ€™t hear anything Clay stood straight up and started breathing heavy saying he heard a knock back.  I thought he was lying  but soon after became a believer.  I knocked again and this time I heard three distinctive knocks back.  Thereâ€™s no way it could have been an echo because the reply came long after the echoes cleared.  I suddenly got scared- like shaking.  I knocked again and let out a â€œwhoopingâ€ call.  We got one distinctive knock back and then we heard this growlâ€¦ this horrible growl.  It was guttural and yet somehow primate like.  It was like a monkey whooping and a deep snarl at the same timeâ€”almost like whatever made it was using two sets of vocal chords. We started freaking out  but we really wanted to figure out what it was  so we jumped on my four wheeler and rode towards the sound.  We stopped periodically  but never heard anything.  What was strange was that we both felt strongly like something was watching us.   I mean that feeling alone was terrifying because it just felt like pure hatred.  We ended up riding back to my house without actually seeing the creature  but whatever it was- it was angry that we were there and it absolutely hated us.  True story- no joke whatsoever. ,The location was where Mill Creek enters Norris Lake.  There is a rock outcropping and a swampy area. ,Anderson,10,Tennessee ,TN,Winter ,47001,no
3853,my wife and i were talking to her brother and his girlfriend on the back porch of my in-laws. My wife and i were facing the house and my brother-in-law and girlfriend were facing us. In the midst of our conversation  we heard a loud scream. Growing up in the country and raised on a farm  i have heard most of the common North American animal calls.  I have NEVER heard anything that screamed like this. We had about 300 yards of field and yards before it turned to woods. We didnt see it  but it sounded almost as if it were just behind us. At the same time  there was another approx. 1/2 mile down the road and they were yelling back and forth as if they were talking. The lungs on these creatures were amazing! ,From Cleveland  go down Spring Place road to Keith Valley.

3854,Let me first say I  m glad you folks are out there and believe as truly as I do that bigfoot is real. Back in the summer of 1995 myself and four friends were camping at the base of a mountain in our town in east TN. Normal night with our friends until the campfire died down. We were on an old road bed and had been breaking all kinds of dead trees for a fire and as we were doing this a lost hunting dog came up to us. When it did we gave it some peanut butter and the poor starving thing ate some then carried of the plastic jar we didn  t think anything else of him until a few hours later. The fire started dieing down and me and 3 of my friends were sitting leaning against the embankment as the dog came running back to us shivering. We were all kinda like what the hell  I  m getting chills as i type this  we were looking in the direction where the dog cam from and we saw a large  dark shadow just out of the light  just out of our clear vision from the fire. Me and my friends froze. The dog was whimpering and that  s not normal for a coon dog. We saw the shadow turn towards us and all we saw were the reflection of its eyes. It paused to look for all of 45 seconds and then  like it was shot out of a cannon this loud sound like it was running through the woods  breaking trees at this point. Fear had overwhelmed all of us. We had been in this area of the woods many times over the years we built the fire as large as we could and none of us slept the rest of the night. When we saw what we considered to be a bigfoot there was this terrible wet animal smell that was unmistakable. To this day I  ve never smelled an animal like it since. Approximately 3 or 4 years later me and one of the guys were at the top of the mountain not far from there at a large natural sand cave and a large waterfall. We got bored as people that age do and and went on top of the sand cave to sit at the edge of the waterfall. As we climbed up to the top we had that same smell hit us and the same type of destruction was present. Trees about 3.5 to 4 feet up were just broken off like the first time we encountered this. We looked around and followed the path as far as we could until it ran out. We all still talk about this to this day and we all get cold chills when we do. I  d love to be able to speak with one of you or all. If you think this is worth your time  me and those guys would be willing to speak to you about this. ,Travel from Knoxville TN north on I-75  take exit 134  go right continue east on highway 63 approximately 15 miles on the left side of the highway at the large bend in the mountain ,Campbell,2,Tennessee ,TN,Summer ,47013,yes
3855,UT Vet  Primate Not Killing Cats As WVLT VOLUNTEER TV News first reported last week  there is some monkey business going on in Campbell County. Some people there said they have seen a primate terrorizing residents and pets. Campbell County  s 911 center has been receiving calls about the creature for weeks.  They  re saying it  s a chimpanzee  a large chimpanzee   said 911 dispatcher Kamille Barnes.  It  s killing their cats.  Barnes lives in the College Hill community  which is where the creature has been sighted. She believes it came into her house.  My basement door was left open  and something came in and scattered all the clothes and stuff stored in the basement   she said. UT Veterinary School primate expert Dr. Edward Ramsey said the creature that is making its presence known in Campbell County is likely not a chimpanzee like those found at the Knoxville Zoo.  Chimps are really rare as private pets  so chances that this is a chimp are pretty remote   he said. He did say it may very well be some type of monkey.  There are unfortunately still a fair number of monkeys still in private hands   he said.  We  ve had one or two times [that] an animal escaped from a private zoo in Pigeon Forge.  Ramsey said that whatever kind of primate it may be  he does not believe it  s responsible for the recent pet deaths in the area.  Odds are  if it killed anything  I don  t think it would kill many and it wouldn  t kill repeatedly. Virtually every primate is herbivorous.  He said that if a monkey is on the loose  it  s a perfect example of why most exotic animals don  t make good pets.  We don  t think it  s appropriate for people to keep -- specifically -- macaques as pets because of the ability to carry fatal disease   he said.  They  re not trainable in the traditional animal sense of the term.  LaFollette animal control is investigating the situation. Knoxville Zoo officials said if the animal is caught  the zoo likely would not be able to take it  and it may have to be euthanized. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - October 20  2003 By VINCE LENNON 6 News Reporter JACKSBORO (WATE) -- Animal control officers in Campbell County are searching for a primate  perhaps weighing 400 pounds  that  s on the loose. And nearly 100 pets are missing.  I didn  t really get a good look at his face because he didn  t hang around all that long   Donna Keathley said about when she saw an ape-like creature last week in LaFollette.  But he  s big and he  s got a really bad stinkful odor to him.  LaFollette Animal Control Officer George Moses said   I believe that the people believe that they see it. I don  t have any reason to doubt them  that they  re mistaken.  Moses said he hasn  t seen the animal but he  s certainly heard of it. He started getting calls about it three weeks ago. All the alleged sightings center on the College Hill community  just outside the LaFollette city limits. Coinciding with the sightings are numerous reports of missing cats and kittens.  All told  over 100  are missing  Moses said. According to Donna Keathley  when she startled the animal   This kitten he threw at me  no one knows where it come from.  One College Hill man  who declined to be identified  claims the primate is an orangutan. He said he saw it Tuesday morning leaving stool samples on his property. Many College Hill residents believe the animal escaped a circus that performed at the nearby National Guard armory a few months back. But the LaFollette Police Department and the Campbell County Sheriff  s Department didn  t take any reports of a missing animal. Donna Keathley said her neighbors are ready to shoot the animal.  If I had a gun  I would  ve shot it.  Several people told 6 News Monday that they want the animal caught or killed before Halloween so it can  t attack a child or another pet. Campbell County officers warn anyone who sees the animal not to attempt capturing it. It  s considered dangerous. Instead  any sighting should be reported immediately to LaFollette Animal Control at (423)-566-1383  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Is a Skunk Ape Loose in Campbell County? MORE ON WATE.com Campbell Co. Sheriff  s Dept. Opens Investigation of Possible Primate October 22  2003 By VINCE LENNON 6 News Reporter CAMPBELL COUNTY (WATE) -- A new theory emerged Wednesday as a crypto- zoologist weighed in on sightings of a possible primate in Campbell County. A Crypto-zoologist  someone who studies uncataloged animals such as skunk apes  accompanied a 6 News crew in Campbell County Wednesday. Myakka  skunk apes  have been spotted in the southeastern United States since the 1940  s. Local crypto-zoologist Chris Dotson contacted 6 News after seeing the stories on Campbell County primate sightings.  The animal people reported seeing is not a pet.  Dotson took the skunk ape photographs Wednesday to people who  ve claimed to have seen the primate in the LaFollette area. Dotson  s convinced that what people are seeing is a skunk ape.  We need to capture this thing the best we can   Dotson said.  People need to stay away from it  allow experts to come in who have some knowledge of large primates like this and trap this animal.  Monkey owner Jerome Love answered a summons at the Campbell County Sheriff  s Department with his Macaque monkey  Mugway.  Love wanted to prove it  s not his animal that  s loose.  If it  s a monkey that  s killing these cats  it  s not this one and I  m tired of it.  6 News is hearing more accounts from Campbell County residents who say they  ve seen the creature. Some date back 35 years. However  many people are hesitant to talk  for fear of being labeled as crazy. In all  six cats and one dog have been killed in the last three days. And there have been a number of sightings within the last 48 hours. The warning still stands though for people not to try approaching the animal  but to report it to local authorities. Crypto-zoologists believe there could be hundreds of skunk apes across the Southeast. ,N/A  at this time  check newspaper updates. ,Campbell,2,Tennessee ,TN,Fall ,47013,yes
4146,My family and I went to Ludlow  Vermont for Columbus Day weekend since we enjoy the northeastern woods. We all enjoy observing the local flora and fauna in their natural settings and we often drive and/or walk the back roads looking for deer  moose  bear and whatever else we can spot. One evening we went  Moose Spotting  on Tyson Road since during a summer trip to the same area  earlier  we had observed eight moose in one evening. As we drove along Tyson Road I saw a large bipedal form cross the road in two strides. I asked one of my daughters   Did you see that? Tell me what did you see.  I purposely didn  t say what I  d seen since I wanted to know if she  d seen what I  d seen. I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it. Very quickly she said   I don  t know what it was but it was real big  maybe eight feet tall  hairy and crossed the road in two steps.  She saw the same thing I did.  It crossed the road about 50 feet ahead of us and judging from the trees where it crossed the road I  d say her height estimate is accurate +/- 20%. My other daughter didn  t see it since she was in the back seat and was looking out the side windows of the car. I still don  t quite believe it but I know what bear  deer and moose look like in natural settings since I  ve been hunting for 40 years. It wasn  t anything I had ever seen in the woods. It walked across the road in two strides  was heavily built  covered in short dark hair and  as stated previously  approximately eight  feet tall. One more thing.  The day before  we had driven the same area  didn  t see anything at all  no fauna at all  but we did hear some very odd vocalizations that sound very much like the recordings available on your website. ,It  s off Rt 100 outside of Ludlow Vermont.

4147,I research mountain lions in NH  but I was caring for my mother and hadn  t gotten out since Christmas Day  2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk  no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill  but was determined to at least make it to the power line. I did  but when I turned back to go down to the car  I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them  the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck  s feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long  but it was hard to tell with all the leaves  unevenness  grass  etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree  above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road  so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down. Going back to the car  I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches  but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn  t take a photo. Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought   That  s what that was!  It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead  so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn  t enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). The casts are awful. There were too many leaves  the toes broke off  etc. The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a  Yeah  we get lots of reports of bigfoots  but we try to keep it on the down low.  When I asked him about mountain lion sightings  he seemed scared and said   You think there are mountain lions up there?  It was odd that bigfoot was  normal  and mountain lions were  strange ! When I came back  I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion. Part of his job is to clear the trails and make sure everyone is off the mountain. That night it got dark  and he was also  helped  off the mountain  though  it  always stayed the same distance behind him. ,Park rangers are trying to keep this quiet  but have had reports of bigfoots and tracks.

4148,About 5 30 am on Rte 9 heading east in west Brattleboro VT my husband and I saw a small (I don  t know what) running across the road. It was about 3 to 4 feet tall  long dark brown to black hair  running on 2 legs. I caught the animal in my headlights very clearly. The one thing we both said was that it was fast. Faster than any animal we have ever seen. It was crossing the road into the swampy area near the small whetstone brook. There were tall reeds there and it disappeared into them. We did not stop. in retrospect  I wish I had. It might have answered some questions we both had. ,We were heading east on Route 9 heading into Brattleboro this happened just after the Dollar General.

The conditions on both mornings were clear  cold  and extremely quiet.

4150,I put together a mountain bike trip with a cousin for a weekend in Central Vermont near the town of Plymouth in the Calvin Coolidge state forest. We decided on a Lean-To shelter called TinkerBrook on the outskirts of the forest near the backside of Killington Peak. One reason for this location was because of the steep topography the area offered for a mountain biker. Also  not to many people visit this shelter according to the Rangers I  ve talked to before due to the hike in and lack of 4x4 access as well. The place offers nothing more than a view of a steep forested ravine. The shelter is right on the edge of this ravine as well. We travelled up Shrewsbury road which intersects RT100 south of Plymouth and then heads west almost straight up the nearest mountain in a series of switchbacks. We then parked our vehicle on the bend in the road where tinkerbrook shelter trail starts. The trail/road is heavily blocked off by boulders and easy to miss. We packed up the bikes and headed down the old trail/road to the shelter. The shelter is about a 3/4 mile off the forest road we parked the vehicle on. We set up camp for the night in the shelter and did a look around. The place offered no trails to ride on and the ravine was so steep that you needed to climb out of it using the roots of the trees in it. The place was very isolated. We headed off to bed around 9 00pm and left a campfire going near the opening of the shelter. A few hours later (12 00am) my cousin woke me up saying that he was hearing and feeling knocks on the shelter. I told him to go back to sleep. Then I heard and felt the noises myself. The sounds were like something big pushing against the shelter. I thought it could of been a moose or bear and decided to go around back to see. I took a flashlight and went around back within a minute of hearing the noise again. There was nothing there to see. This continued a few more times during the night until maybe 3 00am. I felt the bumping sounds near my side of the shelter on occasion. We didn  t get much sleep and at one point I even pulled all the firewood close to the opening to keep a large fire going. In the morning we looked for any damage to the shelter and found nothing. We also looked around for any sign on the ground (footprints  loose rocks  scrapes and hoofmarks) but found nothing. We decided not to stay another night and headed out. ,The shelter is in the Calvin Coolidge state forest located on an old logging trail off Shrewsbury road (seasonal) which intersects RT100 outside of Plymouth and continues over the mt  s towards Shrewsbury and Rutland.

When there it was  it just crossed the road and started to go up a hill  it was staring at us with one  foot on a wire fence holding the wire down with its arm and just staring at us  it was not brown but white with yellow dirty streaks and his eyes  oh how they scared me  they were reflecting a yellow/amber color  like the yellow on causion lights  huge man  it was at least 10 ft. tall arms very long  his fur was long  on his face the only flesh part that didnt have fur was his eyes upper cheeks. My husband started to slow down to get a better look  thats when I freaked out and started to hit my husband because I was so scared & my girls were screaming so we kept on going I just kept on thinking about its eyes and was afraid so we wandered if they know its there and we dont want to get shot looking. ,Colchester Vermont Route 2 ,Chittenden,1,Vermont ,VT,Winter ,50007,yes
4153,I am a Civil War re-enactor and I was participating in an event on the grounds of Hildene Mansion  which is Robert Todd Lincoln  s home near Manchester  Vermont.  We were camped on the front lawn of the mansion  which is bordered on two sides by woods.  The whole area is somewhat off the beaten path  the house is probably a half mile from the main road. In the middle of Friday night  I would guess around 1-2 a.m.  I woke up and was walking to the building beside the main house to use the rest room  and as I left my tent and was walking toward the restroom I heard footsteps walking near me in the woods.  They seemed to follow me as I went to the rest room and as I walked back from the rest room they walked back with me to my tent. The whole time walking back I had an uneasy feeling like I was being watched. The next night  Saturday  I was sitting around the campfire around 11 00 pm talking and we heard footsteps coming from the woods which we were right next to  but the noises were coming from inside the woods.  We shined a flashlight on the area that the noise was coming from and it stopped immediatly and as we turned the flashlight off we heard the noises again heading away from us. Both times that I heard the noise it sounded like a large animal and from what I could hear it sounded like a large animal walking on two feet.  While there were other groups at the event I don  t think that it was another person as there were trails that were clear that they could have used. Also of course it was so late at night and there was no light from a lantern or a flashlight. ,You need to get on Vermont Route 7A and the turn-off for the park is labeled. I am not sure of exact directions before then but if you reach the Equinox Hotel you have gone too far. ,Bennington,1,Vermont ,VT,Summer ,50003,no
4154,This Story takes place about 1995 at my Uncle  s Cabin in Morrisville Vermont.  I had been visiting on a summer day with my aunt and uncle. They have a small handbuilt cabin in Morrisville which they have had since the ealy 70  s. They are only there infrequently  so similar events may have occured there that they are not aware of. The cabin itself sits in the middle of an open feild on a small plot of land (1 acre?)  sandwiched between two farms (they are located of the far side of each). The nearest house is about 3/4 of a mile away. The feild is bordered on the other two sides by a dirt road and a heavily wooded ridge. So  this one summer day  I had been up to the cabin for a visit  and we were winding down after dinner inside the cabin. My Uncle noticed a noise in the far distance  and opon listening  my aunt and I noticed as well. Listening  I can only describe this high-pitched sound as exactly like that of a child  screaming as if they were being torn in half. I know that sounds morbid  but thats all I can think of to accuratly describe the sound. It was blood curdling. We continued to listen  and we noticed that the noise was both continuing and getting closer  although it was coming from at least a 3/4 of a mile away at the top of the ridge. My Uncle and I went outside to figure out what was going on. My Uncle is a lifelong hunter and rabid outdoorsman. This guy knows more about New England wilderness than Grizzly Adams. He told me at that point that the noise was definitly animal  was getting closer  and running down the ridge at what he estimated to be about 20 miles an hour  screaming as it went. He said he  d never heard anything like it in his life. Being a very conservative guy  he guessed it might be a jackrabbit  who make some very odd noises when in mating season (no joke!) Well  whatever this thing was was running toward us (still at a comfortable distance)  maybe 1/4 mile. Now  keep in mind  this is the middle of nowhere  at probably 11 pm  we had one lantern in the cabin  and other than that  it was pitch black out. We heard dogs barking at this thing  and my Uncle noted that this thing was going from house to house on the ridge  waking up dogs  and particularlly seemed to bother one home of a man who raised german sheppards (he gathered this from the scream  s direction and the intentsity of the dogs   barking) and that this was an odd thing for a jackrabbit to do. My Uncle asked my aunt at this point for his pistol and a flashight  and we stood on the porch listening to this thing run around for 15 mins. Then  it started right toward us  maybe it saw the cabin? I asked my Uncle is maybe we should go inside  to which my Uncle said not to worry  as  we were well armed! The screaming had started and stopped a few times during this incident and we were calculating its position by that.  Well  that thing (whatever it was) got within 100 feet of us  screamed   stopped for a minute  turned and ran  fast  the other direction. All we could make out was a dark shape and a pair of eyes reflecting our light about 4 foot off the ground. It then headed straight down the valley and continued to wake up dogs  screaming as it went. We never did find out what it was. The hair on the back of my neck stands up thinking about it even now.  ,The incident occured 2 to 3 miles outside of Morrisville village in a field just off the road. ,Lamoille,3,Vermont ,VT,Summer ,50015,no
4155,The sighting was today (8/6/19) at 10 15 am at our VT summer cabin. I am 67  retired RN & former private pilot with excellent vision- 20/15  so I was not mistaken. It was not a bear. We have had a bear here by the deck  so I know what bears look like standing up to the reach feeder. It was sunny day. My small Chihuahua mix was out front in her cage. She was barking so I walked out to front deck and looked towards dirt road where she was looking. We sit back approx.125ft from the road. I saw a very black humanoid shape walking on two legs go past our driveway. It was half bent over then straightened up. It had  longs arms swinging. The head was turned away & appeared to have very short neck & roundish head from that angle. I said to myself   That looks like a chimp! . I watched for it for approx.12 seconds until it disappeared behind trees going east on road.  There are spots that I can see thru the trees to the neighbors drive  so I was looking for it to either go up the drive or continue on road. When it did not  I walked out to end of drive  approx. 200 ft. ( w/ my air horn). There was nothing on the road for some distance. Later in day I went out to that area with my small dog. She refused to even walk and was trembling. This is the same dog that almost went thru a screen door to attack the bear by our feeder a few weeks ago. I noticed an area of bent weeds that would have been where the creature had exited our woods  going into a small ditch then back up to get onto road before walking past our drive. On the roadside  in the direction I saw it going   there were 3 barefoot heel depressions w/ faint toe marks approx. 12 inches long.  The area was dry with fine gravel so not a clear print. The week before  I had heard twigs snapping & weeds moving behind my fenced garden. This approx. 40 ft from the front porch where I often sit. The dog barked. The noise stopped then started again  so I fired off my air horn which I always have near after an encouter with a large coy-wolf. The cabin sits about 100ft  above the N. Branch Lamoille River. There are many snowmobile & ATV trails plus the Long Trail is only 1/5 miles. It was very wooded and remote. A few homes and camps on our road. ,[Removed from report] ,Lamoille,3,Vermont ,VT,Summer ,50015,yes
