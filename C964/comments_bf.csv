"I am not sure how relevant this report will be, however I thought it important to add so that any other possible events in the area could be correlated. I was driving; my wife was in the passenger seat and had the ""sighting"". We had already been through Yellowstone, on a cross country trip and had been on the lookout for wildlife all through our driving, so my wife was very sure of what she saw. She had been good about picking out Antelope, Deer, and a Grizzly bear on earlier days during our trip. We were proceeding up the mountain pass, and were in the middle of the switchbacks when my wife saw what she described as ""A man in dark clothes"" on the side of the road on an upcoming part of the pass. She was visibly surprised that the ""Man"" was not there as we turned the corner where he would have been. There were steep cliffs on each side of the road, with no turnouts and very little shoulder. She told me that she was paying attention as we rounded the switchback were he would have been so she could warn me about the man on the side of the road.",Washakie County,Wyoming,Summer,yes
"I don't know if what I saw was two bigfoots or something else, but one thing I know is they were things I've never seen before. I also know they weren't bears. I worked in the coal mines near a small town called Amigo. What I used to do (my job description) was coal sampler. I would drive around all day collecting coal for chemical analysis, from the high walls to the deep mine. The deep mine is more remote since they just put the belt head in. It is so far from the plant to the deep mines it would take me about 30 to 35 minutes driving in the mountains. Last week I was driving back from picking up a sample and noticed something running back up in the woods. It was two does. Then I noticed something was laying on the ground. I beeped my horn thinking it was a bob cat and up jumped this light tan (just a little bit darker than the deers skin) thing. I froze. It was definitely wasn't a man or bear. All I know is it was walking upright. It did something that looked like it clapped its hands.  Then I watched it kneel down and crawl into an airshaft for an abandonned mine. To my surprise, another one appeared out of nowhere and ran past it. I could tell this one was only a couple inches taller than me (6-7). I do know it was something I’ve never seen before.  The second one kneeled down and crawled into the same airshaft.",Wyoming County,West Virginia,Winter,yes
"My family and I went to Ludlow, Vermont for Columbus Day weekend since we enjoy the northeastern woods. We all enjoy observing the local flora and fauna in their natural settings and we often drive and/or walk the back roads looking for deer, moose, bear and whatever else we can spot. One evening we went ""Moose Spotting"" on Tyson Road since during a summer trip to the same area, earlier, we had observed eight moose in one evening. As we drove along Tyson Road I saw a large bipedal form cross the road in two strides. I asked one of my daughters, ""Did you see that? Tell me what did you see."" I purposely didn't say what I'd seen since I wanted to know if she'd seen what I'd seen. I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it. Very quickly she said, ""I don't know what it was but it was real big, maybe eight feet tall, hairy and crossed the road in two steps."" She saw the same thing I did.  It crossed the road about 50 feet ahead of us and judging from the trees where it crossed the road I'd say her height estimate is accurate +/- 20%. My other daughter didn't see it since she was in the back seat and was looking out the side windows of the car. I still don't quite believe it but I know what bear, deer and moose look like in natural settings since I've been hunting for 40 years. It wasn't anything I had ever seen in the woods. It walked across the road in two strides, was heavily built, covered in short dark hair and, as stated previously, approximately eight  feet tall. One more thing.  The day before, we had driven the same area, didn't see anything at all, no fauna at all, but we did hear some very odd vocalizations that sound very much like the recordings available on your website.",Windsor County,Vermont,Fall,yes
"It was spring break 1984 and I was 16 at the time. My dad myself and my brother were on this trip to visit my mother in Florida. When we got about half way through Virginia I was just looking out the window, bored of course,  then bam! Just like that I see this large hairy black creature walking in the woods in between the trees about 20 or 30 yards away from the road I believe. At first I thought I was losing my mind and it didnt make any sense to see something that should not exist. I was blown away.  It just walked along un-disturbed by the moving cars. My younger brother looked and saw the creature moving along as well. When I saw this creature I finally blurted out Bigfoot! My dad had his eyes on the road and thought we were joking or something. I will never forget that day and as far as I am concerned bigfoot is very much a reality. It looked very much like the bigfoot in the Patterson film almost identical I would say. The creature was a classic giant ape that looked heavy. About 8 feet tall and weighing upwards of 500 pounds I suppose. It had a very long stride with arms swaying back and forth and its head a little bit lowered, it really did look very similar to the bigfoot in the 67' Patterson film. The hair was jet black head to toe, I couldnt make out any facial features. I asked my brother about this the other day (he lives in Georgia), he said he saw the same thing but not in the detail I did because we were cruising along at 60mph, but my brother said it was very large, black, stood upright and was moving along.",Wythe County,Virginia,Spring,yes
"It was the winter of 1996 and we were on our way home from church one Sunday evening. It wasn't dark yet. As we came around a corner we watched what we believe to be a bigfoot cross the road. As it came to a barb wired fence it stepped over it without missing a beat. It was like the fence wasn't even there. The fences in this area range from 3 1/2 feet to 4 foot tall. It was tall, dark in color and walked up right. There have been other sightings because our river bottoms were turned into a major lake project. Years ago I had heard the scream of the bigfoot which is something you don't forget.",Wood County,Texas,Winter,yes
"My brother and I were out riding our mini bike one afternoon after school approximately 4:00 to 5:00 P.M.. It was the beginning of Spring and we were searching for bait to go fishing.  We parked our bike on the road, which at the time was gravel and traveled very little. We walked down a path that was used by a farmer to get to his pasture were he had cattle grazing. As we walked down the path I felt as though we were being watched. It was an eerie feeling that still haunts me to this day as I recall the incident. Off to my left and approximately 30 to 40 yards away, and 50 or so yards from the main road, was a hairy creature standing in a bent over slump raking it's arms through a patch of May apple. My brother saw it at about the same time. At that moment the two of us ran as fast as we could not looking at each other, but looking at the creature over our shoulders. I was afraid that it would come after us, but it stood in the patch of May apple looking at us as though it didn't know what to make of us. I have told this story many times since that day. Many people laugh in disbelief, but I know what I saw and it could only be one of two things. Either someone dressed in a Bigfoot costume, or it was Bigfoot himself.",Williamson County,Tennessee,Spring,yes
"This happened to me when I was 13 in upstate South Carolina.  It was in the fall and it was late afternoon.  We, my family, live in a very secluded part of the Piedmont area.  The area is located in York County SC. Located on the Road that I live is a hollow that branches of into a wooded area.  During the fall, both sides of that hollow bear wild grapes/scuffonons.  My mother, Joyce, had asked me to ride up the road to get my fathers paper.  You see I had forgotten after the school bus dropped me off to pick up the Evening Herald.  Any way I got on my Red Murray Bike and rode up the road.  My plot hound, Butler, plodded along beside of me.  As I biked up the road, the forest is on my left, field on my right, I began to notice a smell berry similar to a yard that has been freshly cut with wild onions growing in it.  My dog noticed it first and began to slow down At was then that I looked into the hollow and saw what has changed my life from that moment on. The creature stood about as tall as a small shed and was very large.  It was covered with a light brown hair that showed up amber like an aurora around its body when the sun hit it.  The face was very much like a Mongoloid man, and the eyes, hard to tell, brown.  It was eating grapes and its teeth were yellowish.  My dog left at this point and went back toward the house.  It looked at me moved in my direction in a curious notion.  I became scared and left towards home.  I did look back to see it lumber over the fence.  It came out of the forest only briefly and went back.  My uncle was the only one who saw it again after that.",York County,South Carolina,Fall,yes
"While attending U.R.I in the Fall of 1974,I would stay at my girlfriends mother's house on weekends because I only had a five day mealbook plan. It was Sunday evening about 10:00pm when I decided to head back to school on my ten speed bike. Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded, country like setting but yet city. I was going down her street and noticed my front center pull brake needed to be adjusted. I stopped under a street light at the end of her street which is an intersection to adjust the brake. Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me,pitch black background, tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light. Typical New England, Oak, Maple and, Pine trees. As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped, comig from the field on the slope side,more like a crushing thud. I could hear the actual compression being placed, like someone dropping a heavy metal ball/rock on the ground.I looked up to see if I could see anything and just said to myself ""its nothing"", and went back to fixing my brake. I noticed it was getting closer and felt very apprehensive, the sound was coming in my direction. All of sudden this dog starts barking like crazy, I can hear the chain snap as it either tries to attack or getaway from something. I said to myself ""its time to go!"", as I started I turned left to head north, into a few pedals. From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla. The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles. Twenty maybe twenty five feet away, directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more. Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles, knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass. The face dark, deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face. The nose and mouth are human like, it's nose is wide, around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me, eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real. Humanlike in appearance, the face is not like a primate but has a distinct animal presence (the eye are close together). I was never so scared in my life and knew had I stayed I don't think I would of survived the attack.The way it was positioned gave it an explosive start as it decides to chase me down the street. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs, then down on its knuckles then back up again. Perhaps for ten yards, I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach,I thank god I was in first gear. A good five second chase and it was all over.It had stopped in the middle of the street just swaying back and forth, turned and just cleared this rock wall all in one motion from a grass sidewalk. At the top of hill I began riding in circles, I didn't know what to do, I could not comprehend the situation I was in. I knew one thing I was not riding back. I cut through her grandmother's yards and made it back to her house. Not trying to look crazy or anything they ask me what's wrong ? I told them what happened and agreed  that it was best to go back in the morning.",Washington County,Rhode Island,Fall,yes
"Hello, My name is Doug and though I am very reluctant to post this story; I am going to do so anyways. The area that this happened  could not be a more unlikely area for a bigfoot occurance then or  especially now with all the development of the farmland in the last 25 years which has been extensive and at a phenominal rate. After reading many (if not every last report on this website) and coming across more that a few that have happened in improbable areas (bigfoot running down neighborhood streets and sightings/ vocalizations near condo areas), I decided there just might be some merit in submitting this for review. A skilled researcher might be able to shed some more light maybe. My friends parents owned a small somewhat defunct farm with (I'm guessing maybe 15-20 acres of land -not the best judge on that) They had 3 horses; 2 mares that were allowed out in the field areas; a stabled stallion, and a pony I believe. The barn was in dis-repair and part of the roof had collapsed years earlier. There was a large pond that was almost completely enclosed with an impenatrable thicket of briars ringing almost the whole cirmcuference of the pond, except for a small area that was kept open for access for the horses to water. Much of the property was overgrown with these same briars that tended to make big circular mounds here and there in the field. The house sat close to the road; the barn to the left and further behind. The extreme left side of their property was bordered by a small stream that edged along a small (100 ft x 30 ft) stand of very dense pine trees. These pines (species unknown) tend to have a very dense understory of almost horizontal dead, dry, branches due to years of growth an minimal sunlight. The lower end of this pine grove had a mowed lawn area (next door neighbors property who were also related to my friend family) You had to access the camping area through the neighbors propery as the overgrowth of briars and other weeds, brambles, trees made it impossible to get there directly for the E------- property. The pond in relation to the campsite was to the left if you were looking back up towards the road; with the stream running between. The dense pine grove then lay between you and the road; unless you skirted around it through the neigbors backyard. This is what happened. No sighting but a vocalization. We had gone down to the campsite had built a fire and been down there for about an hour. During this time we all felt uneasy even though we had been there before many times. This is a long time ago but to the best of my memory we had been joking; probably made something to eat over the fire but something felt really wrong this time. ""Wrong"" is the best word I can use to describe. I remember I felt like I couldn't just sit down by the fire and stay with the conversation though. From back in the pine grove was the occasional, deliberate braking of branches that were just a little too large (to the sophisticated human ear) and just had the sound of being ""up off the ground some ways"" This would start and stop. We would listen and comment on it. First we thought maybe the mares had gotten back into the woods, unusual but this later was confirmed not to be so because we found out the next day that they were stabled for the night. We then thought it might be some older boys who were trying to scare us into running. It would be quiet for awhile then there would be a sense of movement closer to where we were and then receeding. We shined a flashlight and ventured back alittle ways but saw or smelled nothing. The sounds began again this time definately agitated, insistent with a very permiable feeling. We started to get un-nerved  moved out into the neighbors backyard. The sound grew louder, with traceable movement and then this ear splitting scream cut right out into the night. One loud shriek louder than anything should have to be. It just cut right to the core of your soul. Like so many reports I've read on this website, it's virtually impossible to do it justice with a human description precisly because it sounded so inhuman. We just ran like hell back to the house, left everything behind. No sense of being followed at all. No visual sighting (I almost wish). No bad smells or odors. In terms of other reports this pales, I know. But this is what happened and I never forgot it. We knew what Sasquatch were at the time, but no one ever heard of sightings east of the Mississippi to the best of my memory then. We kind of joked that maybe that's what our unseen friend was. Years later when I read and saw the reports from the southern part of York County (report on file with your website.) did I ever give any serious thought.",York County,Pennsylvania,Summer,no
"It was May 1984. Two friends and I were up in the hills nw of Yamhill, OR, late in the evening, around 10:30 pm. We heard the scream, a VERY low, very long howl. Not a coyote, bear or cougar. Have heard all of them before. This was nothing like anything I have ever heard. I still remember thinking to myself ""How in the hell can something make such a low howl."" It scared us at first, but is sounded like it was far away, like maybe a mile or so. We were drinking a little beer, so after awhile we relaxed and forgot about it. It must have been about a half hour later when we heard it again. I swear that it had to be within 30 yards of us. Same loud, low howl, but MUCH closer. And it sounded pissed. I could feel the sound vibrations bouncing off the back of my neck. The hair stood up on the back of all of our necks. All of us turned white as hell, and our jaws dropped past our knees. The howl seemed to say ""GET OUT!"" Which is EXACTLY what we did. I just looked at the two other guys and said ""lets get the @#$ outta here "". We did not see anything, but felt the presence. I grew up within 10 miles of that spot. I had never heard that sound before, or since, EXCEPT on a television show that had a report of a bigfoot sighting. A guy in Idaho caught one on video (at least it looked like one), but when I saw the video, I heard that scream again. The guy taking the video threw the camera in the ditch, and hid. It was the SAME scream. ONLY other time that I have EVER heard it. It was EXACTLY the same scream. I saw this video on a news show, something like ""Real TV"" while in Fairfax, VA, in 1992 or 1993. I do not know EXACTLY what it is that we heard, but I know what I think it was. Bigfoot. That is my story, and I have two wittnesses to back me up.",Yamhill County,Oregon,Spring,no
"My two children and I were returning from Altus,  Oklahoma to Burns Flat, Oklahoma in the fall of 1973 when a very large black man-like creature crossed the highway moving from west to east. I was driving and my son (age 11) was sitting in the front seat beside me and my daughter (age 12) was sitting in the back seat leaning forward between the driver and passenger seat. It was a clear sunny day about 3 PM and there was a lull in the conversation. It was quiet in the car, we did not have the radio on and all three of us were happened to be looking straight ahead. I noticed a movement on the left side of the road and was amazed to see a what I percieved to be a very large black man-like creature rise from a squatting position and run across the two lane highway about 30 yards ahead. It ran across the highway, covering the distance in only three steps, I estimate the creature to have been at least 8 feet tall, it glanced briefly in the direction of the car and I instictively applied the brake so as not to hit it. It ran into the bar ditch on the east side of the road and ducked into some brush and large bushes between the ditch and the barbed wire fence. It had hair that looked rather silky as it ran, I remember seeing the hair move as it ran. The hair did not appear to be stiff like an animals hair but more soft and shiny. Both children saw it too and said ""What was that, mama?"" I said I didn't know, they wanted me to stop the car, but I was frightened that my children and I could be harmed by something I had never seen before in my life. I didn't tell anyone what I had seen and cautioned the children not to say anything either.",Washita County,Oklahoma,Fall,yes
"I was staying the night with a friends of mine. It was late at night we were watching TV waiting on his parents to come home. We heard a noise out front and I looked out the window in the door to the mobile home. A large face was looking in the window. The face had a very heavy brow with deepest eyes, the nose was wide and flat with flared nostrils. The lips were thick and rubbery looking with thick block like teeth. The hair was about one inch long on the face and it sweptback from the brow with a large lump standing up on the top of the head. The head sat on the shoulders with no sigh of a neck. It let out a scream and it pushed off from the door. My friend grabbed his 22 rifle and we went out the back door in time to see it step NOT JUMP but step over a 3 strand barb wire fence and run in a hunched over motion with it's arms swinging it's hands below it's knees. The next day we looked for tracks but found none. We did measured the distance from the ground to the window of the door (there was no front steps) 7'6"".",Washington County,Ohio,Summer,yes
"Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school ""Planets of the Apes"" chimps..I said to my buddy ""you see that?""?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I'm puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn't catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??... This was my post on www.westchesterfishing.com Low and be hold another member at the same reservior..Columbus day 2011..this is his post..Hey Guys, I put at Amawalk this summer and about the 5th time I took it out in early October.  I saw two upright walking chimp looking things walk out of the woods and crouch down and drink from the res, run back in to the woods and then do the same thing again.  When they came out the second time one of them threw it's arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods.   The second one went back slowly.  It seemed like they saw something in the water right in front of them.  That was right when the sun came up.  I haven't been back to my boat since.  I have no idea what they were and looked like two large chimps to me.  Maybe some guy who lives there has two monkeys or something?  I have no idea.  But I saw something that I can't explain, it has been eating away at me since.  When I saw the preview for that show I almost shat myself.  When Biggame posted here I didn't want to say that I saw something because I'm from Oregon and my hunting and logging part of the family thinks they know where they live but none of them have never ever seen them just have stories, just like everyone else in Oregon.  Then I saw what I saw in October and have been denying it to myself ever since.  I absolutely hope that someone owns two monkey's on the Amawalk. I have no reason to say something like this.  Before October I could have cared less if bigfoot existed, now I'm a bit curious.  I own a fishing rod company and have business to lose from people thinking I'm crazy for posting this on here.  This is a nothing to gain and allot to lose situation for me but, I had to say something when Biggame posted.  Let me be clear in saying that I saw something too.  I have no idea what they were and would need absolute proof that bigfoot existed before I would ever say thats what they were. So two seperate sightings same place different year..I BELIEVE!!!",Westchester County,New York,Fall,no
"This may not even be relevant now because it happened so many years ago, but when I was about 10 years old my sister and I were out in our yard playing a yard dart game ( the kind where you throw the plastic flower onto a stake in the yard) the only reason I mention what kind of game it was is to let you know how vivid this still remains in my mind. But anyway, we were playing in the yard it was close to getting dark but still daylight enough so that you could still see.  I don't quite remember if I heard a noise or what made me look across our road but when I looked, across the road on the edge of the woods I saw an image, similar to drawings I've seen of actual encounters.   It was walking at the edge of the woods kind of stooped over, using its hands to push the trees back out of its way.   All I could do was just stand there and look at it not really knowing what I was seeing.   I really don't know how long I stood there but I remember yelling at my sister who was then 7 years old, and telling her to run into the house.   She then looked and saw the same thing. As soon as I yelled at my sister it stopped dead in its tracks and just stood there and looked at us.   My sister and I still remember the feeling of not being able to move, and to this day we still get cold chills and our eyes water every time we talk about this. So anyway we eventually ran inside the house.  When we got in the house I remember my mom asking what was wrong because she said that both of us were as white as sheet.  We then went on to tell her what we had seen and were terrified to have her go outside  and check things out. Neither one of my parents ever saw anything but still to this day say they believe we did see something, whether it was someone playing a joke or possibly a bear but I still think to this day that it was Bigfoot or something similar.",Washington County,Ohio,Summer,yes
I would like to share with you what I saw as a boy. I saw a Bigfoot standing over our burn barrel. I remember being very young when this happened. But I have never forgot what I saw. It was strong and tall but not real tall.  Maybe six foot ten to seven feet tall. It had a smell to him I will never forget. I knew he was still there down in the hollow where I was raised as a child. When we would cut firewood in the saw mill he would make us feel weird like he didn't want us there. My mom would say start the truck and don't stop until we get to the top of the ridge. We found footprints one winter that were very wide at the heel and very large in size like 17-20 inches long. I hope someone hears what I have to say. I would love to talk to someone about this. I know he is still there! It's a perfect place for him to live with so much forest and hills.,Washington County,Ohio,Winter,yes
"It was July 4th, 1984. I was 17 and between my junior and senior year of high school. I went to the fireworks in Beverly, Ohio and had met a young lady (sorry I don't recall her name) who was staying with some friends that lived near Churchtown. We watched the fireworks, then I offered to drive her home. I don't know the township road, but it is off state Route 676. We parked for a while then drove on to where she was staying. On the way to the house she had fallen asleep with her head in my lap, so she didn't see a thing. As I drove about 15 mph along these backroads, I rounded a slight turn where the banks on either side rose about six feet. On both sides of the road were fence and cornfields. Then, on the left side of the road behind the fence was a large hair covered, gray or white colored figure standing by the fence line. I was stunned and didn't say a word and just kept driving along slowly looking at this thing. As I went by it just looked at me. I didn't have a clue what to do, so I kept going. When I looked in the rear view mirror I saw it turn and go back into the cornfield. I didn't tell anyone for a while, but eventually told a couple friends who just smiled.",Washington County,Ohio,Summer,yes
"My two brothers, cousin, and I were out playing a little war game with our toy guns. We ranged from the ages of  8 to 14 me being the oldest. We divided up in teams of two, my brothers were on a team and were going to go hide to which me and my cousin would try and find them after giving them some time to hide. We heard them scream and we stood up and were kinda worried because we were on the opposite side of the house than them. So we got up to make sure they were all right, but they came around the house before we could get to far. They went on to tell us that they heard something really big running in the thick patch of woods. My brother was going into the thicket to hide. When he started in that's when he heard something take off running. The sun was about to disappear as night grew nearer and he was still spooked from the noise he heard and refused to go hide anymore. I just thought that it was probably a deer since our area is very populated with them. So we got off the porch and was walking around the corner of the house when I looked up towards the road. Now to give you a brief description of the terrain. From where the thicket ends there is about 20 yards of short mowed grass which meets up with State Route 550 then on the other side of the road it slopes down fairly sharp and then into a cornfield. As it was striding across the road is where I saw it. It's arms were swaying back and forth and I remember the hair hanging from its arms. The body was very thick, thicker than any human body I've ever seen. The head looked like it ended in a point rather than a rounded head like a humans. It seemed to run in slow motion as I stood there in amazement. It went over the bank when it got to the other side of the road. We jumped up onto the porch and went inside to tell my dad. He just laughed at us and so have most people that I have told this to since then. I can still see that image in my head as if it just happened.",Washington County,Ohio,Summer,yes
"After getting online to your site we decided to go to a known sighting area as an afternoon excursion since the day was nice.  After walking up several steep inclines and falling often we came up to another ridge that was very difficult to climb for us. We spotted a foot print actually my boyfriend did. I knew he had found something when he called for me to come quick and climb up the last area. I climbed up and there it was a foot print.  I did not really believe in Bigfoot but now we are having second thoughts. Mind you we drove two hours one way, and walked for at least hour up hill off the trails.  We even went back the next day which was today 11/1/09 and made a cast of the print. Of course it was not as deep as yesterday but we still took the print and have pictures from yesterday on the cell phone.",Washington County,Ohio,Fall,no

"I've told very few people this story for fear that they might think I'm crazy. The only reason why I'm taking the time to report this is because of a recent entry a friend of mine who knew my story told me about. My story takes place in Charlestown, Rhode Island in the late 1970's. My mother and father and I lived in a wooded area abutting the ""Indian Cedar Swamp"" and property owned by United Nuclear which probably comprises several thousand acres. The property surrounding our home was mixed  white Atlantic juniper swamp,scarlet, red and white oaks with old growth white pine stands mixed in, with a dense understory of briars, mountain laurel and blue berry brush. We lived off a road with 3 houses on it. The houses were all built close to the entrance of this development. The road was part of a series of roads that were put in as the start of a development. The roads were oiled gravel and had been left to grow in after years of little or no use. It looked like the developer had started and went belly-up. These roads were great to ride bikes on or take a evening cruise on after bringing my father dinner at his second job. My mother drove a baby blue Mustang Mach 1 and she would drive around the roads with me looking at deer before we retired to our home for the evening. As a kid I remember this being a highlight to the evening. I was at the time maybe 8 years old and my mother and I on this particular night in the late 70's commenced our ride around the roads to see if we sould see any deer. It had been raining earlier with thunder and lightning mixed in. Now it was just raining. We were rounding a corner on one of the roads that paralleled the Indian Cedar Swamp and as we started downward,  we noticed the road was obstructed by a large blown down oak tree, the tree had green leaves (this makes me think it was summer or the early fall) on it so it had recently come down, we guessed maybe in the storm earlier(possibly lightning). The road was very narrow and the brush along the side of the road made it difficult to back the car around to turn around. The rain was falling but not heavy, the wipers were on, the headlights on the car were on as well. As my mother turned the front end  of the car the lights cast on the left side of the road where the tree had been broken off from its stump. We were maybe 1 1/2 car lengths from the stump. Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape. It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall, its hair was long, face flat, long massive arms, its head appeared to be without any neck, its chest was broad. My mother and I froze momentarily (5 seconds, maybe 10) and the figure remained still, staring at us. My mother floored the car into reverse. I remember ther terror of it all. The sound of gravel hitting inside the fender wells, the sound of the brush crushing against the car and then the acceleration as she sped off. We were clear as to what we saw and we have no question in our mind that we saw something or someone in ape like shape that night. This we are certain of. We need no one to tall us what we saw, it's crystal clear. For years we told no one. We would talk about it in our home in privacy and even my father found this story hard to accept. We've never forgotten this and this story would have never been told if it wasn't for someone else informing me of a similar sigthing. I'm now in my 30's an extremely active hunter, farmer and woodsman. I hunt deer 40 days a year in Maine, RI, CT and New Jersey. I use automated cameras which are triggered by heat. I've never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film. I have seen pictures of deer on my 50 acre tract of land that I would never believe are there if I didn't see it on my film. I know every inch of my land and the surrounding property and these mystery deer show up at all hours on my cameras and frequently at that. How can they move right around our hunting parties in such a small area and never be seen, I'll never know, Even today I find it hard to accept what we definitely saw. I'm not a fan of ghosts, UFO's or even big foot. I'm not sure to this day what I saw wasn't a man in a costume, dressed up, out in rainstorm, a half mile or more from any home, waiting for my mother and me to drive down the road to give us a scare. The only thing I can say is it was a damn' good costume and a damn' good plan. We saw what we saw and this is something I would sware to on any polygraph test as I'm sure my mother would.",Washington County,Rhode Island,Summer,yes
"I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot. After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road, I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit.",Washington County,Rhode Island,Fall,no
I was walking in the [power line cut] near Daimler Blvd. At around 2:00 PM today I heard loud knocking sounds come from [both sides of cut]. It didn’t sound mechanical but like wood on wood.  Each time I heard one I would then hear another as if in response.,York County,South Carolina,Summer,no
"When I was a boy, about 10 years ago, I was walking in the snow one morning on my Grandmother's farm.  I came across some footprints in the snow that would be appoximately the size and shape of an adult human's foot, but with one exception.  Both feet had only four toes. The area is rural, but is populated and this particular area is in an open field that is in plain view of a well-traveled road.  Similar tracks appeared in the snow the following year.  Unfortunately I was too young to drive to the store for film and no one else in my family seemed to care about my findings.  Several years later, approximately 1993-1994, I had another strange experience on our small farm.  I never connected the two events until reading some other stories on your web-site.  One night I stepped out of our house into the car-port.  The car-port was brightly illuminated, but none of the other exterior lights were on.  This made it impossible to see outides the perimiter of the car-port.  As I stepped out of the house, something screamed at me from the darkness, a screma like I had never heard.  It was not human, it was too wild, but it sounded more human than animal.  It seemed to be both a warning and a scream of terror.  I was told that it was probably a wildcat, but never believed it to sound like a cat at all.  I wasn't aware that screaming was associated with bigfoot.  I am now wondering if the number of toes I mentioned earlier is in order?",Wilson County,Tennessee,Winter,no
I heard a series of screams/howls that are not of ANY animal I know to be in the state of TN.,Wilson County,Tennessee,Fall,no
"Yesterday,I ,my dad,my son,and his Friend, went up to our farm in Wilson County to do some bush hogging and prepare our deer stands for the up coming season..The kids asked if they could walk the logging road to see if they could see any deer or turkeys while me and my dad bush hogged the fields. About 20 minutes went by and I see my son and his friend running towards the tractor out of breath..""Dad,i don't care if you believe me or not but what we just saw...I never want to see again!""..His friend said she saw it first. This is the story they have repeatedly told me all afternoon yesterday and this morning- They were walking the logging Rd,and my son started hearing these loud crashes in front of them to the right coming towards them,He said he stopped and felt ""Very uneasy"" about going any further,to which he told his friend ""he wasn't going any farther and she could if she wanted""..She walked around the bend of the road,come walking fast back to him  and says ""There was this thing looking at me behind a tree,swaying left to right,as if to see what she was..It leaned as if to be curious..So, She,not wanting to show it any harm by running or sudden  movement,afraid it would chase her,just turned and walked fast back to my son,and told him ""There is something huge and black standing around the corner""...My son started walking with her and turned back to see if he could see anything and it had came around the corner and was staring at them..He said it was between 7-8ft tall,had blackish/brown,almost like a turkeys feather color when the sun is not shining on its feathers, and had HUGE muscles showing through the fur,he especially notice how broad the shoulders were and how muscular the arms were.At that time they started running as fast as they could until they got to the field i was cutting.. I eventually got in my truck and drove to the spot/area they said this all happened..The woods were a ""dead quiet""..No Tracks were found,i did not smell any foul odor,as i have heard this animal has, plus a storm was approaching so i had to get back and put the tractor up. My son,who is sitting beside me as i type this,says ""I just don't feel it meant any harm,it was puzzled as why we were there."" There were men cutting hay on the next farm over which had not been done in quite a while.There is no hunting,no more cattle,that place is not disturbed at all,so maybe it came from there?? What makes me believe even more is that my son LOVES hunting and that farm,but now says he is not coming up unless he has protection(Gun)and will not walk the place alone.Whatever this was or whatever happened to them has changed them.The friend,which said she doesn't believe in Bigfoot,now is a firm believer. My son's words-""It wasn't scared of us,but we sure were of it!""",Wilson County,Tennessee,Summer,yes
"Driving back to property on Beech Log Road, saw a black stocky figure crossing a bridge. Arms were swinging widely. Dark black. Could not see face. cone shaped head. Saw from the creatures left side as we drove. Creature was partially obscured by a post on the bridge.",Wilson County,Tennessee,Fall,yes
"I was hunting hogs and felt I was being watched all day. I turned around to go back to the truck. It was sitting beside a tree. It stood up and I looked at it through a scope. It walked away like I was not even there. [It was] big, very big. The hair on it was dark brown, close to a chestnut horse. The hair was long and matted. The face had no hair on it. It looked almost soft. It eyes were big and brown, very soft and thoughtful like it was working things out. I wished I could draw to show what I mean.",Wood County,Texas,Winter,yes
"My husband works on a huge ranch (about 750 acres) outside of Quitman Texas.  The area is heavily wooded.  He often has to trap wild hogs on the property because they tear up and root up everything.  Anyway, he was at the very back of the property checking traps and he saw something run behind a tree.  It was very big, hairy, and running on two feet.  He said the color was charcoal gray and it was about 6 feet tall.  He did not see it again after it hid behind the tree because he left the area immediately.  It really scared him and he says that it reminded him of a huge monkey or ape.  The area that this took place is very secluded with nothing but thick woods all around.",Wood County,Texas,Spring,yes
"This sighting took place in Utah...Wasatch Mtns, 1962...I was five years old at the time. My dad was stationed at Hill AFB. One weekend in the spring my family and two others from the base went on a picnic. We traveled up in to the mountains off of hiway 89. We were in the Wasatch national forest, going toward the present day ski areas, only less developed at the time. There was snow on the higher peaks, but a pleasent day. The time was morning about 9:00 to 10:00 am. I couldn't wait to play in the mountains! When we arrived at our location, a open area just 100 yrds off the road, the adults started setting up the grill and setting up other things. I was with three other children around my age, and we ran off up the side of a large mountain. There we found an small open field and starting play hide-and go-seek. We were about 200 yds from our parents and there was no one else around, no cars, or other people. The area had a lot of smaller pines and scrub brush. We felt safe where we were. After 20 minutes or so we went up the mountain a little further and began playing. There was a small mound on the west side of where we were playing and I thought that would be a great spot to hide. As the counting began I ran around the mound and was trying to hide when, I got the feeling I was being watched. I turned around and about thirty feet from me, standing beside a large tree and bush was a very large creature.  It was just standing there watching me and I was looking at it. It didn't make any aggresive moves or sounds...it was just content watching me. It had reddish-brown long hair over its body. Dark eyes, and fairly tall. I slowly got up and started walking backward... our eyes locked on one another. Its like we both were in a trance or something. Some feeling inside of me told me this was not a safe situation and thats when I broke off the stare and ran as fast as I could. I ran right past my friends and started screeming all the way down the mountain. When I arrived at the picnic site, I was almost too excited to talk. I ran to my dad and told him what I saw and he and the other adults  agreed that I saw something... but perhaps only a deer or bobcat. My dad agreed to go back there to check this out. When we got back to the site...we of course found nothing, but later on as we were leaving the area, I happened to look up at the part of the mountain we were playing on and there it was again in the same spot...watching us leave! Before I could say anything, we rounded the corner and lost sight of it. For years after I was terrified of going in to forest alone. At the time of the incident there was no talk about bigfoot...It was not in the media and not on television. I just knew that I saw a strange creature. Years later I saw a photo or a drawing and it brought back this memory. I believe that this creature was watching us kids play and was very interested in us.",Weber County,Utah,Spring,yes
"On Aug. 15, 1998, I sent the following E-mail to: ameyer@weber.edu After looking through a couple of Bigfoot web sites, I thought he might be the best one to send it to. Now after looking through your web site, I guess I should have looked a little further. Oh well, FYI here's a copy of my story. Dear Mr Meyer I want to tell you about what happened a very long time ago, 1968. I was living up Ogden canyon, in a house in Wheeler canyon, the second one to be exact. It was fall and there were alot of leaves on the ground. Very late one evening I was sitting in the living room watching TV, my 2 year old son was in the back bedroom asleep. The chair I was sitting in was angled with it's back to the windows. I got up to go into the kitchen to get a drink, when I turned around in the kitchen to walk back into the livingroom I was shocked to see a pair of glowing red eyes staring at me from the window behind my chair through the window. The porch light was also shining through that same window to the left (from my point of view) of the creatures head. All I could see of it was mainly a very dark mass outlined in the window and the eyes which were reflecting the light and seemed to glow red. I stood in the kitchen doorway frozen, I kept trying to tell myself I was seeing things and it wasn't really there. After all, I did enjoy monster movies, even though the show I was watching that night was a love story, I kept trying to convince myself it was just my imagination. I finally turned and put my back against the wall inside the kitchen doorway and told myself that I'd clear my mind and when I turned around again it would not be there. I waited long enough to compose myself and then turned back into the doorway to go into the living room. It didn't work, my visitor was still there! I want you to know that at that time in my life I had never heard of a bigfoot. The only thing in my mind that could look like that was a werewolf and, ofcourse, everyone knows they are only movie myth. I turned around again and walked back to the bedroom where my son was sleeping. I was very shaken and the only thing I could think to do was call the police. I dialed the operator and asked for the police but when they came on the line to talk to me they said because I was up the canyon I needed to talk to the sheriff. I finally got to talk to the sheriff's dept. and I told them I had a prowler. I certainly couldn't say I had a beast of some kind looking in my window. It took them about 30 to 45 minutes to show up at the house. While I waited, I sat in the dark and just listened, expecting to hear the thing crashing through the door or window at any time. I heard several of the windows along the east side of the house rattle ""softly"" and also the back door, as if someone was just testing to be sure they were secure. After that there was nothing but silence and I started to get some courage back before the sheriff showed up. By the time they got there I was back to the living room and waiting for them. They asked for a discription, and I said I couldn't see the person because they were standing on the top step next to the porch light and all I could see was a dark outline of their head and sholders in the window. One of the deputies was about my husbands height, 6'3' and he stood on the top step and the window framed only his head. They commented that my prowler must be fairly tall. There were no tracks to be found when I looked the next day, too many leaves. The porch doorway and steps at that time were built to go right along the house toward the driveway. Several years later when I went back to look at the house, someone had changed the door and stairs to go away from the house and out toward the lawn. It made me wonder if someone else had the same visitor. My husband had laughed at me at the time I told him about what had happened. I took my son and moved out about a week after that. My husband later told me that about a month or so after that he had a strange encouter early one morning. He was up getting ready for work when he heard a racket out in the porch so he went out to chase our cats out and stop the noise. As he walked toward the front door he saw a dark hairy face looking in at him through the little diamond shaped window in the door. He stoped and thought ""Bear"", and he ran into the front bedroom to put on his pants and grab his gun. By the time he got back out, he was alone again. It wasn't until later when he was thinking about it that he realised that it couldn't have been a bear because it's face was up close to the window and a bears snout would not fit close to the window like that. About a year after that, my husband moved to Eugene OR with a friend to work and he sent me a book on bigfoot with a note that said, ""I think you might like to read this, remember your visitor"".. Remember, I'll never forget, I still get the shakes when I think about it and it's been alot of years. One other note I'd like to mention; When we first moved to Wheeler canyon, we did so with another couple and they had 3 horses which they kept in a corral down by the creek. More than once, when I was there alone in the evenings I would hear the horses screeming. I'm not talking just their normal horse neigh or such, I'm talking screeming. I told Bob about it and he said ""Oh don't worry about it, either the mare is picking on one of the boys or they can sense a wild cat up in the clifs"". After my visitor, I think what the horses could sense or smell was not a wild cat. I've told this story to alot of friends and family, but never reported it to anyone involved in the study or tracking of bigfoot before. I hope that you find this of some interest, I picked your address to send it to because of your location and the fact that this took place close to where you are. I now live with my second husband in WA but most of our familys are still in the Ogden area. I don't know how long they keep police report records, especially such minor type reports but maybe they keep them forever. I have no wish for any harm to come to any bigfoot. Thinking back, I know that the one I had the privlege to see ment me no harm. However, at the time, it sure scared the heck out of me.",Weber County,Utah,Fall,yes
"This story I am going to relate happened some 15 1/2 years ago. I have never talked to anyone about it. Not even my wife, who I've been married to for almost 18 years. She is a very skeptical person, and is a hard person to convince of anything. She knows that I believe Bigfoot exists, because I have talked to her about Bigfoot before. She is just so skeptical about it, that I know she would think I was nuts if I ever told her my story. But after having visited your web site many times in the past, and seeing the new documentary on the discovery channel ""Sasquatch legend meets science"". I now feel like I would like to tell my story. I was deer hunting in the beautiful Wasatch Mountains about 4 1/2 to 5 miles east of Pineview Reservoir in the Cache National Forest. I arrived at the magpie campground around 10:00 am. As far as I could tell, I was the only one at the campground, although the campground goes a lot farther east than I was. I parked at the furthest west parking lot, and from there I crossed the bridge that takes you over the south fork of the Ogden River. After crossing the river there is a trail that goes east, and parallels the river. I followed the trail until it branches off. At that point the trail goes south through a small canyon. The day was so nice, and I was enjoying the sounds and the scenery very much. About halfway through the canyon I made a great effort to stay as quiet as I could, because I didn't want to alert anything to my presents there. The trail up the canyon goes for a ways, I can't remember how far, but then it turns and goes west. Right after it turns, everything opens up a little bit more, and there are steep slopes on either side. Not long after I made this turn, I herd this noise. It was a noise that I had never heard before. A low grunting sort of growling type of noise. But what was amazing to me about it was the immense volume of the sound. I could almost feel the volume. I'm not sure if I can put the sound into words, but it was something like ""huuuuuuurrrrruuu"". The sound was a low-pitched sound, but it would drop off even lower at the end. I stopped immediately in my tracks, and scanned the slope to my right, which was were the sound had come from. The sound continued again, but I couldn't locate the exact spot. I just stood there, and listened. The noise kept repeating, but I wasn't able to find it. So I continued on up the trail very slowly. The noise was not continuous; there were pauses of maybe a minute or two. Then I would hear the noise again. A moose was the only thing that came to mind as the source of the sound. I didn't really care to have a confrontation with a moose so I stayed on guard, as I got closer to the sound. After going a little further up the trail I herd the noise again. This time my eyes were able to lock on to the location. Up the steep slope to my right about a hundred feet up and probably 350 to 400 feet in front of me there was a growth of thick trees and brush. The noise was coming from in that spot. I felt a little bit better; at least I knew were the thing was. I was far enough away from it that I thought if I make some noise maybe it would leave. So I start stepping on branches and kicking small rocks, but it did not leave. I kept going up the trail thinking I would see it soon, but it would not show its self. Finally I was right beneath it, about a hundred feet straight below the thick covered area. I stopped at a tree below the sound, and sat there on a thick branch. I was pretty sure that what ever was up there knew I was right down below it. Then the sounds became more agitated. I was trying real hard to see into the thick covered area using my binoculars. But I could not see into it at all. Then along with the noise some tree branches in the thick area started shacking. They were shacking about 9 or 10 feet up off the ground. I then thought o.k. here it comes. But it still wouldn't come out. I started to feel a little uneasy. I just knew that I was being watched, and what ever was watching me did not want me there. The noise started to intensify ever more. I just could not believe the lung capacity this thing had. The noise was immense. Then I really became unnerved when two rocks, about the size of basketballs came rolling out of the thick cover, down towards me. That's all I needed. I got back up and immediately headed out the way I had come. I didn't run or do anything to cause a disturbance. I just walked out as calmly and quickly as I could. I kept checking my back though to make sure I was not being followed. I could still here the noise until I got back around the bend in the trail. As soon as I got around the corner, my anxieties and fears left, And I felt all right again. I just knew that what ever I heard wanted me to leave. I was only too happy to oblige. I have hunted and fished by myself for years, and felt very comfortable by myself in those situations. But I have never heard anything at all like what I heard that day. I still don't know what was in that thick area of tree and brush growth, and I'm not sure if you will find this at all interesting. But I have read accounts where a Bigfoot would remain hid while being looked at, or while it is looking at someone. Well this was a lot of years ago, and I know that's its nothing that can be checked out now. But maybe it would help with research. Thank you for your time.",Weber County,Utah,Fall,no
"It happened one night when my brother in law and my sister had to take me home from a date because I got grounded and we drove my date home over North Ogden divide and then on our way back over the divide to Eden. As we just went over the top I noticed that there were no cars in the parking lot. It was 12:30 a.m. and dark.  As we went another 100-200 yards down the valley side we noticed a person crossing the road, but as we got closer we could tell it was not a person but it was about 7 to 8 ft tall and hairy. By the time we were to pass it my brother-in-law rolled down his window and yelled ""get out of the road!"" my sister asked what do you think that was and my brother in-law said ""it was probably some kid dressed in a gorilla suit"" but as we thought about it, it did not make sense because there were no cars and there was no where to park other than the top. And after we yelled at it, it just walked up into the mountains. I know that I saw something that was about 8 ft tall very dark and hairy my only conclusion is that it was bigfoot",Weber County,Utah,Fall,yes
"The sighting happened during the bow hunting season in Utah. I liked to hunt the area because of the relative isolation and the numerous deer. I had been hiking around the area of what is know as: Six-Bit Springs. I did start out in a general direction but wove around so much that I did not really know where I was (it would be hard for me to point it out on a map). The first strange thing I noticed was the absence of large game, it is usally a game highway in that part of the woods. As I was wandering, getting totally lost, I noticed a reeking smell and decided to scout out the source (I was curious if a hunter had lost or shot deer or elk during the hunt and wanted to see what it was). I would catch whiffs of the smell here and there and it led me to a sort of clearing. The area looked like a dried out pond. The grass was greener in this area and compared to the woods the only area that had bright sunlight. I scanned the general area and nothing really caught my eye except for what I thought was a large tree stump almost in the middle of the pond (about 25-35 yards from where I was standing in the trees). As I was walking back up the slope the smell hit me again and it was coming from the pond area. I looked again and stared at what I thought was a tree stump, it was black, like it had been burned by lighting or fire. The shape was odd, it was roughly pear shaped and contoured,no jagged edges like broken piece of wood, it looked like a large person wrapped in a dark shawl sitting with their back to you. In this sitting position it might have been about 4 feet tall. As I stared at it I decided it was only a burned tree stump that had weathered smooth edges, but as I watched it listed to one side. It was then I thought it might be a black cow or a moose laying with it's back to me. As I watched, it would shift back and forth like someone getting comfortable in their seat. I also noticed the grasses in front of this thing moving as though they were being disturbed. It seemed to be very intent on what it was doing. I became scared at this point and hurried back up the slope and after many wrong turns here and there I made my way back to camp about 4:00-4:30PM. The only other strange thing that happened was the large dog we always took camping and hunting was very jumpy and nervious, and would run off into the wooded areas by our camp for no apparent reason and would stare and fixate on the woods for very long peroids of time. The reason I mention this is that this same dog has been on these trips numerous times and he has never acted this way. Needless to say we left at the crack of dawn the next morning and I have not been back to the site since then. I don't know if this story is worth keeping because I could not guarantee that it was not a cow or moose although being familiar with cows and seeing moose often, I strongly doubt that it was either of these.",Weber County,Utah,Fall,yes
"I don't know if this counts, but I talked to my grandfather the other day and he said he had gone up to our property in Monte Cristo. It was kind of late in the day, around 7 p.m. He usually does a perimeter walk of the property when he gets there and on this particular occasion, he had stopped down by the creek. He said he smelled this horrible smell that he had never smelled before. He described it as rotten meat and really bad B.O. He searched around the area and didn't see any tracks because the ground was really rocky. Where he was at, there is a big tree that has fallen over the creek. It's big enough for two people to walk over side by side. My grandfather hopped up on the tree and he said there were droppings right in the middle of it. He said he thought it might be elk droppings, but thought how on earth would an elk get up on this tree. When he told me the story, I told him that there was a bigfoot in his vicinity, that's where the smell was coming from. I read a lot of articles and a lot of people describe almost the same kind of smell. He also stated that our apple tree at the property doesn't have any apples on it anymore, and there are no chokecherries to be seen anymore. We usually have lots of apples and chokecherries. The deer and elk never eat them all. And the only apples they eat are the one's that fall on the ground. The rest are to high up the tree for them to get to. It would even be hard for a full grown moose to get the apples from the tree.",Weber County,Utah,Fall,no
"At approximately 10 pm one night, my wife and I returned home from a shopping trip. Upon opening the car door and stepping into the gravel driveway I heard a distinct and loud vocalization. It wasn't a howl, not a growl, nothing I had heard before which is what caught my attention. At 31 years old now, 28 then, I had spent my life in the outdoors, locally and abroad. I have never heard anything to match this. My wife asked me what it was and I had to admit I didn't know, but perhaps it was a big cat. But it didn't sound like a cat, and the only cats in the area that are known as 'big' would be bobcats, a big one being 18-29 lbs. I walked inside the house, cutting on the rear porch light, and walked through the house to the front deck where I walked back outside, cutting on the front deck light. I stood at the end of the deck facing east and listened intently. The 'cries' were coming from a ridge in a large woodlot across the railroad tracks behind our house. Our house is situated on 10 acres, and the rear property boundary is the railroad. At that time the nearest house to us, a couple of hundred yards to the east was uninhabited, but the next houses up and across the railroad tracks were. Between cries, I realized I could hear leaves rustling loudly as though two feet were shuffling through them in large strides. When the leaves stopped making noise, an agitated cry was heard. This went on for a minute or two, then the noises came from closer to the neighboring houses, then it started going in the other direction. I probably listened for ten minutes total, until could no longer hear the leaves moving, and howls were coming from farther away. It was mid fall and cold, the sky was clear, no traffic on the road in front of my house which intersects with the railroad maybe a quarter mile down the road. I have labored under the impression that the cries came from some kind of cat, but after listening to the Ohio recording, the cries I heard were frightfully akin to the howls on that recording. They were shorter and sounded more agitated as though something was making the 'issuer' of the cries mad. The large woodlot across the tracks is semi-surrounded by a loose assortment of houses in a neighborhood, which could be easily walked through unseen in the dark. Everything else for surrounding areas is farm pasture and mountain, in fact one mile from my house to the east starts a gravel road running across a mountain into the next county. My inside dogs were whining and agitated, but never offered to bark, then, they rarely do. However neighborhood dogs could be heard barking in the distance, beagles I know for sure and a German Shepherd.",Wythe County,Virginia,Fall,no
"I was fishing behind the fish hatchery in Ft. Chiswell my friend and me where coming out at dusk when it was getting dark I said, ""we need to go I don't want to be out here at night"" so we were walking down the trail so we get out of the forest, I was feeling very weird at this time because something didn't feel right to me it felt like someone was following as you already know you can tell if someone or something is looking at you, so I let my friend out of the tree line first because I always do that and when I was coming out I heard a crash in the woods it sounded like something crashed down from the tree I turn around and saw a dark figure standing in the trail we just got off of, my friend was 30 ft in front of me when he heard the thing that was in the woods he ran. I was brisk fully walking backwards and pulled my knife out I was in fear for my life from what I saw whatever it was stood I say around 7 to 8 ft tall I only saw the silhouette of it it was very tall and very broad across the shoulders, I saw it for about 3 to 4 seconds and ran to my left with incredible speed and I ran to the truck in fear for my life. On a later incident I was carp fishing near the river behind the fish hatchery again, I had 2 other friends with me I will not mention any of my friends names because they don't want to be included in what happened, and something threw what I believe was a rock at us I was scared but we left a few hours later because I was getting worried.",Wythe County,Virginia,Summer,no
"My wife and I were driving around and we were on a back road out in Wytheville, Virginia on queens knob road. It was dark out, not too late but it was dark and as we turned a corner my wife and I saw something in the middle of the road. It was about 4 foot tall and COVERED in fur. It was NOT a dog or any 4-legged animal. It was on 2 legs and it saw our car and ran and jumped over the fence towards the left like it was nothing. It pumped its arms as it ran and then jumped over the fence without using any effort at all. It then proceeded to run through the field with the sheep and we lost sight of it. My wife and I both talked about what we saw and we both had no doubts in our minds.",Wythe County,Virginia,Spring,yes
"I research mountain lions in NH, but I was caring for my mother and hadn't gotten out since Christmas Day, 2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk, no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill, but was determined to at least make it to the power line. I did, but when I turned back to go down to the car, I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them, the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck's feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long, but it was hard to tell with all the leaves, unevenness, grass, etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree, above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road, so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down. Going back to the car, I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches, but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn't take a photo. Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought, ""That's what that was!"" It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead, so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn't enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). The casts are awful. There were too many leaves, the toes broke off, etc. The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a ""Yeah, we get lots of reports of bigfoots, but we try to keep it on the down low."" When I asked him about mountain lion sightings, he seemed scared and said, ""You think there are mountain lions up there?"" It was odd that bigfoot was ""normal"" and mountain lions were ""strange""! When I came back, I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion. Part of his job is to clear the trails and make sure everyone is off the mountain. That night it got dark, and he was also ""helped"" off the mountain, though ""it"" always stayed the same distance behind him.",Windsor County,Vermont,Spring,no
"My mother related the story to me in 1969.  I remember it clearly. ""Your father and I had gone to Mt. Adams to picknick and enjoy his new Ford. We had driven some miles up into the hills when we found a partial clearing where we could park and enjoy ourselves. This was when we were engaged in 1941 and were just graduated from Grandview High School in Grandview, Washington. We stayed for part of the day at that spot. In the afternoon we had decided to leave. We had packed up and loaded the Ford with our stuff and were turning out of the clearing to go back to Grandview. As we were leaving I turned to see if we had left anything behind us and noticed something black moving in the clearing next to where we had parked. What I saw was a tall black creature covered with hair and very muscular walking quickly across the clearing parallel to us towards the forest. I said to your father, 'Look, whats that,' and pointed behind him at the creature. He slowed the car back down and looking where I pointed he said he didn't see anything. By the time he had slowed the car and looked the creature had dissapeared into the forest. I was the only one that saw it. When I told him what I had seen he said it was only a bear looking for berries to eat probably. I didn't want to argue with him as we were close to getting married and I didn't want to ruin a great outing and throw cold water on what had been a beautiful trip.",Yakima County,Washington,Fall,yes
"Laurie Durrell Duyck by way of Linda Durrell My two daughters and I were driving in to Yakima from our home in Naches. The road runs along the Naches River. Looking down at the river, as I always do to see deer or Bald Eagles, I saw a large dark figure at the edge of the water behind some bushes. Slamming on my brakes and backing up far enough to see the river again, the large figure was gone and no where to be seen. Of course my kids said, ""Sure Mom, Bigfoot...I don't think so"". About 2 weeks later I was driving on the same road coming home from Yakima in the evening. About a half mile from where I thought I had seen the other one, there were two standing side by side just looking down at the water. One was about a foot and a half taller than the other, both dark in color with very wide shoulders. And again by the time I stopped and backed up, there was nothing to be seen.",Yakima County,Washington,Summer,yes
"I will begin by saying that I am an avid extreme hunter and outdoorsman as is my companion on this trip.  We have hunted together for many years through all sorts of terrain and conditions, and have developed a certain uncanny sense for each other and the mountain. Normally I would not entertain writing this, but I have again been awaken by the re-occuring dream/nightmare of this mis-adventure.  The incident began after some brutal unsuccessful elk hunting on the Bethal Ridge above the Oak creek.  We are both local and know the mountain better than most. We decided to head over to the Cowiche were I had tagged a nice young bull the year before. The area supports a fair local herd and is extremely rugged. We had access to an area through a friend that owned some property and lived a very primitive lifestyle up there. Frank is his name and being a little eccentric his tales of bigfoot and not being caught on Divide ridge after dark were scoffed at by myself and hunting partner Justin. Anyway, we headed straight up the ridge in my hunting rig in late afternoon to pitch camp. We encountered three other rigs coming back down as the sun was setting. They were driving at a high rate of speed. I new one of the guys, he's a logger up there, and he stopped to warn us of the Divide Ridge after dark deal. I said thanks, see ya, and he proceeded back down the mountain, fast. Justin commented about being a bunch of wimps. We found a fair sight to spend the night. As some weather was coming in, we picked the heavily wooded very dense north slope to put out our bedrolls. The place had an eerie feel to it and I dismissed it as being in my head. We were gathering wood by flashlight for a fire when we both stopped and simultanously looked at each other. ""You smell that?"" ""Yeh, it's probably a couger kill"". A very strong rancid odor, not like rotting meat decay, just a putrid smell. We got a fire going and I put on a pot of venison chili. Justin started building the fire bigger and bigger. This was uncommon for him. I asked him. He stated ""something ain't right up hear tonight"" and I said I agree. We both know fear feeds on fear and dismissed it at that. Then we heard the first whistle/howl. The first one was distant and we could here clearly due to no wind and the cold. When elk call each other, people not familier with wapiti can mis-interpret these calls as whistles. This was no elk. Justin got out his cow elk call and responded with a short set of chirps. I got out my Weatherby and .44 Magnum. Something was not right. There was no initial response to Justin's cow calls. I put some more wood on the fire. Then came the second shrill howl, in the creek bottom right below us. It was loud and like nothing else we have ever heard and believe me when I tell you we have hunted every manner of ""known"" species in these mountains. My hair was literally standing on end. Justin said ""we're outta here right now, cover me, I'm pitching camp"". He started packing tarps and gear while I sat listening and watching, heavily armed. Justin is one of the most fearless men I have ever met. He was white with fear. Next thing we heard was feet walking in the snow, very loud crunching. Justin just about knocked me over getting to my rifle. The scarey part is, we have crashed enough hooved ungulates through the woods to know the sound of four legs crunching snow. This was very deliberate walking, not crashing or running. I screamed out that we were locked and loaded and who ever is out there to come into the light, hoping someone would. The crunching snow stopped. Now both Justin and I are very seasoned and responsible hunters and probably the last ones to shoot at noises in the dark, but this had gone far beyond that. There was something standing out there in the dark, large and not scared of us, which for any manner of ""known"" species in our mountains is unusual.  This silent standoff went on for about two minutes. We could see nothing outside the light of the fire and lanterns. Now mind you this creature was close enough that we could hear it walking in the snow, so we knew it was still there, but there was no smell. I called out one more time and we fired one shot from my pistol into the air. Then all hell broke lose. There was a loud short grunt and running feet crunching in the snow, and we started firing reloading and firing. We did not stop shooting till we were loaded and well on our way. After a harrowing drive off the mountain at night in the snow, which I do not reccommend to even experienced drivers, we made it back to the my ranch. My wife took one look at us and knew something was truely wrong. Justin refused to talk the whole drive off the mountain. And to this day refuses to talk about it. I have no desire to go back up Divide Ridge to investigate. It is 3:00 A.M. and I'm am writing this after I was awaken again by this same incident. I am still an avid hunter, but I stick to Bethal Ridge. Make no mistake, this incident has changed my perspective. I would encourage anyone interested in this to spend some time on Divide Ridge, good luck.",Yakima County,Washington,Fall,no
We showed up and set up camp around 5:00pm. Started the fire and around 9:00pm the noises followed shortly therafter. We heard the noise about a half mile away and it progressevly got louder. It was still getting darker when we heard the noises and we saw a bird flying overhead and swooping down and then the noise was heard. We are all pretty sure that the noise was not bear or elk. It sounded like a schreech howl grunt. We heard the noise again the next day around the same time.,Yakima County,Washington,Summer,no
"While on a family camping trip this summer, my husband, our two teenage boys, and our two Newfoundland dogs headed out towards Naches where my husband often hunts. We don't like ""organized"" camping, so we headed towards Bumping Lake in the Mt Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest. We had got a late start, and arrived at the lake about 8:00 pm. We continued on past the camping area at the dam about 4 or 5 miles towards the ""Deep Creek"" area, hoping for a secluded camping spot by the lake. We turned off on a four-wheel drive trail about a mile from Deep Creek. Found a campsite next to a swamp, and as it was getting late and almost dark, we decided to camp. After setting up camp, about 10:00 pm, our dogs went absolutely nuts, barking and very excited...a few minutes later, a car arrived looking for a camp site, but turned and left. The dogs definitly heard this car well before we did, and did their job annoucing the presence of this ""intruder."" We fired up the campfire and ate a late dinner, while getting comfortable with our surroundings. It was a mild night, it had been hot and dry for some time. About midnight our two boys headed off to bed. Our big male Newfoundland was chained to a tree about 5 yards away from the campsite. Our female Newf was at our feet, as usual. It was extremely quite where we were. My husband and I were sitting by the campfire relaxing when, out of the swamp beside us, not more than 100 to 200 feet away came a noise, a screem or a grunt that changed pitch to a screech and then ended in a grunt-huffing sound, lasting a long time. The dogs had not reacted at all until they heard this scream, when they went wild. My husband is a logger and advide hunter-outdoorsman, so I turned to him and asked ""what was that?"" From the look of his eyes and on his face, I knew that he did not know what it was. He has heard the voices of about every animal in the Pacific Northwest at some time in 30 plus years of being in the woods. Our oldest son came out of the tent and asked if ""someone was messing with us."" He thought it sounded very human-like. Please remember that there was absolutely no noise, ie sticks or brush breaking or moving prior to the scream, and the dogs didn't detect anything around us, and they were extremely on edge in their new surroundings. We got the dogs settled down and began discussing possibilities of what was out there. All was quite about 15 minutes later, when we heard what sounded like two sticks being hit together about 100 yards north of the original scream. The dogs once again went nuts. About another 15 minutes went by when we heard this same noise of sticks being hit together, this time farther away, about 300 yards north and the dogs once again did their thing. Whatever it was had moved silently through the brush in the swamp, apparently downwind from us as the dogs detected no movement between the noises. About an hour later we found ourselves in the middle of a dry-lighting storm and heard no more unusal sounds. The following morning my husband and sons went on a search of the area and found no tracks or broken brush around the swamp. We promptly packed up and moved to Deep Creek!",Yakima County,Washington,Summer,no
"My nephew, his girlfriend and I were camping at the Bumping Lake camp grounds adjacent to the boat launch. It was about 10:30pm and we had just finished cleaning up after dinner. All of us goofed off for awhile running through the dark woods with flashlights, just exploring. After getting our fill of that, we built a fire in our fire-pit and were just relaxing and talking. Suddenly, we heard a horrific scream coming from behind us on what I think was Nelson Ridge. It was a long, high-pitched bellow that instantly caught our attention. The scream was a classic sasquatch scream, trying to catch the attention of another. About 15 seconds later, we heard another roar come back from down-range from what I think was Miners Ridge. We were all petrified and instantly knew what it was. Things settled down and we ended up going to bed. My nephew and I were up, decidedly exited about what we heard. We were laying in our tent, just talking. Suddenly, we heard another scream. Both of us grabbed our hand-guns at that point. We weren't sure what was going to happen. Eventually we fell asleep and nothing else happened. We are planning a trip back to Bumping Lake, specifically to look for what we heard.",Yakima County,Washington,Summer,no
"First of all I don't know if this incident is a big deal or not, but I been a outdoorsman for many years and it kind of caught my attention. I was Elk hunting in the Bumping river area of Yakima County. I was walking up the American ridge trail in the am Hours. I had reached a portion of the the trail that was flat and had soft dirt. I noticed a foot print on the trail. My first thought was why would someone walk barefooted up on the mountain. The track was not large. It looked like a slender womans foot print. I followed the track up the trail for about six to eight feet and I then lost sight of the track. I continued walking and I heard a wierd whistling sound. It wasn't real loud, but I definetly didn't recognize it. I started to put things together in my mind (Track/Whistle) and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I continued up the trail and eventually sat down to watch a draw for any elk that may be crossing. I again heard the whistling sound. I have been hunting in this exact area since about 1977 including other places and I don't recall hearing a similair sound. Looking back now, It seems even more strange that if the foot print was in fact a person that had taken off their shoes to fix their socks or whatever, why would they walk up the trail, especially in late October?",Yakima County,Washington,Winter,no
June 11th. 6:00 pm. Witnessed large creature crossing road north of Glewood on Yakima Indian Reservation returning from the K 1400 raft launch on the Klickitat river. Headed from north to south possibly enroute to Bird Creek.,Yakima County,Washington,Summer,yes
"Elk Camp 2001 . . . VERY LOUD and LONG VOLCALIZATIONS! The night before the incident, I aimed my 2,000,000 candle power spotlight to the cliffs and caves above the camp. As usual the relatives were around the campfire till late at night (1:00 a.m.) cracking jokes and making the most racket around, long after other area camps shut off their noisy generators. Believed this attracted it's couriousity. The relatives (3) who witnessed the sounds are very experienced outdoorsmen. One worked in the Northwest woods as a surveyor and has been chased by bears a couple of times (One time his co-worker had his pack ripped from his back as they ran) and all three know the sounds animals make. What they heard was NOT something like a Bear or Cougar! They are braver than most, not easily frightened by anyone or anything! The night of the incident was quiet and cold . . . about 2:30 a.m. one relative went outside the tent to relieve himself. As usual, he shined his flashlight around the perimeter of the camp. As the light beam went close to the creature, it let out a VERY LOUD and LONG Volcalization as it ran through the dense timber. The noise was very intense and continious without breaking branches along the way and again 3/4 mile up the high ridge. It seemed to be mad for almost being spotted and made the sound as it ran as though it was without effort. Comparable to a kids loud car stereo turned on with the volume already up and was steady for 10 - 12 seconds. The second time up the ridge could have been from another creature but sounded like the same one. It would have easily beaten any person up the heavily timbered and steep ridge. It was defenetly NOT any known animal like a Bear bellaring as it ran or a cougar. The noise was so loud it woke up three camps about 1/4 mile apart. The relatives left a gas lantern on until it burned out each night afterwards and they went out with a loaded gun or second person with their loaded gun. None of them will EVER sleep on the ground again! That week of hard hunting, the 14 other hunters in the area didn't see any Elk or Deer. Also did not hear any coyotes! Seemed like everthing was frightened away, very unusual. There was no sign in the hard frozen ground or up the high ridge the next day.",Yakima County,Washington,Fall,no
when i was a kid we lived out side of yakima out in the country by parker a little town out side of yakima . Near the yakima river matter of fact we were so close to the river that in the spring when the river rose we had to move the animals an go into town .the woods were thick we had a pig pen it was a long ways away from the house really thickly wooded. all the time we lived there you wood hear shrill whistling whistling in the bushes at this time we were maybe ten years old never heard of bigfoot before im 48 years old now so it was long ago.It was in the ninteen sixtys way before roger patterson nobody knew about bigfoot . Well anyway us kids were sent into the woods to feed the cows at the big pond . We had two cows we had a little wagon with a bail of hay on it .We left it there for them to eat we left and stopped by the river to talk. Four of us kids we were all looking the same way when all of a sudden 30 feet away something something stepped from the clearing in full view of us took one step maybe six feet an dissapeared behind a bush it was id say eight feet tall hairy it took one step and was gone .We alllooked at each other an ran home nobody beleived us the said it may have been a hunter or something . that was the end of it . It was years later that i learned what it really was .I was 40 years old looking in a library when i saw something about it and what i read told of sightings of bigfoot in the same place where we lived the same years we lived there. It didnt try to chase us we were kids it could have caught us easily but i think it was just watching us . I also reamember my aunt going to kook for us kids at anoughter time at the pig pen we came home anighter way she came running up out of breath she heard a loud whistle behind her in the bushes i remmber hearing those all the time even in the daytime they were so shrill. Once my aunt was alone at the house at night she came out side to get into the car to pick us up in town she herd the shrill whistle behind her next to the house she tore out out of there so fast she drove right therw the loced fence. all of this is true he does exist i saw him . I have other stories to tell im half indian i spent my whole life in the yakima valley.,Yakima County,Washington,Summer,yes
I was traveling west on road 1502 (which is graveled) looking for a campsite for bow season. I glanced in my rearview mirror and saw a very large upright creature step to the middle of the road. I immediatly slowed down and quickly glanced around for a safe spot to pull over and there wasn't one I looked back over my shoulder through my canopy window and saw that the creature was still standing in the middle of the road. There was still a lot of dust in the air from where I had passed and all I could make out was that What I was looking at was very tall maybe (7 to 8 feet) and broad it also was very dark in color. The arms appeared to be held out slightly from the sides and reached to about mid thigh. when I reached a full stop the creature seemed to pivot on its left leg while swinging its arms turned to the left and took one step to the opposite side of the road and disapeared from view. When I looked at the area where it crossed I was unable to discern any tracks in the gravel that I could definately say were footprints. The area where the creature went off the road is very steep and rocky. I would not want to try going down it without ropes and I doubt if what I saw was another hunter out scouting since the hill ends in a cliff just a few hundred yards down.,Yakima County,Washington,Fall,yes
"First off I am not a true beliver in BigFoot.  I was messing around on the internet and stumbled apon your site.  I thought it would be funny to see what sightings have happend around my home city of Yakima Washington.  When I clicked on the report form of the July 2000 (class B) hearing sound around bumping lake, I got the chills.  Let me start from the begining.  Myself and a couple of buddies of mine took off from Yakima really late with the intent of climbing the trail and spending 3 days of camping at Twin Sisters. We were going to stay at the first lake (Or First Sister).  The lake is about 8 or 9 miles past bumping lake and you have to hike in about 1-1.25 miles straight up. When we arrived at the lake after taking way to long to climb the trail (Over confident and over packed) we set up came and got the fire going by 12:30am-1:00am.  We were exhausted and really didn't feel like drinking or anything else but eating and going to bed.  About two hours after going to bed I was awoken by some little grunting sounds.  I woke up kind of starteld but then realized they were basically a quarter the way around the lake so I just sat and listened.  All of a sudden they turned from little gruntings to a grunt/scream.  I quietly called out my friends Shawns name and he had been woken up and was listening to.  I asked him what the hell that was and after talking about it we both convinced ourselves that it was an elk or something.  I am not an animal call expert by any means but to this day when I think about that trip one of the first things I think about is how weird that sounded.  I have heard elk and deer grunts before but this sounded different. As Ron White would say ""I told you that story so I could tell you this one."" On the last night I slow cooked some stakes over the fire coals for about.  When they were done my friends and I were enjoying them when were heard something about 60 or 70 yards out from camp.  We were camped out below the rocky base of the mountain top.  Its like the dirt stops and the rocks go up the rest of the way.  The sound was coming from the rocky area but we all thought it was a cat or bear so we got up grabbed the guns and an axe and started out with a lantern to go see what the hell was out there.  The sound was like what a rock being thrown and hitting the other rocks and then coming to rest.  It didn't sound like a little rock slide and it happen several times until we got closer, infact we had barehanded our stakes and finished them while we were away from camp as close to the sounds as we could get without climbing the rocky face, they completely stopped.  At no time did we every think it was bigfoot but we couldn't figure out what would make a sound like that?  It didn't sound like an animal that was mearly passing by, it moved to quick and to speratic(as if someone was throwing at different targets.  The only reason I look back on it now is that I was watching a bigfoot special today on the history channel and they had a gentlemen on there saying bigfoot was throwing rocks at him.  And now looking back I could definatley see how someone or something throwing a rock down twords us could make that sound.  Were the activity was would be the exact place I would be if I wanted to mess with my buddies back at camp.  We always talk about those noises and never ever gave bigfoot a chance of being the sorce of the sounds and now I just don't know.  After all this time of not even considering it now that I think of that as a possiblity it makes more and more sence even though I don't truely believe in Bigfoot.",Yakima County,Washington,Summer,no
"It happened close to midnight on August 18, 2007, on the last official night of a private expedition, east of Mt. Rainier in the Wenatchee National Forest, of Washington State. Out of respect for our WA-BFRO crew's primary Central Washington State research area, I've purposely withheld the exact location and am using ""Chinook Pass,"" which covers a broad general area. The event was both a weekend social gathering as well as a field expedition with one main base camp and several satellite camps over a 10-mile area. The area (which I initially felt was very dry aside from several marshy areas nearby, contained a tremendous amount of elk sign) has been used for a previous BFRO expedition as well as other private outings. It's been a consistent “hot zone” for our WA crew, who, lacking sophisticated heat-sensing equipment, have experienced a lot of curious activity over the years including purported vocalizations, wood-knocking, powerful footfalls, branch breaking, persons being paralleled, etc. and several documented sightings nearby within the BFRO database. In attendance were various members of both WABFR (Washington Bigfoot Field Research Group) & a majority of WA-BFRO researchers. A few of us CA-BFRO members were invited and held the furthest base camp from the main camp & shared that particular site with various WA bigfooters. A matter of fact, on any given night our camp held about 14-15 people with many walking back and forth only on the primary dirt road to the closest adjacent camp about one mile away. During the first two nights, there was no activity to report from my perspective other then some of the best barred owl vocalizations I've ever heard in my years in the field. For most of that Saturday, August 18th, I spent the day in Seattle with my friend Jamie J, picking up his son and we returned to the camp location around 5:30 PM. At around 11:00 PM our site held about 13-14 people (most of them researchers) who were consolidated in one small area. Everyone was congregated into this section of the camp that was bordered by vegetation on the backside in which there was a berm and trail running parallel right behind that vegetative border. Being a little antsy and not much in a socializing mood, I took a walk down that back pathway about 100 yds, (which was pitch black on a dark night with plenty of tree cover) to relieve myself. 30-40 yards further down that pathway the trail led to a swampy marsh & was broken up by denser vegetation & ponderosa pine (see map picture for camp layout). In the middle of urinating I was facing towards camp and heard a very close step-branch break at my eight-a-clock, 6-7 yds from me that did not give me the immediate impression a large subject was responsible. Casually walking back to camp and not hearing anything further, I asked one of my best friends & research partner, former BFRO researcher Cliff B., if I could borrow his X200xp handheld thermal imaging unit to scout around camp & see if I could see the subject responsible for the branch break on the pathway I'd just returned from. He immediately obliged and we walked to his truck, which was located about 30 yds behind the current congregated area in the opposite direction of that same pathway. When I received it, I immediately walked to the front of that pathway near where our tent was placed perpendicular to the trail and my companions congregation area was to my left about 20 yds in front of me down a small berm. As I could hear Cliff reshuffling equipment around the back of his truck, I put the imager to my eye to tune it and while doing so caught a glimpse of a small wood rat running 10 yds in front of me to the right. Straight ahead, I caught the heat signature of what I initially thought was a person standing behind a tree, beyond my party where it was pitch black. My initial impression did not change for about 20 seconds with the combination of only seeing about 10-15% of the subject. (partial legs, arms, knee & head were contrasted behind that biggest tree in view: see re-creation pic # 2) The subject then began to move its head right to left behind the tree repeatedly as if to possibly discern me or my presence more clearly. It then stepped out in plain view and dropped to ""all fours"" positioning, (see re-creation pic #3) looking over its left shoulder rotating its head in my direction as if to ""lock-in"" with arms fully extended and knees down. The second when it stepped out before dropping, the realization of what the subject was hit me and my reaction was a ""surreal"" shock considering the unexpected circumstances. When on the ground, the subject transitioned very rapidly to where it appeared it was now full body down favoring its right shoulder, rapidly moving and appeared to actually be inching up away from the tree it was initially behind & into a bit of a clearing from my perspective view. Knowing that the thermal unit I had was not self-recordable like a camcorder (at that time, to record video, our set-up was a back-pack attached to your front side containing a mini-DVR, connecting battery with plug-ins and helmet mount for the imager) I began snapping my fingers whispering loud ""Cliff,"" ""Cliff"" as I could hear Cliff repacking his truck about 30-35 yards behind me at a seven-a-clock position- back left. As I did that, the subject, who was grounded, still leaning off the right shoulder, began an almost unnerved & panicked, full-body convulsive movement obviously reactionary to the sound of my snapping fingers and voice (see re-creation pic #5). Oddly enough, it would pause-freeze in between those intervals and I was blown away that it appeared to react to my minimal sound, while my party (almost halfway between our line of site) was making a considerable amount of noise with conversing & acoustic guitar-playing. Cliff never responded in my cautious 5-6 attempts to get his attention and the subject further transitioned on the ground into what appeared to be a ""breaststroke"" uniformed-like motion (see re-creation pics #6 & #7). ""It"" was on its knees, head straight, facing toward a nine-o-clock position from my point of view, slightly down, back straight with clear space in between front torso and ground and violently swinging back what appeared to be both arms in a stroke-like motion. The hand positioning from my view (looking at the left arm) appeared to be positioned as if having four fingers held tight together and a thumb spaced away or extended, but I'm not absolutely certain. I could clearly see the subject repeat this movement 3-4 times and it appeared as if the large upper-body was being held up by the subject's abdominal muscles by the positioning and vertical space between the upper torso and ground. From this position, the subject got back down completely on the ground on its right shoulder and held an open hand above its face (facing me) as if ""blocking the sun from its eyes."" (see re-creation pics #8 & #9) I could even make out pretty clearly, five spread digits on the left hand up by its face. From this positioning the very agile subject appeared to ""pop-up"" from the ground clearly using no arms and quickly backed behind the initial tree I first witnessed it from. Again it looked at me right to left with its alternating head on both sides of the tree before dropping right back to the ground behind that same tree. It immediately came back up with what appeared to be the benefit of one arm which I believe was its right (am not certain because of how quickly it got up). Within seconds, it had quickly moved a few feet further back in the clear with its back clearly to me and what looked like the left leg slightly forward (see re-creation pics #10 & #11) and remained completely motionless for the next 40-45 seconds or so. Now I could clearly see the full profile of the subject (estimate about 90%) from about just below the calves up. Remarkably, I do not recall actually seeing its feet from my vantage point during the entire encounter. I can remember just repeating to myself under my breath, over and over, ""Oh my god, oh my god, I can't believe it's really happening, right now."" Its appearance (even with a white thermal profile) was absolutely remarkable & distinct with uneven weight distribution. The subject appeared to clearly possess about 2/3rds of its body weight in the upper extremities. It was obvious that the subject was predominantly bipedal by its build, though its movements on the ground just prior appeared agile, fluid and effortless. The subject's legs were fairly long but not particularly bulky in relationship to the massive torso above the waist as the bulk appeared from the waist up into just these massive shoulders & traps with no visible neck and what appeared to be from behind-- a smallish-rounder head (no discernable sagittal crest). The arm length was astonishing in that they looked ""exaggerated"" and appeared to hang as low as the subjects knees and possibly even further. A matter of fact, my guess would have its fingertips if completely extended (large hands seemed almost fisted) reach mid-to top calves. That impression was slightly thrown off a bit by the discovery the next day in daylight where it appeared the left foot had stepped over a small foot deep berm (while subject's back to me) just beyond the 10-15 yard window the subject stayed in during the whole encounter. The physical impression beyond that small berm, visually appeared to match the distance the subject was from me the night before and was also in wet thick pine-needle duff after raining all night. After about 40-45 seconds of just staring at this basically, glowing live ""statue,"" I had an extremely difficult decision to make--either continue watching the subject until it departs or attempt to document it by taking the imager from my eye, run back and notify Cliff to set-up for recording capability while praying the subject wouldn't leave in the process. I chose the latter, and it was one of the most difficult but unregrettable things I've done in my life. The last image I have of this subject was seeing it in that ""departing"" position (never saw it leave or even move again, just stood there glowing through the imager). I immediately ran towards Cliff, who was still at the back of his truck and was just screaming at him words I don't recall but must have been obvious as he moved very quickly in what I needed him to do. To my chagrin, looking back from where I came, the guitar playing had stopped and I could here a variety of scattering voices from my party and movement, including two people with headlamps on totally oblivious to what was happening, while walking up the small berm and into the line of sight between where I stood opposed to the subject during the encounter. In a panic, and without much of an explanation other then ""I just saw one, get back,"" I attempted to pull everybody back into the congregation area and continue with what they were doing minutes earlier. I had to physically pull some people back who began curiously looking down that pathway behind the congregation area. I knew Cliff was moving quickly and within minutes, saw him fully geared, running quickly back down the path towards where I last witnessed the subject standing. For the few minutes he was back there, my heart was racing from adrenalin & I was still cautiously optimistic Cliff would maybe catch the subject loitering or even departing. Unfortunately, after about 5 minutes he came back & looked at me shaking his head. About an hour later, close to 1:00 AM, Paul G. (WA-BFRO), walked back to the spot so we could interpret actual distance of the subject from my positioning during the encounter. As I saw him walk back to the initial tree it was behind, I yelled, ""stop,"" and he estimated the distance using his own steps at about 150 ft (50 yds). (After returning to this exact area the weekend of September 17-20th 2009, through exact measurement we determined that I first witnessed the subject at around 50 yds with a slight right to left angle, but worked my way up to only 33 yds from the subject with a line of sight from right to left-opposite ends of pathway). Seeing him stand there made my jaw drop as I know Paul is 6'3 & 170lbs, and it was a shock to see him ""fully clothed"" & realize the size discrepancy between both he and the subject. I'd estimate the subject at 4-7 inches taller, but even conservatively estimating its size in comparison, it was about 3 times the total body mass of Paul G. Even with the depth perception issue of this particular proprietary unit I was experienced with, I knew the subject was big once it was in the clear with its back to me, but was shocked how much thicker and oddly proportioned it was compared to Paul. I've always been great estimating people's height and poor estimating people's weight, but by comparing Paul within one hour after and the encounter so fresh in my mind, I'd estimate the subject I saw as being close to 7 ft (maybe 6'9 or 6'8) and between 475, to as much as 575 lbs. As I said earlier, the next day in daylight, what looked like a foot impression dug into heavy, wet duff was first noticed by Jamie J. and looked to be about where the subject had its back to me and left leg slightly forward. Except for the placement, it was unimpressive. Although there was heavy overnight rain, Jamie also found where the ground had been disturbed in several places where the subject had been transitioning on the ground. All of this surface was non-conducive substrate for any kind of attempted casting however and made up of wet, rain-soaked, pine needles. (to see the type of ground cover & me reenacting the subject's movements see second to last picture) It should also be mentioned that 10-15 minutes after the encounter, a female WA-BFRO member thought she was paralleled while walking away from our camp with her boyfriend on the primary vehicle road. Another CA member later heard heavy footfalls several hours later about 30 yds from where I witnessed the subject, and in the early morning hours of about 3:30-4 AM, in a heavy rain, two of us in separate tents heard large (powerful) bipedal footfalls outside our tents (confirmed next day) followed by what sounded like guttural ""doe-like"" grunts. Outside of my tent was a stationed 250D Raytheon thermal imager facing down the pathway of the encounter, but the subject never came close to breaching that pathway (was well behind opposite side of tent) & would've made little difference if it had as the battery life for that unit does not exceed 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Six of us also stayed in the camp one more night (August 19, 2009) and the night was uneventful around camp. But undetermined vocalizations (possibly barred owl) came from the ridge behind us (several miles away) well into the morning. ""RE-CREATION"" picture links in sequence below: (Note)--All ""Re-Creations"" were done taking a digital color picture of the immediate sighting location & the roughly 15-yard window the subject remained in the whole encounter, making it black & white to give a generic ""thermal effect."" The subject was colored in using whiteout and should not be gaged by recurring size in each individual re-creation as my artwork has limitations. The idea was to give the reader/viewer a general impressionist view focusing on the various subject positioning I recall & a general idea of how the subject visually appeared to me. All re-creations were completed by me within two to three weeks after the encounter (late August to early September 2007)          Link to Canadian artist Brian Cundle's poster rendition of the sighting event: http://northamericanbigfoot.blogspot.com/2010/09/brian-cundle.html ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More details, potential insight & subjective interpretations from my perspective regarding the subject during the encounter. --At no time did I hear or see the subject vocalizing in any manner ---From the time I first saw the subject behind the tree until I took that imager off my eye while it was in a ""frozen"" but ""departing"" position, the subject remained within about a 10-15-yard window during the whole estimated two-plus minutes of the encounter. --Although it's probable based on time and location, I'm not 100% certain that the ""step, branch break,"" down the trail 5-10 minutes before the encounter can be attributed to the subject I actually witnessed. --I'm certain that without using the thermal imager out of curiosity and boredom, myself nor anyone else in my party would've ever known one of these animals was there. Considering the circumference of the actual camp and where I witnessed the subject, it was strategically positioned far enough back to having no chance of being noticed on a quarter moon night under heavy tree cover. (see camp layout map) --With the unnerved reaction by the subject to my loud whispers and finger-snapping with noisy companions between our line of sight, I believe I saw obvious visual evidence of acute & possibly directional hearing ability of the subject. Furthermore, I believe and it's just my opinion, that the subject never could clearly see me (by never seeming to lock-in visually) but knew my exact presence at all times, maybe either through sound or my likely subconscious, nervous footsteps trying to position myself for better views. -- For as much as I could see, I'm certain I missed a lot when the subject was ""grounded."" Some of the transitioning was so rapid that it was indiscernible during brief intervals in the encounter & can't properly be described. Much of what couldn't be made out in the rapid transitional movements (like when the subject appeared unnerved) was in-between the subject's distinct positioning I clearly recall. Furthermore, during some other brief intervals, partial ground vegetation blockage was also a factor. --At no time was the encounter a scary experience. If anything, it was very intensely ""surreal"" watching ""one"" through an imager as I have so many other humans & Pacific Northwest animals. Part of the absent fear likely also stemmed from the clear visual distance contrast from the subject and myself and being psychologically comforted that so many of my companions were nearby. --Although you can't interpret actual hair from 30-50 yards with this thermal unit, there did seem to be some hair shade (as have some other large mammals I've seen from a similar distance on certain nights) and the subject was undoubtedly void of any clothing. From 50 yds that night while doing the comparison and measuring the subject's distance from me, Paul G's clothing could be easily discerned through the unit as he wore a winter wardrobe with a checkered flannel, vest and beanie. (Note Paul G was measured and compared from roughly 50 yards when he stood at subject's initial positioning and his clothing was easily discernible, the majority of where I watched the subject was about 33 yards). --I saw nothing indicating the subject witnessed was a female (not extremely wide hips, no discernible breasts etc…) and based on size/behavior, it's my opinion the subject was likely a young adult male. ---Based on the agile, effortless movements of the subject both on the ground and standing up behind the tree in the beginning of the encounter, coupled with its profile appearance, I fully believe I saw a more ""ape-like animal"" being then my preconceived notion of what a sasquatch might appear like or actually be. --One month after the sighting, a local friend informed me that a boy scout master he knew personally & his troop had had a late afternoon sighting around 4:00 PM on August 19th (the day after my encounter) about 3-5 miles as the crow flies up-country from our camp location near a small lake. Coincidentally, our camp experienced nothing unusual our last night (August 19th). Several months later, the same friend also stated that he'd driven by our camp location and saw several hunters butchering and skinning elk right in broad daylight. Not uncommon during hunting season in that location I've been told. --The area continues to be a hot area as one of our WA-BFRO researchers had an almost identical but more brief & distant thermal sighting with the same X200xp unit, 1/4 of a mile from this location about 10 months later. On that expedition, several people reported much of the stealth & dexterous behavior I'd witnessed the previous August and emailed or called to inform me upon returning home.",Yakima County,Washington,Summer,yes
A knocking noise sounded like a limb was being being used to hit a tree this noise was late at night after midnight it  woke me up was like 10 to 15 knocks and then was quiet for  what seemed like 20 mins and the knocking started again.   This went on just like the first time the knocking was even in its rythem and happened three more times that night.,Yakima County,Washington,Fall,no
"Never saw anything but 4 years ago my friend, his son and I went camping up near Mount Adams ( A very remote campground) and we were hearing strange screams right before nightfall. Shortly after dark we could hear something messing around on the outskirts of our camp, breaking large branches and such. Around 12am or so my friend was going to bed and unzipped the tent and something very large jumped and ran off from behind the tent. Whatever it was shook the ground to point that I could feel it from about 15 feet away. Later that night I awoke to garbage cans being hit or thrown..at first far off but moving closer over a few minutes time. Then I heard something walking at the edge of camp and it grunted loudly. I had woke up my friend and his son and without my being aware he said a really loud ""BOO"" as I was intently listening for sounds in the forest this scared the holy # out of me.....about had a heart attack. We heard no more sounds that evening. Fast forward to this years trip.......same camp..... Our first two nights were un-eventful. But our last night was not. My friend, his 20 year old Son, my 8 year old Daughter and I were at the same camp. My friend, because of the previous experience, decided to do a little tree knocking, there were no replies. An hour passed and we began to hear screams. First we heard it off in the distance to our south and 3-4 minutes later it was to the NW. I am not sure if whatever it was was traveling or if it was getting a reply from the other location. We probably heard these calls 3 times. All was quiet for a couple of hours. After dark we began hearing something around camp. We heard what sounded like very large branches being broken out in the forest. We shined flashlights out in the direction of the sounds and it would be quiet for a little while. Well this went on for 3 hours or better and we decided to go to bed. My friend, my Daughter and I were sleeping in a little RV and his 20 year old Son in a tent as he was being brave and said he was not freaked out by the noises. Everyone drifted off to sleep except me as I was listening to see if anything came into camp. Aprox. and hour passed and I heard what sounded like something running and breathing very heavy, with an almost grunting with each breath (kind of hard to explain) going right beside the RV and it sounded rather large. I actually thought bear for a moment. I listened intently but heard nothing. Now this night was a full moon and the windows on one end of the RV were faced in a way that allowed the moonlight to shine through them (These windows are aprox. 5-6 feet from the ground). While sitting there listening for any more noises the level of light decreased and I could notice the change in light through these windows. I could see no shape however. (I thought cloud? But this was a cloudless night and the timing of the thing running a few moments before made this a little less possible.) I wanted to look out, but the position in the RV that I was sleeping in would have taken a lot of movement and to be honest I was having these thoughts that if I was to look out that I would see a face staring back at me. I just listened to make sure that my friends Son was not being attacked. I wanted to wake up my friend but did not want my Daughter waking up. I heard no more sounds for a while and eventually fell asleep. I had been sleeping for a while and was awakened to the RV shaking and something trying to get in through the doors. I heard knocking and my friends Son yelling ""open the GD door"". He said he had been sleeping and was woke up by banging on trees and heard something running in the woods around the tent. He said that he heard something next to the tent and that this side of the tent went dark. He said that he was listening and heard what he thought was his Dad say my name and then laugh. He said that the voice sounded very close to his Dad's but he could tell it wasn't. He said that this is when he ran for the RV with a big stick in his hand. We heard nothing else this night. The next morning my friend went a little ways up a trail and knocked on a tree and kept hearing a series of whistles in the trees. Now I am not sure what this was as we did not see anything. The nearest campers to us were aprox. a mile away on the opposite side of the lake. They were a family with Grand parents and did not seem like they would have done all this for a practical joke on complete strangers in the middle of the night and I would think we would have caught a glimpse of them in our flashlight beams earlier. We want to go back here with some night vision and a couple more people next year to see if we can see anything.",Yakima County,Washington,Summer,no
"Early one morning while scouting for mule deer and elk, I had also been hoping to fill my bear tag at the same time, as bear season was open. This area is not well known for black bear activity - but they are present. I was tipped off by a neighboring camper a few nights earlier, of a watering hole in a clearing a few hundred yards from camp and assure I would see plenty of elk and mulies. I was looking forward to snapping some pics with my new camera as well as having a shot at a black bear. I woke up well before the sun, gathered all my camera gear, rifle, pistol, and chair and headed out. Just inside the clearing, there is a grove of trees providing perfect cover for an 80 yd shot at the watering hole. Just beyond the watering hole (approx. 30 yds further) is the other side of the opening where the forest begins, and a massive game trail - like grand central station for the critters. I hunkered down and was immediately attacked by mosquitoes - like flies on sh*t. I couldn't let the constant squeeter slapping blow my cover so I cut two holes in my stocking cap, pulled it over my eyes and zipped my coat up over my neck. This helped, and I did not move a muscle for the next 30 minutes. Facing east, I was staring straight at the game trail entrance as the sun had just started coming up beyond the trees. Then, out of nowhere - just to the left of where I was patiently watching - it moved into view. According to google earth it was 110 yds away and all it did was stand there, full-frontal and facing me. ""I'm looking at bigfoot. I'm looking at bigfoot."" - must have repeated a thousand times in my head. As I mentioned earlier, the sun was just coming up, and it glimmered off its fur perfectly in the dark woods. I could see its full outline from the elbows up, as it was standing behind a fallen tree that was still hanging on to its roots a few feet off the ground. There was enough light that I could barely make out the shadow of its jaw line and chin - well below its shoulder line. And the hair - its hair was beaming with light from behind. I could not tell what color it was for sure, with such a contrast of color between dark woods and brilliant sunlight beaming off it, but I will forever remember the outline of its body and long hair. So many things ran through my head, during the (approx.) 45 second encounter - with a camera on my left, and two firearms on my right - I could not gamble making a move for my camera, and I have NO reason to shoot a squatch. There was no threat, and through all the racing thoughts I came to the conclusion that this may be the last encounter I ever have. I soaked in every second. Though I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt what I was looking at, I waited to see if it was just a reflection of trees and shadows moving with the rising sun - but as soon as this thought had come to mind, the creature moved like a ghost behind a large tree and out of view. I waited a couple hours longer, and two mule deer bucks came running from the north and stopped at the watering hole - between me and the edge of the trees where I had seen the squatch. Still eager to get a photo of the deer, I stood up to get their attention and snapped a few pics of them both looking at me. I got a few nice pictures before they took off towards the area I saw the squatch. Just before before they reached the treeline, they stopped dead in their tracks, sniffed the air, looked at me, stomped their feet, sniffed the air again, and looked back in my direction, before cautiously entering the woods and out of sight. At this time, I grabbed just my pistol and camera and proceeded across the opening to the area of the sighting to gauge the height of the fallen tree from which behind I saw the squatch. I am 5'10"", and when I stood behind the fallen tree, the top of it came to my shoulders. This is the height at which I saw the squatch from its elbows up. With my camera in hand, and my pistol holstered, I did not feel any threat - but I really didn't want to stick around much longer either. I searched briefly for footprints, but there was so much grass, weeds, and pine needles I just assumed it was better to head back to camp and reflect. I am looking forward to another opportunity to observe.",Yakima County,Washington,Summer,yes
"Let me begin by stating that my mother Renae Sampson is a member of the BFRO and has gone on multiple expeditions, is fairly knowledgable about Bigfoot activities and sightings, and has shared her stories with me. I am somewhat of a skeptic, but believe there is always a possibility of discovering new creatures on our planet, but until this past weekend I had never experienced anything first hand. Growing up in central and western Washington, my whole family has always enjoyed the wild outdoor spaces whether camping, day hiking, fishing or just exploring old mountain dirt roads. This past weekend June 7-8, 2014 was no different... We made camp at the upper Bumping Lake campground using 2 small tents and a picnic table tent. The weather was in the upper 70's to low 80's during the day, we had 3 young children ages 4-9, and 4 adults age 37-62. (Whether that's notable or not, I don't know- but I added it in case.) My brother and his family joined us only for the day leaving around 5pm. We rode bikes, played in the water, ate lunch, hiked around the campsite on animal trails, normal camping activity with kids. One notable strange thing happened happened around 6pm... My 4 year old son needed to use the restroom and we decided to walk through the small island of trees at the end of the campsite paved loop. We startled a deer in there and I remember thinking ""that's strange to see a deer in here with so much human activity around the campsites"" I wanted to try and take a pic with my iphone and tried to walk a bit closer. My son stayed right at my heels, also being curious if we could get closer. I don't know why, but I always call wild animals ""baby"" and spoke to this deer: ""it's ok baby, we won't hurt you"" etc. (And I honestly never would, no guns or any type of weapons for my family) So we move forward, the deer slowly walking away a few feet, nibbling some leaves, me moving forward, Deer looking back at me, deer nibbling leaves, the deer never being more than 20' away from us, until we emerge from that small island of trees, cross the paved road into an empty campsite near the restrooms. It was almost as if it wanted me to follow, it kept looking back at me, but never running off. My son looks up and says, ""I don't want to follow that deer anymore, Mama"" and I try to coax him along a bit more. He was adamant and did not want to enter that part of the forest. I follow the deer a bit more trying to get that ""one great nature photo"" and then I lost the deer over a small rise. I even crouched low to see if I could spot moving legs-nothing. What is interesting about this is that my son is very outgoing, adventurous and always wants to lead the way. Was some instinct holding him back? (Whether this is notable or not, I included it anyway) After dinner, my mom, son and I went for a drive up the dirt road (1800) all the way to the end and back. Got back to camp about 9pm, made a fire, sat around and told stories, watched bats flying, watched for shooting stars. The night was calm with not much of a breeze to notice, few clouds in the sky. The moon was in its waxing gibbous phase and visible in the southern sky straight up from our campsite. I put my son to bed in our tent, then stayed up with my mom at the campfire till midnight. I simply couldn't keep my eyes open any longer and quickly fell into a deep sleep. Here's where it gets interesting and something I will never forget... Maybe its the cool night air (approx 54F) or the glass of wine before bed, but I had to wake up and go potty. As I lay trying to convince myself to get out of my warm cozy sleeping bag and don my slippers to outside behind the tent, I hear off in the far distance toward the South part of the lake a ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" and my brain races to identify the sound. By the time I realize I am hearing rocks clacking together I hear it again, in a definite pattern ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"". Now I am wide awake, on alert and must pee now! I have to say, I did not much want to get out of my tent at this point. Nevertheless, I did, and quickly went potty behind my tent and hopped back into bed. I remember thinking ""what the hell is that?"" I grabbed my headlamp and noted the time on my watch as a few minutes past 2am. I wanted to remember this and tell my mom in the morning. I would say I listened to this clacking occurring repeatedly every couple of minutes for approx. 10 minutes and somehow fell back to sleep. Here's where it gets freaky! I'm fast asleep and become aware that there is the sound of stampeding animals right behind my tent. Still in a haze of sleep, my head on my pillow up against the wall of our tent, I feel what seem to be fingers touch the back of my head in what I can only describe as a ""hard petting"". I feel the end of my tent beyond my feet on the inflated bed my son and I are sleeping on LIFTS UP! And then its placed gently back on the ground, like floating down! I reach out to touch my son and he is facing away from me with his arms and hands under the covers. He had not touched me....what did?! I hear something brush the side of the tent! And then, I hear my mom's voice in a loud shouting whisper: ""Jennifer!!"" I am awake and alert and scared at this point and try to call out to her but my voice won't come out. I am barely able to utter a weak mumble sound.  I hear the clacking rock sound closer now, in the near distance south of our tent in the ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" pattern, with a responding ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" from further away maybe south-west, maybe even from the other side of the lake. And then the closer sound again this time, rapidly: ""CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK""  I have to tell you I was completely petrified with fear at this point, could not move or speak. Somehow, like a miracle, I fell back to sleep. Again, with that night chilly air I woke with the need to pee. I woke up thinking ""Something weird is going on here"". I could still hear the occasional clacking far off now, in the southern distance. No longer feeling petrified with fear, I don my slippers, quickly potty behind the tent again and dash back to bed. I notice the sky is still dark, full of stars and the moon positioned in the south western part of the sky right above the mountaintops. I did not check the time, but imagine it was around 4-5am. I don't remember sleeping well, filled with fright and thought ""next time we're sleeping in my Explorer"" and then it was 8am. I could hardly wait for my mom to wake so I could tell her what happened. I rose before Mom and my son and walked around our campsite looking for any sign of a visitor. No Bigfoot footprints. My tent was still firmly staked down. Couple of fresh deer tracks on the trail behind our tents. WHAT THE HECK??!! Mom woke up and I recount my story to her of the night's events. She states she was not awake at all during the night, and doesn't remember calling out my name. The funny thing about that is that I've gone by ""Jen"" for 20 years, and only my parents still call me ""Jennifer"". Weird. We pack up camp with the intent of going to the other side of the lake for a hike along the Cougar/Swamp trail for a spell before we headed home. We wanted to get to the Boulder Creek crossing and were curious if my 4 year old son could make it. He did, and we had fun taking pics along the way, had a snack break, met some folks on the trail on the way back, not too hot, not too breezy...all in all a nice day. When we were about 15 minutes away from our cars at the trailhead, we heard a sound. A sound my mom and I have never heard before. We were in a thick wooded portion of the trail: close to the water on one side, and fairly straight up elevation on the other- meaning the hillside rose steeply upwards. I do not think either of us would be able to easily climb up this land covered thickly with Kinnickinick, Bunchberry, ferns, and many many trees growing closely together. This is where the sound came from...directly above us! Hard to describe, but sounded like this: ""HUMPF"" like coming from deep within a large animal, kind of guttural, but not a growl. And it was loud. And close. And no other sounds like the animal moving or walking through this thick vegetation. We all stopped and looked at each other wide-eyed. We looked up into the woods a bit but could not see anything through the thick plant life. I was a bit on edge and thought, ""let's get out of here!"" We continued the hike back to our cars and I remember thinking to myself, ""that was weird"", and what a weird night I had just experienced and why isn't my mom talking about this more?? She's the Bigfoot fanatic in our family! Didn't she think that was strange? Maybe she was meant to forget? Or not notice? I understand Bigfoot may have powers beyond our knowledge or capabilities. You never know... So, that is my story to the best of my recollection.  It scared the hell out of me. I literally felt paralyzed. I am intrigued.

"September 14 My adult son, daughter and her son and I all hiked into Twin Sisters Lakes from the Deep Creek Campground around 1 1/2 to 2 miles. My son and were planning to spend 2 nights and daughter and her son, just for the day. We set up camp, ate lunch and just enjoyed the day at the lake and surrounding area. Many hunters were leaving due to it being the last day of Bow season for Elk so we watched them being packed out by Mules and Horses. Beautiful day in the low 80's I would say. My daughter and her son left around 3:30 so it was just my son and I and the 2 dogs. He fly fished and I just relaxed and read at camp. At dusk we started a fire, ate and had a glass of wine.  I did a couple wood knocks but did not hear a response. Around 9:00 we went to our tents with a dog in each for the night. At 1:30 in the morning the dogs needed out to do their business so we did also then back to bed. My son snores terribly so my sleeping was intermittent. Our tents were between two trees about 8 feet apart and a foot from each other and the trees. I awoke sometime in the night and raised up because I heard the dog moving around. He was staring out the window towards the Lake. He did this several times that night, didn't bark or growl. I heard nothing that night except my son and the dogs snoring. September 15 Awoke early and we decided to take a hike to Blankenship Lakes and Meadow. Spooked a Rough Grouse on the way and met 2 Bow Hunters on the trail. They had no luck but said where they were camped at Blankenship was busy with coyotes during the previous night. When we reached the Lake one of the dogs Maggie would not leave Bob's side so we continued on. Got back to camp around noon. When dusk arrived we made a fire and I decided to do a call, one loud Whoop and immediately across the lake we got a return whoop and Elk on both sides of the lake started bugling back and forth to each other. Also a coyote yip then it was quiet for awhile and then more Elk bugles and a loud knock on the hill behind our tents. By this time my son was wide eyed and couldn't believe what he was hearing. I had told him of all of my expeditions and reports from others so he was a believer but had never experienced it for himself. We decided to go to bed and he immediately went to sleep snoring right away. I on the other hand was awake and listening when I felt something heavy stepping on the side of my tent where my arm was lying , I slowly moved my arm not making a sound because I didn't want whatever it was to know I wasn't sleeping. I felt my head being pushed down also as it went by and a loud swoosh on the tent fly. I was petrified and tried to call out ""Go Away"" but nothing came out. I was mute, but continued to try and say something to wake my son up. He and both dogs were snoring. After it passed my tent I continued to hear soft bipedal footfalls around our camp. I did not sleep all night. Around dawn I heard another wood knock. We got up , packed up and left. Very memorable trip for us, shook me up but I still want to have a sighting and will keep doing this.

"My friend and I rode snowmobiles about 8 miles into a wilderness area. No one had been in the are for at least 2 days because previous tracks were covered by Saturdays storm. We turned off the main road and onto a side road and rode a few hundred feet before we stopped at a bridge crossing a stream. As soon as we took off our helmets we heard a loud howl/moan sound that lasted 8-10 seconds. We looked at each other in shock. Another howl followed about 8 seconds behind it and then we head a loud bang on a tree in the opposite direction. It was like a super loud woodpecker just pecked once. A few seconds after we heard a large tree branch break in the direction of the howl and then heard a third howl. Two more loud wood pecker sounds then followed with about 5 seconds in between. The scream seemed like it was from a mile away, but in the dense trees it was likely much closer. The wood noises and loud break sounded like they were within 50 yards or so. Then it was silent for about 5 minutes and we started to get ready to leave and the howls started again, but seemed like they were twice as far away. After about 6 more howls with 5 seconds or so in between, we decided to leave the area. Neither of us have ever heard anything like it. It seemed like it had an amplifier and we were the only people within about a 8 mile radius. I listened to the ""Ohio howl"" and it was close but longer and more fluctuation in some of the moans.",Yakima County,Washington,Winter,no
Heard at least four howls in the morning between 4-5 am at silver beach camp grounds. The sounds were about a mile away but could here clearly in the morning. Thought was wild life or maybe a person. Then looked up a video on YouTube of people using a parabolic sound dish recording Sasquatch vocalizing sounds when I arrived back home. Was able to recognize the sounds from the video to what I had heard. It was a terrifying sound. The best way to describe it was a howl sound between a man and a ape. This is the link to the video of the sounds I heard:  Hopefully this video helps or explains my experience.,Yakima County,Washington,Summer,no
"I was riding in my mom's van, at 7:13 pm, as she drove past the recently built storage facility on Eagle Road, I looked out the right window and saw a black or brown (it was really dark outside and I could see it clearly so it had to be brown) human-like shape move around the far corner of the facility, and I didn't see it come around the other end. It wasnt a person because of its height. I dont know what I saw, but I'm certain it was not a person or a bear.",Wood County,Wisconsin,Winter,yes
"I live in Biron, Wisconsin.  It was around 6-7 p.m. and my friends and I went out to the forest close to my house and I did a couple ""whoop"" calls. About 10 seconds after I did these calls, we heard a long howl that lasted about 5 seconds in length. We are convinced that this could possibly be a Bigfoot howl. As we were leaving, we heard three ""whoops"" in the same direction as we heard the howl. After we heard that, we all ran back to the house",Wood County,Wisconsin,Winter,no
"I have spent my whole life in the woods in this area. Me and my stepson were ginseng hunting in an area that I had been through multiple times. We decided to try the opposite side of the ridge that we had went to the weekend before and harvested a pretty sizable amount of ginseng. As we drop down from the ridge and began going around the hill we noticed that the area we were in was a little darker, due to excellent shade cover from the large timber in that area. As a result there was a lot of moss, chicken of the woods, and other mushrooms. As we started to go through the swag, off of the small point we were on, we began to hear some unusual sounds. One of the sounds resembled almost like laughter.  What was so strange is that it was low but echoed. You could see really good under the timber. There some small trees, but no thick brush so we kind of ignored it and wrote it off is just an unusual sound of a bird. We heard this sound 5 or 6 times. Just a few seconds after we heard a low growling sound that didn’t resemble any kind of bear or coyote that I hadn’t heard. I yelled “hey bear you get out of here” in an attempt to possibly scare off any kind of predator in the area. I had seen several bears in the area over the years and actually harvested two with my stepson. The next moment a loud sound that almost resembled an ambulance siren or a siren on a vehicle, but with more depth in the tone rang throughout the woods. Then a few seconds of a sound that was a long huff huff huff that was very guttural and grungy came through the woods. We stood silent until he said he wants to leave.  I’m scared as he was. He was only about 13 at the time. I told him to just hold on and I’m sure it was nothing. I had a Glock 21 SF with me which is a 45 caliber handgun and was pretty confident that we could handle anything in the woods. Suddenly, about 60 yards away, the tops of trees started swaying back-and-forth and you could hear the sound of feet moving quickly in the leaves, but it didn’t sound like any bear, deer, or squirrel moving. The steps were heavy, yet so fast paced. There was a grouping of trees, beech, maple, and hickory, between 8 inches to 24 inches in diameter. None of the larger trees were shook. The smaller trees 8 inches in diameter to 16 inches in diameter were swaying back-and-forth violently and the tops were banging against each other. I looked around and observed that there was no wind blowing at this time. The large timber in the area somewhat blocked our view of the creature doing this from where we were standing, but occasionally we would catch a glimpse of what appeared to be a large creature on two legs approximately 6 to 7 feet tall moving from one smaller tree to another before shaking the tree hard enough that it would bang the tops of other trees. This occurred for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. It is notable that the creature always positioned itself to the backside of the tree, keeping the tree between us. It stopped for about 30 seconds. There was no sound in the woods whatsoever. Then we heard quick footsteps going through the leaves. As we moved trying to catch a glimpse of whatever it was, we could see a large creature brownish black on two legs moving quickly, but as it moved between the trees. It was so fast that we could only catch glimpses of the creature. It was putting distance between us. All of a sudden the trees started shaking again. Trees 6 to 8 inches in diameter were being shaken violently. Branches were flailing from the tops as they banged together. Then a tree began to crack and within a few seconds it quickly fell. The tree was probably 20 to 25 feet high, give or take, and 6 to 8 inches in diameter. After this tree had fallen, another tree similar in size, but much taller began to shake violently until it cracked and fell to the ground. 5-6 trees were broken in this manner. Then as quickly as it started, it all stopped. You could hear the sound of something crossing the point in the distance with heavy, quick steps. We decided to go down into the area. Well I did, he was in shock and near tears, but I had the firearm so he went with me. There were all sorts of small trees freshly broken in the area. The larger trees we had seen broken were all broken in the same direction, pointing downhill. As we investigated the area where the creature had been, we heard what sounded like rocks being rolled down the hill. I looked up on the point in front of us and could see large rocks, the size of a basketball, maybe a little larger, being rolled down the point, not toward us but close enough that it would obviously scare us. I looked up toward the ridge of the point. It could see a creature near a large, old squatted. I thought it was a stump at first, but then it quickly moved to the side of the tree, blending in with the shade and remaining hunched or squatted. I stared at what I thought to be creature momentarily. The woods were completely still. I turned to my stepson and told him that we would go exactly the way we came. As I was leaving I remembered I had a pb&j sandwich in my bag. I laid it on a stump as to say I respect this as your home and to say eat this instead of me. I have been back through the area and heard strange sounds, but never had any more incidents. Each time I leave a small gift like a pop tart or candy bar. Close to that area are large stacks of rocks that are uniform and almost rectangular. The stacks are usually level on top and measure 2’ h by 6-7’ l and 4’ w. Several areas have large dug out holes against old logs that appeared to be either wallowed or some kind of bedding area. I do not fear this creature in the least, but respect it immensely. The property is now leased by a hunting club and I am worried that they will disrupt his home as they do not respect Mother Nature, but rather feel above it.",Wyoming County,West Virginia,Fall,no
"My family had moved from the city of Rochester to Wolcott, a small town about 50 miles east of Rochester in July 2003. We were living in an old farmhouse on approx. 77 acres of woods & creeks near Lake Ontario. This incident happened sometime between the 18th-20th of September. My sister's birthday is the 20th and I recall a small group of family and friends were visiting the house for that occasion. My future-stepfather took a small group, including his brother, my four sisters, and a few other friends out for a ""tour"" of the property. I was not present, I had stayed behind at the house. As the group returned to the house, my stepfather lingered behind in an area of the property where a strip of woods runs between two fields. My stepfather was in the field closer to the house, we'll refer to it as field #1. He noticed to his left something in the woods and turned to see a tall, white, hair covered creature standing just off the path in the woods. He ran ahead and told his brother, but did not tell the rest of the group. His brother rushed into the house to get me, telling me that something was in the woods and I should come see. I followed him outside where my stepfather relayed the story to me and the three of us walked back to the area of his sighting. As my stepfather showed me the spot where the creature had been standing, we all noticed that the creature was still present, but had moved further back, to field #2. At this point, the three of us were standing in field 1 and looking through a small strip of trees at the creature in field 2, maybe 200 yards away or so. My observations of the creature are as follows: It was approximately 7' tall, covered in hair, white but with a dark area on the face, think and lanky, with a head that came to a slight conic shape. It was too far to distinctly see its face but there was a definite darker colored area where the face would have been. The creature was clearly observing us, as it paced back and forth, looking around trees, standing up taller, ducking down, etc. to get a better look at us. After approximately 45 seconds, the creature retreated to an area where we couldn't see it clearly. I walked through the trees into field 2 to get a better look at it, but it had disappeared. The area where it had been walking was matted down, but there were no distinct prints. Judging by nearby trees, I estimated its height to be 6.5 - 7 feet.",Wayne County,New York,Fall,yes
"My brother and I were canoeing on Lake George, in N.Y state at about sunset. We headed south for 10 minutes to an area known as Deer Leap. At lake side it is a boulder strewn area with cliffs rising 600 feet above the shoreline. As we were begining to come on to this area we saw something standing on shore. It was brownish in color and standing straight up with it's arms at it's side. It was about the size of a small man and very thin. Its body was facing south, looking down the shorline when it suddenly turned its head directly towards us and looked very intently. We  whispered to each other and watched it while it watched us. We were 2 grown men paddling parallel to the shore and about 200 feet out but we could not summon up the courage to go in closer. This thing had a strange look, almost a crazed grin. Like a giant Lemur.  The sun was set now as we continued to watch it in the shadows of the mountain. As it was standing next to an old, dead pine tree, it turned and climbed, sloth-like up the tree about 20 feet to the first and only large limb and onto the crook of a branch. We paddled back around and as we approached it again cocked its head directly at us, after a minute or so it turned its face downward into its body and became as if it were a part of the tree. Just a lump on the crook of the branch. You would not know it was there unless you saw it move. I have been in this area all my life and have never seen anything like this and have not seen it since. In my searchings I have found reference to a creature found in the woods of New Hampshire. Back in the 30's they called it the ""Wood devil or Stick Men"". The one thing incommon is they are able to blend into trees to avoid being seen.",Warren County,New York,Spring,yes
"It was in the afternoon on a snowy winter day.1985. My friend and I decided to go for a winter drive(which was very common for me when it snows).We ended up at the entrance to ""Ice Cave Mountain"". Of course the attraction was closed. But we wanted to go for a winter walk and thought it would be pretty secenery in the untouched snow covered grounds. We stepped over the gate and began to walk the driveway towards the woods. We were talking with eachother in normal voice tones. The snow was about shin deep so as we walked, we were looking towards the ground to step through the snow as we go. As we approached the woods, we both looked toward the woods to see the snow covered trees and scenery, when all of a sudden, it took us by surprise as much as we took him by surprise. It stopped in its tracks to look at us. It was if it froze in place. (You see, these grounds are not occupied at all during the winter, so it was totally unusual for us to be there)It looked at us as we were frozen in our tracks staring back at it. It was about 150 feet from us. It was very large with brown fur/hair all over it's body. It was absolutely human looking. It was walking upright just like humans walk. When it looked at us, it didn't react in any deffensive way. It just waited a moment or two as if it was waiting to see what we were gonna do. When I was finally able to speek, I asked my friend if she sees what I see. And with that movenment, it seemed to have been frightened by us and started to walk away very fast,but it didn't run. It just had a very long stride. It looked back at us again while it was leaving. Now mind you, we were the only people in the area. But we were curious and stupid.We decided to follow it. But then again we were very scared. We attempted to try and find footprints but were unable to. Maybe because we were too scared to look properly. I know what I saw. I'm a 42 yr old mother of two and am not looking for anything from this.I just want to finally tell what I saw. And I know what I saw.I saw Bigfoot!",Ulster County,New York,Winter,yes
"This   is a somehat long story but i will try to shorten it the best i can without leaving out anything. I also reported this to the Western New York bigfoot association and contacted back and forth with thier director Mike George. He was suppose to come down and meet me so that i could take him out to the location this vocalization occurred , unfortunatley he never made it down. This happened to myself and my long time friend and hunting partner back in winter of 2001. We were out grouse hunting one day in an area know as ""Michigan hill"" , a state owned piece of land 13,000 acres big near Richford , NY . We had hiked a mile and a half or so off the road with no luck finding any birds when we came upon a large thickly wooded gorge with a creek running through the bottom. We decided to head down the very steep hill into the gorge hoping that in the thick pine and old apple trees would be a few grouse. Once reaching the bottom and crossing over the creek we were both stopped dead in our tracks by a sound which made both of our hairs stand on end. A series of  screaming growls which i can only describe as i have before as a 700 pound hyena with a serious bad attitude had stopped twop grown men with guns instantly. i will tell you as i told the WNYBIC , I have been hunting for over twenty some years and have never , and I mean never heard anything such as this in my life.Well anyway , after two or three of these vocalizations ,which were coming from only about 30 yards away or so through the very thick trees , we decided to move a little closer. What happened then was what really put the scare into us , As we split about 10 yards apart and started to move towards the sound it seemed to move around my partner almost as if it were flanking him , when it moved you could here it walking through the snow and breaking branches and smaller tree limbs , it definitley weighed alot more than in my opinion him and i put together. We moved a little more before it vocalized a few more times  and moved to our left evn farhter as if it were trying to get behind us. Needless to say with all this happening and the constant barking of the dogs from the farm up by the road we were actually getting scared and nervous, whatever was in those trees didnt want us there . after about three or four minutes i glanced over at my friend whom at that time was down on one knee with his gun shouldered as if whatever was there was heading for him . He looked at me and i motioned to him that i thought it was time to leave that area and whatever was down there and headback to the road and truck as quickly as possible. We did just that moving very quickly but cautiously, the whole time looking back over our shoulders till we made the truck. We never spoke to much about what happened but never went back to that place. A year or so later i told something of the story to another friend and huning partner of mine , he was playing with me and said ""hey maybe it was bigfoot"" , up until then i never thought about that at all, then one day the same friend played me some supposed recording of bigfoot that he found on the internet and my jaw dropped , a sound i hadent heard since that day a little over a year earlier was playing in front of me , belive me when i tell you the chills were enough to kil ya. I had him record the sounds and i called my hunting partner who was with me that day (he had moved to florida ) , i played the sounds over the phone and he had the same chiiling feeling. It was indeed , 100% positive , the exact same vocalizations we experienced that day hunting. A month or so later i contacted the WNYBIC and he i sent them this story along with the tape explaining that the sounds on the tape are exactly what we heard that day , i wanted to know exactly what they were. They responded with two of their own tapes which contained even more supposed bigfoot vocalizations. i could not believe i was hearing the identical sounds we heard that day , then They even top it by telling me that there have been several other sightings and vocalizations from that area and that they would like to come down and check it out for themselves , that was the last contact i had with them , a letter along with the tapes from 2/4/02. I just wanted to share our story as i have never in all my years been a believer in a creature like this but will tell you my mind has remained totally open since then. I am not exactly sure what we heard or what was there , but i will guarantee that it was there.",Tioga County,New York,Winter,no
"In the fall of 2000 my wife saw a large blk figure walking across a field and into the woods approx 300 yards from our home.My children stated that they saw something big and hairy behind our house approximately 3-5 days later. We never told them about moms sighting. also we had recently purchased the property and the home had been vacant for some time (curiousity ?) in the fall and winter of 2008 I heard some rather strange sounds when i was in the woods across from my home this happened when I was walking,hunting and cutting firewood. The first incident was when I was walking in the woods looking for deer sign for the upcoming hunting season.What i heard was something striking a tree with a piece of wood very loudly and repeatedly 5-6 times. I tried to duplicate the noise in an attempt to communicate but to no avail.Prior to the banging I would swear that i was being watched.I also found a strange footprint at the base of a cluster of cedar trees, the print was 8-10 inches long but it was muddy and the print was not clear but looked as something slipped in the mud the print was human like but not human.the cedar tree was stripped of bark for some reason.The next incident was while hunting I heard 2 somethings that were very heavy walking on the ice and breaking through I thought that they were very large deer and that i would see them as they were coming towards me but they suddenly veered away and were never seen. The reason i know that they were heavy is that i weigh 270 pds and I was walking in the same area and i did not break through.I have heard long screams at night coming from the same area and the latest incident I was cutting firewood and when i shut the saw off i heard a large amount of vocalization coming from approx 1/4 mile away. These noises could only be described as monkeys yelling at each other,and the reason I say that is ,while on vacation in TN I went to a outside zoo near Nashville and there were white faced monkeys there and the vocalizations that they made were very similar.I downloaded a file from the Sierra sounds and played this for my wife, she said those are birds i hear them all the time outside. I proceeded to tell her that the noises were of a sasquatch not birds and i showed her the web site that i copied it from.I recall as a child seeing what i remember as a hairy man near a creek when my brothers and i were playing there, and we always felt that we were being watched when we were there.this creek was on my family's property back in the woods not far from the swamp. The incidents above took place in the woods between a swamp and the lake.",St. Lawrence County,New York,Fall,no
"Driving westbound my brother and I were doing approximately 60 miles per hour on Rte. 224.  Three fire trucks from the Odessa-Montour fire dept. were coming in the opposite direction with lights and sirens on as they were responding to a call. Suddenly, this creature darted across the road from our left to right.  It was illuminated by fire trucks and our headlights.  I yelled to my brother, ""Don't hit that ki-d"". That was when we realized that it was not a human or animal.  We thought the lead fire truck was going to hit it.  We believe it was spooked by the lights and sirens and  panicked.  It ran extremely fast on two legs leaning slightly forward with what we estimated today to be a stride of five to six feet as the road was approximately 30 feet wide. It was completely blackened from head to toe and approximately six to seven feet tall.  It swung it's arms in an ape-like fashion at its sides as if to gain momentum.  Unlike the way a human pumps their arms and fists for speed when running.  That's how we knew it wasn't a person. The creature did not look in either direction as it darted across the road.  It acted like a scared animal.  We returned to the site this morning and did not find any tracks, etc.  Ground was completely hard and dry at the time.  No alcohol involved.",Schuyler County,New York,Fall,yes
"My incident was no visual in the sense of seeing bigfoot itself.  another family member of mine has seen him before.  So it has been common in the area.  My incident however was simply footprints in the snow.  I saw the footprints in the snow in the morning.  We had snow the night before.  The footprints started around a tree in front of our house.  I followed them and they led around the back of our house to another tree.  The footprints then circled around the area in front of the tree about 4 full circles and then stopped.  There were no footsteps leading from the circle to anywhere else, as well as no footsteps back to the front of the house.  I put a garbage can lid over one of the prints to preserve it until I could take a picture of it.  Unfortunately I never had a chance.",Rockland County,New York,Winter,no
"My wife and I were driving on a blacktop secondary road at approx. 11:30 pm, while returning home from my stepson's home in Berlin, N.Y. This is a relatively rural area, with large expanses of forested land, just west of the Massachusetts and Vermont state lines. About 1 mile from our home we came around a bend in the road where another road, Davitts Lake Rd, intersects the road we were traveling, Blue Factory Hill Rd., and forms a ""T"".  At this ""T"" there is a street light, and opposite Davitts Lake Rd, on the other side of Blue Factory Hill Rd. (the road we were on), is a 4-5 foot embankment sloping away from the shoulder of the road to a large field, also sloping downward from the road and ending at a line of trees approx. 100 yards from the road. There was (and still is) a barb wire fence which runs parallel to Blue Factory Hill Rd. along this 4-5 foot embankment, with the fence post set halfway down the embankment so that the top wire of the fence is about the same heigth or perhaps slightly higher than the shoulder of the road. It is at this location at the abovementioned time, under the illumination of the street light that I clearly saw a figure in mid stride hurdling over the barbwire fence, whose body was completely covered with red colored hair, not unlike the color of a red fox. The hair on my neck tingled, as while I was certain of what I was seeing, my mind was coming up blank as to any reference of what it actually was, and I felt a sudden rush of fear. I said to my wife "" what the hell was that"", and as our vehicle drew near the spot where I first spotted the figure, I could not draw myself to stop the vehicle, or even look in the direction of the field on my left where the figure was running. Using the telephone pole from which the street light is mounted as a point of reference, I would estimate this figure to stand approx. 7-8 feet tall, and was totally human-like in respect to moving upright. At this point I will turn the report over to my wife who watched this figure run down the field. I did not see the figure leaping over the barbed wire fence - but I did see it running through the field.  It was very large, covered in red hair as my husband described and running in an upright position swinging it's ""arms"" back and forth as it ran.  I knew it wasn't a bear or deer - and as I watched it disappear into the wooded area, I had goosebumps on my neck and knew I had just seen something which was very unusual. This event occured several years ago, actually back in 1988. Naturally we have been reluctant to share our encounter, as when doing so with even our closest friends, we are met with comments such as basically we're nuts, seeing things, or it was surely a bear or deer. But we do not know either to be able to run upright like a human! So--- having found this website we guess it's time to report this, as after viewing some TV programs about ""bigfoot"", the only illogical logical conclusion we can come to is that our red haired figure was in fact a bigfoot, and since we saw this, they must exist, for we are both absolutely certain of the description of what we saw.",Rensselaer County,New York,Summer,yes

"1973 was the first incident. I was 9 years old. I am now 43. My family have moved here in Otsego County, New York, in 1972. We live in the town of Maryland -- a family of 6. I can remember on a hot summers day, it must have been in July or August of 73, walking the family land, in an open field, looking to the top of the hill, which is wooded and about 30 acres. We had a dog with us. The dog went crazy, and started running to the top of the hill. It looked up there and saw what seemed to be a very tall hairy figure, not running, but not walking, to the top of the hill.  I thought it was trying to get away from the dog. I was about 50-75 yards away from it. I did tell my parents, only to have it brushed away, and never spoken of again. 33 years later, February 2, 2006 6am, snow on the ground, slight wind, and 33 degrees. I was dropping my children off at the sitters just before 6 am, and was heading to the car. About half way to the vehicle I heard what sounded like the Ohio Howl.  It was to my left across the road, and over the creek about 100 yrds away. I only heard it yell once. I did not stick around long to hear it for the second time. February 10, 2006. I was out feeding my horses at around 7:15 pm, still snow on the ground, and about 22 degrees out. When the very loud, and very long scream appears from the valley below in which i heard the first one on 2-2-2006. Mind you, there are no houses or domestic animals in that area.",Otsego County,New York,Summer,no
"The incident occured in 1985-86 not sure which.  A friend and I went into the woods to stay the night in a cabin by a small creek that my friends brother had built.  The cabins floor was about two feet off the ground to prevent flooding.  It was about 11:00 pm when my friend and I heard someone at the door which we had locked.  Someone was trying to get in.  When we asked who was there, no one answered.  Whoever or whatever it was moved around to the side of the cabin where the window was.  All we saw was a shape in the window.  The top of the figures head reached almost to the top of the window, which I estimated to be some 8 feet off the ground outside.  We were terrified beyond belief.  We huddled in a corner not getting a wink of sleep all night.  The next morning we cautiously went outside to investigate.  The ground was frozen with patches of snow that were riddled with footprints from everyone the day before.  It wasnt until I crossed the stream that I noticed a set of footprints that looked like someone had walked barefoot up the side of a steep embankment that ran along side the creek.  I called my friend over to look.  The stride was to wide for either of us to make especially since they were going up the embankment.  We just figured that someone had come in the middle of the night to mess with us.  At the time there were snow shoes that looked like a big version of someones bare foot circulating department stores.  I guess neither of us wanted to believe that it could've been anything else.  To this day no one has confessed to trying to scare us that night.  It just makes me wonder.",Oswego County,New York,Winter,yes
"I cannot say for sure what this may have been, but I've never heard anything make a ""noise"" quite like this since, until listening to your audio samples. The area I grew up in is very rural in nature with only a few small towns here and there. The city of Rochester lies approximately 30-min to the east, and Buffalo about 45-min to the west.  My families land consists of 50 acres of farmland, with dense undergrowth and brush as well as a small corner of a much larger forrest on approximately 20 of those acres. A large man-made pond exists at a point where the dense underbrush begins and is bordered on one side to the north by a large/thick hedgerow which also has dense undergrowth on the otherside. About the time I was in 5th/6th grade, my friend Nat and I were back at the pond with mine and my younger brother's 10-pump single shot BB-guns. Call us sick or what not, but we used to throw Rice Krispies into the pond and try to shoot the Sunfish that would come up to eat them. Anyways, we had gone around the southern and western sides of the pond and decided to move to the northern side because it was somewhat more shallow and easier to see our ""prey"". Once we reached the northern end, the pond's edge was only about 10 feet from the hedgerow mentioned previously, and since we were pre-occupied with our ""hunt"" we had our backs turned to the hedgerow. After growing tired of shooting, we decided to call it quits. Noting that both of us still had BB's primed and chambered, we should get rid of them before going back to the house. Nat, not exactly being the country-boy, didn't know what I meant, so I said ""Just fire it off into the brush"" or something to that effect, and with that we both simultaniously fired into the brush. That's when something decided it was time to scare the crap outta us. Immediately after firing, something about 10 feet into the brush began screaming/howling sounding exactly like your recordings only with bass or ""power"" and shaking the small trees and brush violently. We couldn't see what it was due to the thickness of the hedgerow. Whatever it was then took off heading back towards the forrest, making the screams the entire way. Judging by the way the entire hedgerow from top to bottom was shaking vigerously whatever it was, was big. This all happened within a matter of seconds, and it was gone. After comparing the location and volume of the sounds as it moved, the distance it covered was impossible for a human to accomplish in that thick of vegetation. Nat and I literally looked at each other and screamed, and then hauled-ass the 500 meters back to my house. Nat moved to North Carolina in 8th grade and I never heard from him again. I don't know what it was, but I've heard of Bigfoot sightings down near Clarendon, where I used to play paintball a few years ago as well as on the Indian reservation towards Buffalo. I was only about 10 years old when this all took place, but proceeded to spend the rest of my childhood playing/hunting in the woods and consider myself ""knowledgable"" in a forrest environment. I have never heard such screams/noises since.",Orleans County,New York,Spring,no
"I had parked my Volkswagen beetle at the junction of Rte. 17A and the Appalachian Trail, intending to camp out overnite along the trail.  I then hiked south on the trail about 4 miles, along a ridge that overlooks Greenwood Lake until I was perhaps just above the New Jersey line.  Since I had hiked this section of trail before I knew of an ideal camping site - a large outcropping of bedrock that rises about 10 feet above the surrounding terrain, and has a sheer drop off on the west side with a small swampy area on that side.  I unrolled my sleeping bag and bedded down as soon as it got dark, enjoying the magnificent view of the sky before dozing off.  About midnight I awoke for some unknown reason, and shortly after heard the most horrifying high pitched scream I had ever heard out in the woods, perhaps a 100 yards to my southeast.  I scrambled out of my sleeping bag, and quickly put my boots on.  Then the scream repeated itself, and I was positively terrified, as I knew it was miles in the dark to my car, and I had only a small flashlight.  Thinking to scare off, what I assumed was an animal, I screamed back at it, and was aghast when it returned my scream.  Several more screams were exchanged and then silence.  With my heart racing, I gathered up all the stones I could find in depressions in the rock I was camping on, and began throwing them in the direction the loud scream originated.  Then, to my horror, another scream came from a direction south-southwest of me, which astonished me as I heard no noise of movement, and in those days had extremely good hearing.  I hurled rocks in this direction, with more screams being exchanged.  This process went on for another hour, and then quiet, but I stayed up all night.  In the morning I checked the area where the noise had originated, and discovered it was covered with dry leaves, which made me more puzzled why I heard no noise.",Orange County,New York,Summer,no
"This was years ago. I'm 38 now, but when this happened I was 14. My father worked with a guy who had some prime property in Naples, NewYork. Being that I was 14, I was not old enough to have a hunters license. So my father let me go with him, and I had the task of pushing the deer to him. We got to the property just before daylight, Dad went about 200 yards up the the road, and I went the opposite way, and went into the woods. It started getting light out, and I remember that it was real cold that morning. It had snowed the day before but there was only patches of snow on the ground. I had been walking through some thick sections of brush and was getting tired. I was walking in a shallow gully with a 20ft ridge on both sides of me. I walked up the ridge (I believe) to my left. There was a large tree laying down, so I sat down with my back against it. I could see pretty clear, the whole area. I guess I dozed off for a bit. I woke up, hearing what sounded like a large branch had snapped. I looked to my right, and then to my left, but as I looked to my left (paning the view) I saw something on the the oppisite ridge across from me. There was this large dark figure just standing there turned my way. It had heavy fur like hair all over it. I could'nt make out a face because it had long tangled hair hanging down. Now this figure was maybe 30 ft away give or take. Being cold as it was, I remember it breathing through the hair in front of its face (that really creeped me out). I sat there up against that tree with my heart racing out of my chest, afraid to move. This went on for minutes, feeling like a lifetime.Then all of a sudden it took one step torwards me (I think it was its left leg).That's when I jumped up, turned, and ran as fast as I could. I remember, I had run into a high fence line earlier that morning, that took my some time to scale. Well I jumped through this area of the fence from total terror of what might be chasing me. I managed to get to the road and ran full sprint to the car which was a ways down the road. The car was locked. Thats when I looked around, but nothing was after me (thank god). I waited about 2 hours and finally saw my dad walking down the road. He was pretty upset with me leaving the woods as early as I had but I told him what happened, and what I saw, and he did'nt believe any of it. He figured I was just cold and tired making it up. I had never even heard of bigfoot when I was 14. I didnt know what it was, but I know for a fact that it wasn't a bear.This figure was dark brown but lighter colored around its shoulders and thighs. Its arms were, I thought, too long for its body. I figure it was at least between 7 to 9 foot tall. It had to weigh 4 or 500 lbs. at least. From reading some of your articles, people have said it smelled bad, but I didnt smell any odor that I remember.",Ontario County,New York,Fall,yes
"During bow season I and my brother were hunting. We got into the woods before daybreak. As daylight was approaching the woods never got active. No animals or birds were heard or were visible. About 2 hours into the hunt, all was quiet. It was then that I heard a very loud wood knock. Startled the hell out of me. It was northeast of me in the swamp. My first thought was, ""You can't be serious."" A wood knock here? I stayed put for another hour, hour and a half. Then made my way back to my vehicle. My brother was already there. His first words were, ""Did you hear that wood knock?"" We discussed it and came to the conclusion that something weird was going on. About 3 weeks later during gun season the same damn thing happened in the same area.",Ontario County,New York,Fall,no
"My 2 best friends and I would take night rides into Harriman State Park late at night to see what we can spot at night, i.e. bear, deer, fox, etc. Its a beautiful park and the solitude at night in the off season makes the park special. Creepy too! As we were driving the very windy Garden Valley Rd we had to go slow due to the turns and danger of the steep drop offs on the road side. I was a front seat passenger, high beams on. Driving no more the 25-30 mph.  At the max viability of the headlight I see the outline of a large upright being running across in front of us and leaping the bank on the high side of the road, instantly disappearing into rhododendron thickets. I freaked out upon first visual and alerted my friends. The driver hit the breaks, windows open we could hear thrashing of the ground from running  but the sighting was over. My friend the driver did see movement but couldn't make out what I made out. We both agreed on the sound of it fleeing up the steep slope. What solidified my two friends belief in what I saw was the look of fright and amazement on my face. Features of the upright being I saw were large thick long hair covered legs, human like strides, and tall enough that the headlights did not focus above its midsection, so I couldn't make out facial features.  We were not drinking or doing any illegal substances. I would love to be able to speak to the park worker who had a sighting in the same location. I am so excited to finally be able to tell this encounter.",Orange County,New York,Fall,yes

"The town of Albion is small, there are woods, fields & streams just on the outskirts of town. With the time being around 2:00am in the morning, there were no sounds of any traffic or industrial sounds. The weather was excellent; no clouds, not the slightest breeze. My girlfriend and I had turned in for bed at around 1:30-1:45 am. We were talking to each other, just little chit chat when we both heard a far off howl/moan! At that time of night and that there was no wind to disturb the trees and hamper what we heard, it sounded like it came from the south maybe a mile or a mile and a half. The sound started low and kept going up in pitch for about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other and said ""What the hell was that?!"" Now what really freaked us out is that it did it again, only at around 6-7 seconds! It was like, ""Ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-----"" Now I consider myself an excellent observer with a very keen ear. I can hear things that most people either don't, or just overlook. What we heard was NOT anything mechanical nor was it a whistle. It sounded like it traveled over some distance; not like it was down the street. I am very fimiliar with all kinds of traffic noises that are associated with small towns. Even before we had heard it, we both had noticed how silent it was for quite some time. After the howl/moan, there was an echo. The sound went up in scale and didn't go down like a siren or anything like that. It wasn't a cry for help or a wolf nor any coyote (I have heard a coyote three times, once from only 200 yards)",Orleans County,New York,Summer,no
"Hi, in the end of Jan. 2003 my wife and I were spotlighting for deer and coyotes in Waterport NY.  We were driving my 4x4 truck through the apple orchards. The lane went through a large hedge row with a small stream in it. When we got to the other side we spot-lighted along the woods. About 75 to 100 yards there is an old spot they use to dump garbage.  There was something standing next to the old fridge. I have hunted these woods since I was a little boy and never had seen anything like this. Its belly was about the top of an almost 6 foot tall fridge. I know it was an animal because its eyes reflected in the spotlight. It looked almost like a bear standing on its hind feet but there is no bears in this part of the state. As we sat there trying to figure out what it was it started to turn and walk into the woods. Wince we didn't have any weapons on us we just got the hell out of there.",Orleans County,New York,Winter,yes
"I was driving from my grandparents house to my girlfriends house one night in early fall at about 10 pm.  The area I was heading to is up in Tughill plateau which is a very dense wooded area.  I was about 2 miles outside my hometown of Sandy Creek and had about 3 miles of woods to drive through to reach Boyelston, where my girlfriend lived. The road I was traveling on was very narrow with steep banks on both sides.  I had just made a left turn around a corner where the road begins to get steeper and head uphill for about a mile when I saw something beside the road out of the corner of my right eye.  I started to slow down out of instinct because people are always hitting deer around this area when this thing just jumped out into the road in front of me and began to quickly cross to the other side.  I slammed on the brakes and skidded to a stop, which gave me just enough time to see some of it in my headlights as it finished crossing the road and up the bank into the woods and disappeared. I only really saw it from the side and the back so my description isn't really any different from any you may have heard.  It was somewhere between 6 1/2 and 7 feet tall and very strongly built.  Its head seemed to be attached to its shoulders directly because I couldn't see a neck.  But it had very long dark hair, mainly black with patches of brown.  I can't believe I originally thought it was a deer.",Oswego County,New York,Fall,yes
"I am 25, and have 2 younger brothers, 9 and 14. I wanted to take them camping, just a simple outing so we chose that spot even though there are no trails as it is not too far from home and was easy to get into. Durring the evening while making our campsite, near an area where an old logging road or something was, as well as near where a tornado had recently gone through and knocked trees over, my brothers told me they heard some funny noises. I told them it was likely the road far away or something and did not pay much attention. Latter that night while toasting marshmellows, we heard what sounded like a fairly large animal close to us. I am a seasoned camper and thought it odd that a larger animal such as a dear or something might approach us and the fire so close, and thought it might have been a bear, or maybe a racoon. I have a high powered 5 watt spott light which I got out and scanned the woods arround us, but saw nothing (there were some brush and things that something could hide behind if it was trying. We then kept hearing the noises, but each time I would turn on the light and scann arround, we saw nothing. I found this odd as I have never known an large animal that was smart enough to come arround a campsite repeatedly and still remain hidden--other than a human. Then we went to sleep--my little brothers were luckaly not too nervous, and I was starting to get the clue that this might be a sasquatch incident, and as I have heard they are peacefull I was not too worried. Durring the night I was awakened by the sound of whatever was there, very distink noises, like a cross between a person, ape and ??, it was repeating a calling sequence with a deffinite pattern, sounded to be 30 yard away perhaps, something like ""hhum-umph hhur-umph"" etc, but the consonants were not well defined, it was very gutteral. The next time I was awakened I heard it start the sequence with a very load yoddeling or something, then the same pattern as before. Then another one responded from a quarter mile further perhaps, then another one responded even further--they were deffinitely communicating. I was quite nervous, as I also had a strong sense that at least one was very close to my our tents, and my little brothers were not in the same tent as me, but I called to them and they said they were fine. In the morning We discussed it, and they though it was a sasquatch without me suggesting it, though I had already concluded that was the most probable. We heard them again while having breakfast, and both my brothers saw something though I did not. We all had monoculars, and my one brother saw something near some bushes--he said when he looke at it it froze, then ducked deeper into the shadows. We all stated walking in that general dirrection, but stopped when we heard a load rock crashing down about 25 yards to our left. We left a granola bar for whatever they were and when we finally left, we found no foot prints, although the ground was hard and we did not stray from our orriginal trail. I am going back this weekend to look for more evidence.",Otsego County,New York,Summer,yes
"I was getting ready for work one morning in the late spring of 2004.  I walked out of my bathroom and there is a window in my bedroom, directly outside of my bathroom door.  I thought I saw something peripherally and turned to look and see what wildlife might be outside my home this day (my backyard is completely wooded).  I gasped and RAN back into the bathroom. What I saw when I looked out the window was no further than four feet from the back of my house and striding by the window when I looked.  Whatever it was stood about 7 feet tall and was covered in brown hair.  It was moving very quickly and was walking on two ""feet"".  I don't know if it saw me, but I saw it. I stood in my bathroom for about a minute trying to gather my thoughts and I peeked out.  At this point, I saw nothing.  I'll be honest, for the past year I've tried convincing myself that there was a bear outside and that I couldn't possibly have seen what I did see.  I do remember specifically saying for the next two weeks (around the house to my significant other and my daughter only) that [a] bigfoot lived in our backyard.",Otsego County,New York,Spring,yes
"I was having a small camp fire last night alone with my small dog who at the time was sleeping. First there was something moving through the wooded area to my left. Sounded like it was on two feet and moving towards some neighbors houses. Wasn’t alarmed by this, although it was dark and there was no flashlight the neighbors do walk through there from time to time. My dog wasn’t alerted at all. This part of the incident may be just coincidental but it’s what happened next that I’m curious about. About five to ten minutes later to the left of me way off in the distance there was an obvious wood knock then immediately to the right of me in the distance but in that direction is the Great Croton Swamp was a reply wood knock and then immediately after that another from the left. Then nothing. I’ve never heard anything like that before. It was about 11pm and the neighborhood was quiet and in my opinion it was an obvious call and response. Are wood knocks usually so instantaneous or do they usually have some time in between?",Putnam County,New York,Spring,no
"A friend and I had decided to do some cross country skiing on the property owned by some neighbors.  We started out behind my house and worked our way into the woods.  There is an old logging road about a mile in that we hooked up to.  It was a sunny day in January, with a steady but light snowfall.  Along the way we had taken note of different tracks, as the area is home to abundant wildlife.  At this point we had come across several deer tracks.  We were studying the tracks and noting that most were not fresh, as they were already filled with snow.  There is a point in the trail where it splits and you can go to the right or left.  We chose right and continued back in.  This route is fairly short and takes about 10 to 15 minutes to reach the end where it abruptly stops in a an open field.  At this point we chose to turn around and start back out.  When we reached the spot where the trail had split, we were coming down a slope and nearing the fork when we noticed what looked like fresh tracks in the snow ahead.  They looked fairly big in size, so we decided to stop and have a look, thinking we may have stumbled across some bear tracks, which are not uncommon to the area.  When we reached them, both of us just stared,  They were huge!  And deffinitely NOT bear tracks.  Both of us are avid outdoor people and hunters.  Growing up in the area we are both familiar with identifying tracks.  To us it looked like our own feet (bare feet) only much larger and wider.  I'm not sure of the size, but with an educated guess I would say about 1 and a half to 2 feet in length or so.  We started to think that someone had possibly come back in and done it as a joke, knowing we were in that area.  The problem with that is, the area is accessible by vehicle but only an ATV or snowmobile, as the trails, although sufficiently wide, are no longer suitable for regular vehicles.  We found no tracks coming in or out from any vehicle, nor did we find any evidence that someone had walked in on foot or otherwise, beside ourselves.  However, no person could have made such tracks.  The tracks came out of the woods on the right side of the trail, crossed it and dissappeared back into the woods on the left.  We ventured into the brush on either side and noted that they were consistent in both directions.  There were no human shoe or barefoot prints to be found anywhere.  What really scared us was the realization that the tracks were fresh.  We had passed that same spot only ten or so minutes earlier and saw nothing, so we had to assume that whatever it was, had passed behind us after we went through.  That sent chills enough through both of us to get us moving back out double time.!  I should also note that the width of the trail is about 6 or 7 feet.  There were only 2 footpirints in the trail itself, telling us that whatever made them, had a very long stride.  To this day neither one of us has spoken of this until now, when a friend referred me to this site.  I still question what I saw, but have never been able to come up with a reasonable explanation as to what it may have been.",Rensselaer County,New York,Winter,no
"On February 15th, 2004 at approximately 9:30 PM in Petersburgh, NY a resident on a rural road noticed his dog chained outside was extremely agitated. He stepped out on his front porch, when he heard several shrieking screams. They were continuous in nature. He stepped in and asked his wife who was watching television to step out and she too heard it scream. The witnesses have lived in Alaska and the male witness is an avid hunter. He has never heard anything of this nature in his life before and described the vocalization as ""un-Godly"" and the loudest thing he'd ever heard before. The next morning, he observed a set of footprints in the snow coming from across the road, up a steep embankment and across the field to the west of the house in a northwardly direction. The strides were described as 5 - 6 feet apart. Note the field was covered with approximately 14 inches of snow. The witnesses' son tracked the foot prints into the forest behind the house where apparently a second set of footprints joined the original set. Witnesses have lived at the present location for the past twelve years and this is the first time anything of this nature was encountered.",Rensselaer County,New York,Winter,no
"Hi, It was october about 1030pm I was comeing home with a friend from work. you see we run a camp ground in the summer in bear mountian state park in NY. But we stay thier all year round,i love it. in the summer thier is lots of noise. We have as much as 300 kids at a time, overnite for 3 months. In late august every thing winds down. while the kids are thier you dont see much wild life. Even the deer, which we have a lot of,seem to find some where else to live. guess they dont like kids. It takes about a month for the woods to come back to life. this is the best time of the year because it is so quit. During the winters i do other work out side the camp to make money. this night I wasnt driving so i like to watch what the head lights find. the road are windy so the light ofen pan the sides where you might see a racoon or a bear. well driving in to our camp thier is a few s turns. when i saw some thing siting on a boulder about 30 to 40 yards up on the hill. I freaked, I asked my friend if he hsd seen that and he said what. I said back up and he did. when the lights hit it I said stop! wow It was brown hairy but you still saw some skin. It wasnt sitting it was crouching on all 4s. it ha dbeen stairing at my friends cabin, where his wife was alone. i was stairing right at it and i was close. when the head light hit it it sat for 3-4 sec stairing, before it leaped from a crouched position about 9 feet to anouther rock. It stud up and began to run away on two legs. I saw it run for about 15 to 20 feet before i couldnt see it any more. it was running down the other side of the hill. my friend still didnt see it. I asked him to drive up this little acsess road to get more close. but it was gone.",Rockland County,New York,Fall,yes
"I was fishing on a boat at Lake Kanawauke at 9:20pm on August 10, 2010. We where heading to dock the boat. We heard and seen a big splash we thought it was people. So we asked them to stop but nobody responded we proceeded to head into shore when we noticed another big splash. So then we stopped and we noticed a foul smell, like a wet animal. We then looked towards the bushes and a tall thin tree was shaking very fast back and forth. Then we noticed a big bolder thrown through the air toward us, it hit the water. That's when we realized what the splashing was.Then we noticed a man like figure with red beady eyes when we flashed the light at the bushes about 2 feet above the bushes was the eyes. So we started to bang the boat with the oars to scare away whatever this was.Then we heard a loud scream as we loaded the boat on the truck and left.",Rockland County,New York,Summer,yes
"Good Day, I am An Avid outdoorsman I have spent my entire Life in the woods Hunting, watching and Tracking Animals & Birds I am writing to you within Minutes of what I have just seen, While out in the Woodlot across from my Residence With My Chesapeake Retreiver we walked for some distance across a frozen Swamp and Ahead of us I seen bare ground so I followed my dog that way she was undisturbed in her activity like she is every day and in front of me I noticed a line of Human shaped Bare foot prints, and I asked myself who in the heck would be out on the ice in their bare feet this time of the year and upon closer inspection there were toes and one one foot a long misshapened toenail I have several pictures on my cell phone and have a knife lying next to the print for size verification, this discovery comes after taking my dog out to use go to the bathroom and hearing what sounded like a stick striking against a tree which I found odd also this i heard three times then it stopped.",St. Lawrence County,New York,Spring,no
"Not quite sure what to write.  I was hunting with some friends of mine outside of Addison, NY in Nov. of 1986.  I was the top man on a drive.  I crested a hill and decided to take a break. Things were pretty slow as far as hunting.  Typical fall day no overcast, dry conditions.  I just finished eating one of many Babe Ruths when something caught my attention about 50 yds. east of where I was sitting down. I looked towards the direction and noticed something that was black run very fast down the side of the hill.  It happened so fast I wasn't quite sure what I was seeing.  It appeared to be about my height.  I stand at 5'9"".  It ran with incredible speed. What is odd about the incident is that I had time to eat and sit down on a tree.  At the time I was not even in stealth mode.  I always scan the area before I stop for breaks just in case I may have missed any game. I almost felt as if whatever it was, it was observing me and had enough.  It was definitely in a hurry to leave.  I observed it for only at best, 5 seconds.  I could hear it break deadfall once I lost sight as it ran away. Their are bears in the area I hunt, but this seemed to be taller than the average black bear.  My first thought was it had to be a bear.  I remember standing up startled once I had made eye contact with the object running.  It appeared to be at eye level. My second thought was maybe it was a black angus cow that may have been loose from a farm.  I was a little spooked from the incident.  The same feeling you have when you stumble upon a grouse at close range.  I thought again and surmised if it is a bear, it is a very large one. I was not far from the end of the deer drive.  I left the area and met up with my friends at the truck.  I had asked them if they had seen a bear or any deer.  They all said no.  I did not tell them of the incident. On 08-05-95, the Corning Leader newspaper wrote an article on a possible bigfoot sighting near Rathbone, NY.  This area is not far from where I was hunting.  There were casts taken as well as hair samples by the Dept. of Enviormental Conservation.  To my knowledge they were submitted to Cornell University for testing.",Steuben County,New York,Fall,yes
"While hunting with a friend on his farm during deer season this past Nov, we were walking the creek bottom to get up to a stand of pines at the edge of a small swamp on his property, after walking about 200 yards we stopped for a bit to listen and observe and maybe jump a deer crossing over, we were there about 10 minutes when we started to hear something above and just behind us, the creek bottom at that point has about 8 foot banks on both sides, we continued to hear the noices get closer, but it seemed to be going parralel to us on the deer trail. having spotted bear recently, we thought it might be one and hoped it would cross about 60 yards in front of us, we moved a little further up and the noises stopped, figuring the bear heard us we stopped, it was quiet for about 20 minutes when it began again, only more hurried this time. at one point I could see movement in the woods and at first thought it might have been a bear standing up, but it kept walking on the hind legs, it turned and came across the creek about 60 yards from us and we just watched it run across the creek and up along the power line on the other side, it jumped down the bank and jumped back up on the other side. We couldn't get a clear look because of the pines and the fact it was really moving when it came across the creek, but it was no bear, we both have been hunting for a good 25 years ech and we agreed it wasn't a bear or any other animal we have ever seen. we listened to it for about another 3 to 5 minutes going through the pines and brush, then the noises just stopped, we went up and back tracked it as best we could but lost the sign just the other side of his farm pond.",Steuben County,New York,Fall,yes
"This account happened on the night of the lunar eclipse back in 2003.  I was camping with my friend Pete in NY up behind his cabin (about 1/4 mile up the hill).  It was about 11pm and we were both in our bags in the shelter we built. Pete was already asleep... I was trying to sleep but couldn't so I was poking the fire with a long stick.  I heard something coming down the hill (heard rustling leaves, etc) but figured it was deer coming down the game trail.  It is tough to tell where sounds come from at night and judge distance in the woods because it's so quiet.... but I figured it was pretty far out (about 150 or 200 yds) moving to our left.  I heard some sort of popping sound like the trunk of a tree being hit with something solid or two 2x4s being smacked together and a few growls (kinda like a lion but higher pitched, kinda like a stomach growling)... I still didn't really pay any attention.  I dismissed the popping as trees cracking and the growling to Petes stomach or a low volume snore.  Whatever this thing was, it circled our camp keeping the same distance away.  All I heard was the rustle of leaves or twig snaps.  I kept hearing the popping sound occasionnally but I still wasn't freaked out.  The sound eventually stopped basically where it I started hearing it.  I starting thinking that whatever it was, it was a predator (showing stalking behavior)... I figured it was a bear, fox, or some other predator/scavenger that thought it was a good idea to leave us alone.  But then I started getting a really creepy feeling that I was being watched.  I thought my mind was playing tricks and I was imagining it...  but it got worse and worse.  I couldn't hear anything definitive in the woods but was still getting creeped out. I could only see part of the woods because only part of our shelter is open... but I started looking around (from my bag inside the shelter, not walking around) and what I could see was lit up pretty well because of the full moon (after the lunar eclipse anyway).  I looked into a stand of trees and saw a really big dark spot... it looked like a broken off tree trunk darkened by shadow... in basically the same spot where the noises stopped.  I looked around the woods a little more and came back to the  same spot where I saw the tree looking thing... and IT WAS GONE!!  I woke Pete up so I could tell him what was going on... and so I would know I wasn't crazy if I heard something again.  I was telling him what was going on when we heard the popping/thudding sound again... He loaded his gun (Pete has a permit to carry a handgun in NY). We got out of our bags and restoked the fire and I heard his stomach growl... really loud!!  He said, ""Man you must be hungry.""  I said I thought that was his stomach and we just looked at each other.  We went to investigate where I saw the disappearing shadow thing and we made a lot of noise to scare off whatever it was (breaking branches, kicking at the leaves, talking/yelling to each other).  We looked around the woods a bit... I heard something up on the ridge keeping pace with us but moving away.  It didn't run, just moved away from us at the rate we were moving toward it.  We stayed up for a little while longer and heard nothing so we went back to bed.  Pete was out like a light and I stayed awake just listening. About 30 minutes later, THE THING CAME BACK!! I woke Pete up as I heard it come down off the hill from the same direction it started from... it was making a truck load of noise banging trees (we think it actually pushed one over too). It growled a few times,  and it's foot steps were really heavy... based upon how Pete and I sounded moving through the woods earlier, this thing had to weigh much more than both of us (I'm 6'2"" and 250lbs).  It came in on our left and walked behind our camp about 30-50 yds... We couldn't see it because it was on the non-open side of our shelter and we didn't want to pop out and provoke an attack.  It kept walking in the same direction and eventually was out of earshot but we figured that was enough of a warning. We packed up and went back to the cabin. There are many screwed up things about this.  First, I've been hunting for years and I don't get spooked... Pete is ex-military and no slouch in the woods either.  But this spooked us bad enough to make us want to pack up the gear at two in the morning (leaving some of it on the hill) and come back to the cabin.  Second, two of us heard this thing so I know its not just my mind playing tricks on me... it was definitely there!!  Third, this thing was massive... It made a whole bunch of noise when it walked behind our camp (more than any animal I have ever heard) and it's footsteps almost shook the ground.  But here comes the most screwed up part of the story.  I have hunted for 15+ years and know what animals sound like coming through the woods... I have heard deer, bear, fox, etc... just about any animal in NJ, NY, PA, and ME... and, ofc ourse, other hunters.  I can tell you with 100% certainty...  THIS THING WAS WALKING ON TWO FEET!! I checked the area the next day and found a large foot print in soft earth... about 3 inches longer than mine and about 2 inches wider (I wear a size 12).  I tracked the animal (or whatever) for a few hundred yards but only found one other definate track and it was the same size roughly.  I also found a dead tree that was knocked to the ground probably the night before (fresh earth on the roots, leaves under/around it disturbed)... I presume it was the large crash we heard the night before.",Steuben County,New York,Fall,yes
"Visual Report: My name is Alan Y. on about Mid-November 2012 I had a very unusual experience that at first kept me very mixed up, but always stayed in my mind until I started doing research. It was about 2 to 3am in the morning. I awoke to go outside and have a smoke. The area of the town of Bath, NY is semi-rugged with hundreds of huge foothills. There is a vast amount of forest, lakes, ponds, wildlife and many state parks. Much of the land is posted ""no hunting"". The hills are super steep, so climbing or hiking is difficult. We rented the full basement apartment of a home. Our entryway was in the back of the home semi-underground. There was a deck over our entryway. I am an ex-US Army Intel (Special Tasking veteran) who served in central America and the Middle East. I am telling you this because I am a trained observer and weigh out everything I see. I am super aware of my surroundings. That morning I went outside and lit up a cigarette. It was very dark this night and cool. Deer would constantly wander through and many times I could be 10 feet from a deer and be silent so as not to spook them. As I lit up my smoke some movement caught my attention about roughly [140] yards directly in front of me to the East. A cinnamon brownish colored figure was pacing back and forth over and over. On each side of this clear cut there is a couple homes. This thing was at the far end by the next tree line pacing back and forth moving towards the last home and back again moving appx. North to South then back the other way. It was moving erratically pacing back and forth like it was confused or undecided if it wanted to go closer to the home. As I looked at first, I thought it was a drunk person? But in all the years I lived there, I never seen anyone out there. As I watched what really caught my attention was it looked like it was floating across the ground as there was absolutely no head bob at all. The ground rose between myself and this entity and went back down on its side so I could not see the lower legs good. It kept on pacing back and forth for about 3 minutes. At the position I was at under the deck, in the shadows, I was not observed by this creature. I’m not a afraid of too much, but for some reason the hairs stood up on the back of my neck and I got into what I call (combat mode). I wanted to bellow out at this entity (Ahh) but something said do not do that. Around 3 to 4 minutes of this pacing, I turned my head for a second and it was gone. I got a fearful sense of where this thing went and had a feeling it may try to flank me around the 2 homes, so I went into the house and awakened my wife and said “there’s something weird out there."" I did not think of ""Bigfoot"" right away, because it was not the Patty type I seen on the P&G film. I also thought that they are in the Northwest, not really here in New York State. It was I believe 6-7 feet tall, a slimmer build. Wide on top and slimmer than Patty. More like a fine-tuned athlete than a body builder, long arms and an awfully long shaggy head of hair (which stood out too me, WEIRD. The reason I even saw it was because there was a light on that home as he was pacing towards, that lit up it and some of the area.  Upon seeing it (after the fact), I realized that there was a hedgerow running parallel to it, and a large ravine behind that that ran into the woods. Across from this property was a road, couple mobile homes then a very step wooded foothill (small mountain). For years this baffled me, and I could not get this out of my mind until I visited the BFRO website and seen at least 6 reports entirely around my area. Thank you, for having a website where we can get these things off our chest.",Steuben County,New York,Fall,yes
"Town of Erwin New York State when I was hunting spring turkeys. I was sitting at the base of a tree location at the top of a ridge line that connected to another ridge. I was calling gobbler turkeys that were on their roost trees, when at which time the gobblers flew down off the ridge from their roost. I was still sitting at the base of the tree having not moved location for a half hour when I noticed something walking on two legs approximately 75 yards away. The thing was about 7 feet tall. I first thought maybe another human was there hunting, but then it was apparent to me it was dark reddish brown from head to feet. This thing was in my view of sight for about 4 to 5 seconds and then went behind a tree and that was the last I seen it. Then about 15 minutes later (I have not moved from the base of the tree sitting on the ground same spot) to my left approximately 30 yards an object hit a tree about 25 feet up in the tree. Then the object that hit the tree hit the ground sounded like a rock. I continued through the area for the rest of the morning with no further incident. I have hunted in New York for 42 years and never witnessed something like this before.",Steuben County,New York,Spring,yes
"I submitted this report, I thing back in october(i think) and did not see anything posted or had any contact and omitted my phone number as no one in my household has been told of this story but will resubmit fully. I'm unsure of exact year but I had returned to the area in june of 2000 and I think it happened the following fall of 2000 or 2001. Me and a buddy(him driving) were out driving backroads spotting deer as it was near hunting season if I recall correctly. We often drove the backroads out here doing just that......spotting wildlife. It was roughly around 1AM. We were heading south on Foster Valley Road in Tioga county New York and approaching one of the main country roads(Day Hollow Road) and were within 1/2 mile of it......or there abouts, traveling about 30mph. As we were approaching the S's we could see the approaching lights of an oncoming car. Their headlights would have shined away to the uphill side (east side) of the road and they might not have even seen the creature due to location, light direction and visible location in the turns. We passed the car at about the same time we passed the creature and the headlights kind of obsured my vision of the creature but my buddy was focused on it and says he was not so bad and he probably got a more vivid look than I did as i lost good clear vision due to eye adjusting to the oncoming glare. The road is a bit windy and as your approaching Day Hollow there is a couple of slight switch back "" S "" turns. When heading south, right along that section there is a very steap bank at road edge to your right side with no guardrail and bank at it's highest might be 15 feet and drops down to a slightly tree'd slightly open flat so to speak. A person could easily jump from the road and land in the flat it is that steap. The S turns are just about as perfectly inbetween the two closest houses to the area. There are NO street lights in that section and a very dark section it is. Due to the direction we were traveling and location of the headlights. Well we could see ""something/someone"" standing right on the edge of the road but on the bank. This bank is extemely short and steap. I would think it be a challenge for any person to stand or climb that bank but here is what we thought of as a person standing right there. It was DIRECTLY infront of us and we could see that it was looking at the other approaching car even though it's headlights were not even close to being fixed on it. We spotted this ""person"" probably around 50 yards away so we had some time to try and focus. Even though the encounter actually happened within a short time frame I can look back on it as if it was slow motion and is permanently engrained in my mind. As we approached this creature we didn't realize what it was or how big it really was till just after passing it. The comments inside the truck were kinda humorous and no offense is intended towards anyone peron inparticular but kind of go along with the sighting. Now the location of this thing in relation to the road and time of occurance was quite quite a dangerous spot for a ""person"" and most people would have probably stepped back away from the road but keeping in mind one step back is about 6 feet down easy. The comments as we approached were with some explitives and without being offensive here something like..... Holy cow, what kind of idiot would be standing there dressed in all black hooded sweatshirt. I don't know but they better step back. Damn it looks like one BIG woman(torso completely visible and appeared large chested with what I'd figure as breasts) Ya and why she all dressed in dark with a hooded sweatshirt on(looking back on it now I'd give a smoked charcol dark grey) Damn they better step back if they don't wanna get hit(we actually slowed a bit due to oncoming car and passing at location of creature so we needed the full road and edge of shoulder to pass the car) The creature seemed to be looking more at the other vehicle and didn't turn to look at us till we were just about to hit/pass. She wasn't maybe five feet from the side of the truck and I looked her in the face out the side window as passing. At that moment we both got a decent look at her face. When she turned to look at us she kind of turned her torso and body with the head to do so. She was obviously big and even though she was standing on the bank, i'd have to say that we saw about 5 feet of the creature from about waist to high upper upper on up and looking back on it now and knowing the bank that she probably had about 4 feet we couldn't see below the bank edge. Her arms wer almost to the level of the road. As we passed and got a glimps of her face the comments continued and were something like....... OH MY GOD is she butt ugly. Ya she is, she had a pig face, did you see that snout of a nose(there was no snout at all but a large very wide open nostraled slightly upturned nose). Man is she ugly, she looks like she got beat with a couple ugly sticks out here in the woods. Ya she sure as hell has one hell of an ape face. At that moment, with the ape face comment. both of us turned to each other to see the expression on each others faces as the realization of what we may have just passed WAS. We did not turn around. we did not go back to look ...... I honestly didn't want to. The reason I say hooded sweat shirt is..... well we've all seen people with one on and we all know how they kind of have a pointed head where the hood is sown together. well she had the same kind of coned head. We didn't realize we were looking at hair and not a sweat shirt. She had a humanish face but man for a human she was very very hampered in the looks department. She was definitely what I would call breasted and large roundish belly and large torso and had to be all of 8 feet if not bigger.",Tioga County,New York,Fall,yes
"Original submission from Doug Pridgen. I have a tape you may want to see. It's that of a few friends drinking around a camp fire up state New York. The tape was shot in 1997 and not looked at until a year or two ago. My girlfriend was watching the TV while we were transfering the tape and said what is that in the tree? I had to rewind the tape ten or more times. I did not know what to make of it at first, but I knew it was not from the wilds of N.Y. state! At first, you think ""big monkey,"" but what the hell would a monkey be doing in the woods of N.Y.? The thing swings from one tree to the next and moves up and down it with ease! It hangs by one arm and pulls its self up and around in this tree at a speed you have to see. It looks to me to be about 5 to 5-1/2 feet in height, dark in color, very strong upper body and fast as hell in the trees.",Ulster County,New York,Spring,yes
Myself and my soon to be fiancé were having a bonfire on her 87 acre beef farm and we were playing Native American music when we both heard tree knocks and vocal “whoops” coming from in front and behind us......we both feel very strongly that we do have a squatch on this property not 1 but possibly 3 She had an encounter when she was a much younger girl here on the farm and heard stories from her father about staying away from the back field at night.....there’s a lotta history here on this farm and as it is one of the last real farms left here in upstate New York Update: As I’m typing this at July 3 10:22am I just heard a very large tree knock followed by a sound of a crashing tree!!!,Ulster County,New York,Summer,no
" It was about 6 am on my way to work at [R****  Ranch] when something came from the right side of the road, out of the woods, and forced me to stop or run into it. It is dark that time of morning so it took a few seconds to get my thoughts together. When I did I couldn believe what I was seeing.""IT"" was somewhere between 7-8 feet tall (at least)with white or light gray hair from head to toe. ""IT"" was standing 10-12 feet in front of my car directly in the head lights so I had a perfect view. The creature was standing facing the left side of the road with a slight left twist to it's body in my direction. We stared at each other for what seemed to be minutes but I can't say for sure how long it actually was. I had absolutely no fear of this creature, it seemed to have a sad demeaner. This creature made no sound at all ( like the screams I've heard about) I do not have any reason to believe it was a male or female. Needless to say I have carried my camera  every since but I believe that it was a once in a life time incident.",Warren County,New York,Fall,yes
"Each occurrence happened over a two week period. Between the hours of 10:30 P.M. TO 3:00 A.M. Lasting from one to four minutes. The First sounds were that of a whirling shrill whistling then a deep thumping and with the lung capacity of a horse being slaughtered... along with various chattering and screams To hear this once is to not to want to hear it again... But it kept coming back almost every night... Sounded about 200 feet away...looked out windows with small flash light but could not see anything. I Really did not want to see what it was, I was too terrified. Our cabin was located between route 9N and the lake [75 Feet from the lake] The mountain directly behind us was Bloomer Mountain.

"I had asked locally about anything unusual in the area specifically anything heard at night . I was following up on a report submitted to this sight in Sabathday Pt. which occured about 3 to 4 years prior to my own investigation, anyhow , my search started in sabathday pt. I went to a local marina right by where the sounds were heard , asked a girl behind the counter if anything strange was seen or heard in the area. to my suprise she said UFO's were sighted in Ticonderoga, Ithen said what about bigfoot and she replied that there was a sighting only three weeks ago in Ticonderoga! I was amazed that i could be so close to an occurrence, she told me that it was sighted at a cemetary in Ticonderoga and that a local vetnarian she goes to was investigating, she gave me his name and directions to his place and to the cemetary, off I went. The Vet was in surgery and the nurse said she knew nothing of such a thing and that the Dr. had nothing to do with it, personally i just got the blow off,so i preceded to goto the cemetery.As I approached the cemetary there was a blueberry and rasberry farm right before it. Istopped there and asked a few questions to the girl behind the counter. She was very helpful and a big smile came over her face when i started talking about it . She had a friend who knew of some local kids who saw it one night, anyway i asked if i could walk around the fields to look for signs of bigfoot since it was a farm where you could go pick your own berries, there had been rain so any sings of tracks would have been washed away. I found nothing in the fields, so off to the cemetary i went. At the cemetary the ground was hard and any footprints would have been gone from the rains . Iwalked the whole cemetary on both sides of the street, along all of the edges and into the surounding forest about 10 to 25 feet in. Upon walking in the trees I came upon a sapling about 8 inches in diameter broken at the 6 foot level , it was about 4 feet into the woods from the edge of the grounds of the cemetary. I stand 5 feet 11 inches and it was broken just about an inch or two above my head. This was a definite sign, the tree was still fresh and the leaves were still green and the break was clean like a snapped pencil, although it was still attached to the lower trunk, in front of this tree was a huge oak about fifteento twenty feet and ti would have shielded this tree from a wind.So Ican say in my investigation that this was not from a windfall as there were other trees around it that were significantly smaller. I took two pictures and did not find anything else at the sight. Next to the cemetary was a house . Iproceeded to the door and rang the bell. A girl about 11 answered , I asked if her mom or dad were home and they weren't. Iasked if she had heard anything strange at night or if her dog went crazy at night or barked alot . She said that she hadn't heard anything and that they don't let the dog out at night cause he barks to much. She also stated that her mom came home one night and saw something in the driveway and that it ran into the woods and she heard branches breaking as it ran into the forest.I then said thanks and went asking around some more at some other houses in the area and came up empty. This was my first investigation into Bigfoot and I came out happy that I did find some evidence, Ileft my name and number with agirl and plan on going back up to the area again.the Adirndacks are over 6 million acres and can sustain a population of bigfoot.",Warren County,New York,Summer,no
